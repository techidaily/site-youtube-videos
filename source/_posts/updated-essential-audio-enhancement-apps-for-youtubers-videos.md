## A Legal Warning for Ripping Audio from YouTube

Is the downloading of YouTube videos, including ripping audio from YouTube videos, legal? Here, we'll have a brief discussion regarding the legality of downloading and converting YouTube videos.

According to [YouTube's Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/static?gl=US&template=terms), it is completely illegal to download, convert, or share the video without getting the appropriate permission from the owner.

However, there are some types of videos that are legal to download, and you can extract audio from YouTube videos falling into these categories:

* **Public Domain:** These videos' copyright is either expired or abandoned. So, there is no owner, and the public can use the video for any purpose.
* **Creative Commons:** These videos are owned by the artists, but they have allowed the public to reproduce and share the content.
* **Copyleft:** These videos are granted free rights to change, share, and reproduce as long as the same rights apply to derivative content.
