## Part 1: How to Find All the Comments You’ve Posted on YouTube?

YouTube allows you to post comments on any video only if you are signed in to your Google account while browsing the streaming platform. Because of this, the portal is able to keep a record of your activities, thus enabling you to track all your comments, and take necessary action such as deleting or modifying them as required.

You can learn how to find all the comments you have posted on YouTube while using your preferred device by following the instructions given below:

### 2\. Find Your YouTube Comments on an iPhone

Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the YouTube app for iOS doesn’t have the feature to view your comments history. However, there is a workaround where you can use a web browser on your smartphone to get this done. The process that is given below explains how to view your past YouTube comments on an iPhone:

**Step 1: Sign In to Your YouTube Account on an Internet Browser**

Launch your favorite web browser on your iPhone (Safari, the default one, is used here for illustration), go to <https://m.youtube.com>, tap the profile icon from the top-right corner, tap **Sign in** from the menu that appears, and follow the on-screen instructions to use your Google account credentials to sign in to YouTube.

**Step 2: Access the Desktop Version of YouTube**

Tap the **More Options** icon from the top-left corner of the browser, and then tap **Request Desktop Website** from the menu that appears to access the desktop version of YouTube on your iPhone.

![Access the Desktop Version of YouTube ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/request-desktop-website-youtube.jpg)

**Step 3: View Your Past YouTube Comments**

Tap the **Menu** icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube page, and tap **History** from the menu that appears. On the **History** page, tap **Comments** from the right pane to view/access your YouTube comments that you posted in the past.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Find Your YouTube Comments on an Android Smartphone

As it is with iOS, the YouTube app for Android doesn’t allow you to view your comments history either. However, the workaround of using a web browser works pretty well on Android smartphones too, but with a few tweaks. The process of doing so is given below:

**Step 1: Use a Web Browser to Sign In to Your YouTube Account**

Launch **Google Chrome** on your Android smartphone (you can use any other web browser of your choice), and go to <https://m.youtube.com>. Notice how the interface automatically changes to the desktop version. **Note:** If the desktop version of the website isn’t visible, you can tap the **More** button (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner of the browser, and check the **Desktop site** box.

Next, tap **SIGN IN** from the top-right corner of the YouTube page, enter your Google account credentials in the box available on the **Sign in** screen, enter your password when prompted, and sign in to your YouTube account.

**Step 2: Choose a Web Browser (for Confirmation)**

When the confirmation box pops up at the bottom, choose your preferred web browser, and tap the frequency of its usage for accessing YouTube. For instance, choose **Chrome** and **Just once** to use **Google Chrome** to access YouTube only for this session.

**Step 3: View/Access Your Past YouTube Comments**

Once you are signed in to your account, tap the **Menu** icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube page, and tap **History** from the menu that appears. When the **History** page opens up, tap **Comments** from the right pane to view and/or access your past YouTube comments.

## Part 2: How to Find All YouTube Comments Your Channel Has Received?

If you own a YouTube channel and have posted several videos there, it is likely that you also have received a decent number of comments. Usually, these remarks are pretty helpful as they tell you how to improve your production quality, and what your audience prefers to watch in the future. Therefore, it is imperative to learn how to find all the comments that your YouTube channel has received, and the process given below explains exactly that:

### 1\. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Desktop or Laptop Computer

You can use your favorite web browser on a PC to easily find all the comments that the videos on your YouTube channel have received as long as you are signed in to your Google account. The step-by-step instructions on how this can be done are given below:

**Step 1: Go to the Your videos Page**

Open your favorite Internet browser, go to <https://www.youtube.com>, and sign in to your YouTube account as explained in the previous sections. Next, click the **Menu** icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube homepage, and click **Your videos** from the menu that appears.

![Access  YouTube Your videos Page ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-your-videos-menu.jpg)

**Step 2: View the Comments**

Make sure that the **Uploads** tab is selected on the **Channel content** window, and check the number under the **Comments** column of each video to see how many comments that particular film has received. You can click the number for any video to view its comments.

![Find  YouTube Comments List ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-video-comments-list.jpg)

**Step 3: Hide or Hold a Comment for Approval**

Click the **More** icon from the right of the comment you want to moderate, and click **Hide user from channel** or **Always approve comments from this user** to hide the comments from the selected user or keep their comments on hold until you review and approve them respectively.

![Find  YouTube Comments List ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-specific-user-comment-moderation.jpg)

Note: To view all comments received on your YouTube channel, go to the Comments tab under YouTube Studio, and you will find all Channel comments & mentions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Mobile App

This process is comparatively simpler than the previous one as all that you need to do is download the YT Studio app, and access a central location where all the comments for all the videos can be viewed. The process is given below:

**Step 1: Obtain a Mobile App**

Go to **App Store** or **Google Play Store**, and search and download the **YT Studio** app on your iPhone or Android smartphone (iPhone X is used here for illustration).

**Step 2: View/Access All the Comments**

Launch the **YT Studio** app, and sign in to your YouTube account. Tap the **Menu** icon from the top-left corner of the interface, and tap **Comments** from the menu to view all the published comments for all the videos that you have received on your YouTube channel.

**Step 3: Hide Users and View Held Comments**

Tap the **More** button from the right of an inappropriate comment, and tap **Hide user from channel** from the menu that comes up. In addition, you can tap the **More** button next to **Published** from the top, and tap **Held for review** from the box that pops up to view the comments that are waiting for your approval.

**Note:** Unfortunately, you cannot hold the comments for approval using the YT Studio app. As a workaround, you can follow the procedure given earlier to access the desktop version of YouTube on your smartphone, and then use the method explained in the previous section to get this done. However, it is recommended that you do all such sensitive tasks on a laptop or desktop computer to avoid any errors.

## Part 3: Find Someone’s YouTube Comments by User Name

If any of your YouTube videos has thousands of comments and you need to find a particular one from a specific user, checking each remark manually would be an extremely time-consuming and tedious task. Therefore, it is a good idea to let an efficient application do the job for you.

One program, a Google Chrome extension called YCS – YouTube Comment Search to be precise, can help you with this. All you are required to do is, install the extension, go to the video, and search the comment by the name of the user. The step-by-step instructions on how this can be done are given below:

**Step 1: Install YCS – YouTube Comment Search**

Launch Google Chrome on your desktop or laptop computer, search for **YCS – YouTube Comment Search**, click **Add to Chrome**, and click **Add extension** on the notification box that pops up to install the YCS – YouTube Comment Search extension on your instance of Google Chrome.

**Step 2: Load All Comments**

Go to your or any other’s YouTube video, and click **Load All** from the top-right corner of the YouTube Comment Search panel that is present under the description box to allow YCS to scan all the comments the video has received.

![Find  YouTube Comments mobile ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/load-all-comments-with-youtube-comment-search-extension.jpg)

**Step 3: Search Comments from a Particular User**

Choose **Comments** from the search type drop-down list, enter the name of the user in question in the **Search** box, and click **Search** to fetch all their comments on the video.

## Part 4: How to Edit and Reply to YouTube Comments?

Editing an existing YouTube comment that you have posted earlier, or replying to the one published by someone else is simple. The process is given below:

**Step 1: Edit an Existing Comment**

Use any of the methods explained above to locate your YouTube comment that you want to edit. Next, click the **More** icon from the right of the comment, click **Edit** from the menu, make the required changes to the text, and click **SAVE**.

**Step 2: Reply to a Comment**

Locate the comment that you want to reply to, click **REPLY** from under the comment, type your text in the available field, and click **REPLY**.

## Part 5: How to Moderate YouTube Comments?

If you publish videos on YouTube that may put some impact on people’s lifestyle, you are likely to face criticism quite often. Therefore, you might want to moderate all your comments before they become visible to the audience so as not to spread negativity among the mass. Fortunately, YouTube helps you get this done easily, and the instructions that teach you the process are given below:

**Step 1: Get to Your Channel’s Settings Box**

Sign in to your YouTube account, click the **Menu** icon from the top-left corner of the homepage, and click **Your videos** from the menu that appears.

From the bottom of the navigation bar on the left of the **YouTube Studio** page, click **Settings** to open the channel’s **Settings** box.

**Step 2: Moderate YouTube Comments**

Go to the **Community** category from the left pane, and go to the **Defaults** tab from the right. Next, choose **Hide all comments for review** from the **Comments on your new videos** drop-down list, and click **SAVE** from the bottom-right corner of the box to moderate all YouTube comments that your new videos receive from this point onward.

## Part 6: Tips for Writing Good YouTube Comments

While posting a comment on a YouTube video, it is imperative to keep a few things in mind. Some important tips that might come in handy in this regard are suggested below:

* Make your comment as relevant to the video as you possibly can
* Avoid using harsh language or slangs to maintain decency
* Be genuine while leaving feedback. However, make sure to choose polite words while typing a comment
* In case you want to add some suggestions, make sure to be humble
* Ignore the replies with inappropriate content

## FAQs About YouTube Comments

**Q1) Why can’t I see the comments I posted?**

**A:** If you cannot see your comments, this could be because the owner or moderator has configured the channel or the video to hold all the comments for review before they are visible on YouTube.

In such a case, you are advised to wait for the authorized person to approve your remark before it is published. Another possibility is that the moderator/owner has added you to the ‘hidden users’ list due to some reason. Even in this case, your comment won’t be visible until you are removed from that list.

**Q2) I have enabled** **‘Notify me’ about comments and other activity on my channel or videos, but can’t see the comments on my video. Why?**

**A:** You won’t be able to view the unpublished comments or those from the users you have added to the ‘hidden’ list. To fix this problem, you may want to disable moderation from your channel or the videos, and also unhide the users. The processes of both these configurations are explained in detail in the above sections.
