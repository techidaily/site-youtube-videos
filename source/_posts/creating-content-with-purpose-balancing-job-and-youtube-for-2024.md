I’ve been on YouTube for two years now and it’s no secret that I’ve had my challenges balancing it with my full-time job — and avoiding YouTube burnout. I’m a Social Worker, which means I’m always juggling my time between conducting home visits, returning phone calls and emails, and round-the-clock documentation on my clients. YouTube can be a great source of passive income, but it takes time before you can [make money on YouTube](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization---the-ultimate-guide-to-ad-revenue-422.html).

I’ve had to put a lot of effort into staying consistent with my YouTube channel. Through trial and error, I’ve learned some things that have worked tremendously, while others have been epic fails.

So, to save you and your viewers some of the same struggles, here are 5 tips I recommend for keeping your channel running successfully and having work-life balance!

[1\. Don't force yourself to post on specific days](#specificdays)

[2\. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner](#notebook)

[3\. Check the weather forecast in advance](#weather)

[4\. Create 3-5 videos in advance](#createvideos)

[5. Be creative! Create audios (audio-only videos)](#createaudio)

## 1. Don’t force yourself to post on specific days

I know what you’re thinking - “What?! That’s insane.” The first piece of advice I received about YouTube was to create a schedule of days to post so your viewers look forward to videos. That just doesn’t work for me. Whenever I became too busy with work, I couldn’t stick to my typical Tuesday or Thursday schedule. I think it’s best to focus on how many times you can post in a week rather than a specific day. I try to post at least once a week and that’s my goal. You can always increase as your workload gets lighter or you when you are able to do YouTube full-time.

## 2. Keep track of all your ideas in one notebook planner

A notebook planner is essential for keeping my life organized and on track. When I first started my channel, I had a separate planner just for my YouTube videos – this didn’t work cause I never looked at it. It worked best when I kept track of my entire life, including YouTube, in one planner since I look at it every day. Then I could also see which days I wanted to post a video or see what topics worked best around specific holidays and such.

## 3. Check the weather forecast in advance

When starting a YouTube channel, many YouTubers like myself don’t have the money to afford all the fancy lighting you see other creators using. [I use natural light](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which means I have to make sure it’s going to be a sunny day or at least bright enough for my videos to be clear. I check the forecast for the week on Sunday evenings so I can plan out my best days to film, this keeps my video shooting schedule productive.

## 4. Create 3-5 videos in advance

This week I am on PTO (paid time off) which has given me a lot more time to film videos I can post for next month. Life happens and it can set you back on filming. If you happen to get a major break in your workweek, use the opportunity to film a bunch of videos, edit them, and have them waiting in your pocket. I filmed three videos in one day – I planned and set-up the night before, which made filming much smoother. Trust me, this tip works wonders!

## 5. Be creative! Create audios (audio-only videos)

In the event that life gets too crazy, it’s perfectly fine to do just audio. Many of us are always on the go which means it’s the perfect time to listen to great advice while driving to work, waiting on the bus, or working at the gym. Someone out there would love to hear your advice. I started to do this with my Tea Time Talk Audios and the response was great.

I hope these tips can help you on your journey with YouTube while still working a full-time job.

## Convincing Audiences to Join: A Positive Approach

# How to Get People to Subscribe to Your YouTube Channel

The following is a step-by-step tutorial on how to get more subscribers by asking the right way. People are more likely to do something if you give them a bit of a nudge, and that includes subscribing to your YouTube channel.

There are people who think that if people like their videos they’ll subscribe, so they shouldn’t bother people by asking. This is, simply put, wrong. When people are browsing YouTube their minds are on what video they want to watch next, not whether or not they want to subscribe – unless you remind them.

1. [What is a 'Call To Action'?](#cta)
2. [A More Effective Way of Asking for Subscribers](#betterway)  
   1. [Step 1: How to Hook the Viewer](#hook)  
   2. [Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly](#point)  
   3. [Step 3: Create a Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience](#moment)

## What is a 'Call To Action'?

It has become the norm for YouTubers to ask viewers to subscribe in their sign-offs. A typical CTA (‘call to action’) goes something like this:

> _“Thanks for watching. If you liked this video, make sure to subscribe for more!”_

That’s great. At the end of a video is a good place to ask people to subscribe, but is it the best and only place you should be reminding them? If you take a peek at your analytics and you might find that most of your viewers aren’t watching to the ends of your videos (people have short attention spans).

## A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers

Collins Key is one YouTuber who has mastered asking for subscribers early on, and given that he has over 7 million subscribers himself I’d say it’s working out. Check out the technique in this video collab with Brooklyn and Bailey:

#### Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer

As you can see, the video starts with a ‘flash forward’ to one of the twins saying the heater is on fire and then a reminder of what’s going to happen later – the heater catching fire – is written in the top left of the screen so it stays on the viewers' mind. This is one way in which the viewer is immediately hooked.

![ how to ask people to subscribe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-by-hook.jpg)

#### Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly

Shortly after, while still in the first 30 seconds of the video, Collins gets right to the point and introduces the Twin Telepathy Challenge promised in the title of the video. The hook with the heater catching fire is effective, but it’s not essential. It happens to suit Collins’ style, and it happens to have happened. Getting to the main point of the video quickly – usually in the first 15 seconds, not the first 30 (it’s in the first 15 seconds that most viewers click away) – is vital. People click on videos for a reason, and if they don’t see a sign of that payoff quickly they’ll leave.

#### Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience

It’s only after hooking the viewer in and reiterating the promise of the title that Collins asks viewers to subscribe. The really clever thing about how he asks is that he carves out time in the video for the viewer to comply with his request. He gives 5 seconds and does a countdown.

![ how to ask people to subscribe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-in-perfect-moment.jpg)

Collins Key has been one of the fastest-growing channels on YouTube. He does not implement this strategy in every video, but it’s not a stretch to think it’s had something to do with his success. Instead of simply asking you to subscribe at the end of the video, he creates a part of the video early on – before people who don’t watch until the end will have clicked away – where you feel as if you’re ‘supposed to’ subscribe.

### Polish Your YouTube Videos with Filmora

Even with the above tricks, you may not get the subscribers as you wish unless you can make sure your videos and contents are of high quality. As YouTube is getting more and more popular and more YouTubers are competing for subscribers, you will need to polish your YouTube videos.

As one of the most widely used video editing software in YouTube video editing, [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) provides lots of templates and effects with an intuitive interface, which saves much time.

Collins Key has been one of the fastest-growing channels on YouTube. He does not implement this strategy in every video, but it’s not a stretch to think it’s had something to do with his success. Instead of simply asking you to subscribe at the end of the video, he creates a part of the video early on – before people who don’t watch until the end will have clicked away – where you feel as if you’re ‘supposed to’ subscribe.

The following is a step-by-step tutorial on how to get more subscribers by asking the right way. People are more likely to do something if you give them a bit of a nudge, and that includes subscribing to your YouTube channel.

There are people who think that if people like their videos they’ll subscribe, so they shouldn’t bother people by asking. This is, simply put, wrong. When people are browsing YouTube their minds are on what video they want to watch next, not whether or not they want to subscribe – unless you remind them.

   3. [Step 3: Create a Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience](#moment)

## What is a 'Call To Action'?

It has become the norm for YouTubers to ask viewers to subscribe in their sign-offs. A typical CTA (‘call to action’) goes something like this:

> _“Thanks for watching. If you liked this video, make sure to subscribe for more!”_

That’s great. At the end of a video is a good place to ask people to subscribe, but is it the best and only place you should be reminding them? If you take a peek at your analytics and you might find that most of your viewers aren’t watching to the ends of your videos (people have short attention spans).

## A More Effective Way of Asking For Subscribers

Collins Key is one YouTuber who has mastered asking for subscribers early on, and given that he has over 7 million subscribers himself I’d say it’s working out. Check out the technique in this video collab with Brooklyn and Bailey:

#### Step 1: How to Hook The Viewer

As you can see, the video starts with a ‘flash forward’ to one of the twins saying the heater is on fire and then a reminder of what’s going to happen later – the heater catching fire – is written in the top left of the screen so it stays on the viewers' mind. This is one way in which the viewer is immediately hooked.

![ how to ask people to subscribe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ask-people-to-subscribe-by-hook.jpg)

#### Step 2: Get to The Point Quickly

Shortly after, while still in the first 30 seconds of the video, Collins gets right to the point and introduces the Twin Telepathy Challenge promised in the title of the video. The hook with the heater catching fire is effective, but it’s not essential. It happens to suit Collins’ style, and it happens to have happened. Getting to the main point of the video quickly – usually in the first 15 seconds, not the first 30 (it’s in the first 15 seconds that most viewers click away) – is vital. People click on videos for a reason, and if they don’t see a sign of that payoff quickly they’ll leave.

#### Step 3: Create A Moment - Make Subscribing Part of the Experience

It’s only after hooking the viewer in and reiterating the promise of the title that Collins asks viewers to subscribe. The really clever thing about how he asks is that he carves out time in the video for the viewer to comply with his request. He gives 5 seconds and does a countdown.
