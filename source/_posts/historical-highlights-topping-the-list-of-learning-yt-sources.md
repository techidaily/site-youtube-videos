## Why YouTube channel description is important

 If you have a YouTube channel and if you are not getting the number of views that you wish to have, there are possibly several problems. Maybe, your content is not enticing enough. Or maybe, it is because you do not have the right YouTube channel description. Generally speaking, the description of your channel will provide visitors of a snapshot of what the channel is all about. It appears in the about tab of your page. This is an elevator pitch, which will be an opportunity for you to show other people why they should watch your videos.

 Without a YouTube channel description, visitors won’t be aware of what you can offer. Take note of the fact that their attention span is minimal. They do not have the luxury of time to see each and every video in your channel. They will only click on it if they know that it is going to be valuable if there is any good that they can gain from such. This is where the importance of a well-crafted description enters the picture. Here are some tips on how you can optimize your channel description.

#### 1. Use the right keywords

 Adding right keywords to your channel description will help to make sure that your YouTube channel will appear on the top of search engine results.
