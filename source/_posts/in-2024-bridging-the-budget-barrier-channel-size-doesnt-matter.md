### 2\. Quality Content Is Important

The content you offer through your channel must offer valuable content.

Among all sponsorships, paid sponsorship is the most challenging one. Usually, when you review the products of the affiliate links in your videos, you earn revenues, but, in the paid sponsorship you earn by advertising product and company links on your channel.

Another option is to use the affiliate code to integrate it into an URL that offers profits to a content creator in form of traffic.
