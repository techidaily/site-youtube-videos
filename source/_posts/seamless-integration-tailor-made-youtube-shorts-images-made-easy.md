## Part 1\. Steps on Editing YouTube Videos Using iMovie

To edit a video for YouTube with iMovie, you can follow these steps.

### Step 1: Import Video Clips into iMovie

If you have recorded the video clips with the use of a videocam, then connect the camera to the Mac and open the app. You can import the videos by manually selecting the clips that will be part of the YouTube video.

**Note:** If you want to import videos that you have already published on your YouTube channel, then you can download them from the channel, and save them as MP4\. However, if the videos were uploaded by other users, then you need to use a video converter, this article will let you know the [8 best video converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to convert video to MP4.

### Step 2: Edit the Video Clips

Once you have all the clips that you need, the next step is to edit YouTube videos in iMovie. When you import the clips, you have created an Event in the app. If you want to include a clip in your final video, just drag the file to the project browser, where you can edit the video.
