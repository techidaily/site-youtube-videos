## Enhance Privacy & Speed: The Best 7 Android AdBlocks

Developers make money by including ADS in their applications. They have two alternatives for customers who want to use their apps: either pay for such a lifetime purchase of the app or enjoy the free version that includes ADS. Best ad blocker for android helps eliminate ADS from apps installed on our Android devices.

Many people choose to use the free version since they can't afford to pay for a standard app, while some opt for Mods, but the best method to avoid ADS is to use programs that block them entirely. Although most of the best ad blockers for android applications listed below work on browsers, you may need to root your Android smartphone to utilize some of them.

Let's get started with this article's list of the best ad blocker for android applications, which will help you get rid of the annoying ads you encounter in apps regularly.

Click on the Content tab on the dashboard. Manage your content by editing or just reviewing the performance of each video. You can also create playlists linked to the videos to choose watch time.

#### **Step 4: Monitoring Channel Performance**

![youtube studio analytics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-creator-studio-unlocking-the-power-of-your-channel-5.JPG)

The YouTube Creator Studio Analytics provides a summary of your video metrics and reports. This will help you figure out what is working. The analytics also point out what needs to be improved to gain more views. Be sure to check views and watch time to get an accurate picture of the channelâ€™s performance.

#### **Step 5: Review Your Studio Monetization Tab**

![youtube studio earn](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/youtube-creator-studio-unlocking-the-power-of-your-channel-6.JPG)

The monetization tab shows the monetization status of your channel. On the left side of the dashboard, click Earn to access this feature. After being accepted to the YPP, you can make money from advertising revenue, merch shelf, channel membership, and the fan-funded program. Before monetization, this page shows how far you are to meet the eligibility criteria.

### **Importance of Verifying the YouTube Channel**

After uploading your videos to YouTube Creator Studio, you need to optimize each for monetization. This ensures that the algorithm works in your favor. It is also important to create an AdSense Account and link it to your channel. This will:

* Increase your level of credibility because a verified YouTube channel is seen as more trustworthy by viewers
* Protect you and your channel from impersonation by preventing other users from creating fake accounts under your name.
* Unlock additional features such as the ability to lie stream in HD and customer the channel layout.

Linking your AdSense to the Account is also a crucial step towards getting paid for your creation on YouTube. It ensures that your earnings get to you. After joining the YPP, you are allowed to change your linked AdSense account if you already have one. You can also monetize more than one channel using the same AdSense account, and keep track of your earnings.
