<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![import footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sourav-joshi-income-on-youtube-2022-7.jpg)

The first step is to click on “import” to access the folder where you can browse the video clips you need to edit.

##### Step2 Drag your Footage to Timeline

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![drag video to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sourav-joshi-income-on-youtube-2022-8.jpg)

Drag and drop your files from the media library to be used as the background in the first round. Then, drag and drop another video to be used on the top of that background in the second round.

##### Step3 Work on Speed and Duration Settings

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![speed and duration setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sourav-joshi-income-on-youtube-2022-9.jpg)

In the duration settings, you can adjust the video duration. If there’s need for adding more video clips together, repeat the same process on several tracks, sharing the same frame.

##### Step4 Fix Size and Positioning of your Video

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![fix size and positioning](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sourav-joshi-income-on-youtube-2022-10.jpg)
