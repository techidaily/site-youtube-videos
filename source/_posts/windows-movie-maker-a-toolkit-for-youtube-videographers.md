## Windows Movie Maker YouTube: How to Edit YouTube Videos?

Before editing the video in [Windows Movie Maker](https://windows-movie-maker-vista.en.softonic.com/download), you have to make sure that the video format is supported by free Windows Movie Maker. As you may know that Window Movie Maker only accept the following file formats at importing: **.WMV/.ASF, .MPG (MPEG-1), .AVI (DV-AVI), .WMA, .WAV, and .MP3\.** Importing formats such as   **MP4/3GP, FLV and MOV,** are also supported you are running Windows 7 or later and you have installed the necessary codec as well.

If your videos are not supported at importing in Windows Movie Maker, you may need to converter it first or choose a video editor like Filmora video editor which supports the almost all popular formats.

#### Step 1: Import Video Files Into Windows Movie Maker

![youtube movie maker import video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-clips-in-wmm.png)

To import video or photo into Windows Movie Maker, you can click on the button **Add Videos or Photos** located at the top of the program. A file window will open, and you can select the videos from any area of your computer. Once you have the files selected, click **OK** to import the files to the storyboard in the right hand panel.

#### Step 2: Trim/Cut/Split/Combine videos in Windows Movie Maker

Preview the video clips in the preview box. You can always use the Previous Frame or Next Frame to preview video frame by frame. When editing a video for YouTube, you may need to [trim to remove unwanted parts from the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [combine several clips into a new one](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or [split the video into several smaller parts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Click on **Title**, you can add text before the video begins; select **Caption**, you will write text to the video frames; and click **Credits** will add end credits to the end of the video.
