Other viewers will most likely comment on your videos when they are sure you will respond.

## Top 10 Most Watched YouTube Video in 24 Hours

Music videos get the most views in 24 hours YouTube because fans of these artists can repeatedly play the songs. Here are ten YouTube videos that had the most views in a day.

#### 1) Butter - BTS

With 108 million views in one day, Butter by BTS is undoubtedly the video with the most YouTube views in 24 hours. It is also the fastest YouTube video, as it reached 30 million views in 2 hours 20 minutes.

In the video, the superstar septet — Jin, Jimin, V, Jung Kook, J-Hope, Suga, and RM — appear in black-and-white, and they are wearing slick suits before it changes to color. They are rapping, singing, and dancing, with each one taking a turn to groove in an elevator. They also dance in a gymnasium and appear together on stage under pulsating lights.

#### 2) Dynamite - BTS

Released on August 21, 2020, Dynamite by BTS hit 101.1 million views in 24 hours. That makes it the second most watched YouTube video in 24 hours. This upbeat disco-pop track has soul and funk elements inspired by the Seventies and Eighties. And this theme echoes in the vintage-inspired outfits the members are wearing and the nostalgic settings in the music video.

In the background, viewers will see a warmly-lit record store and poster-studded bedroom that has tributes to The Beatles and David Bowie. The choreography includes shoutouts to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley and easy-to-follow freestyle dance moves that correspond well with the music.

#### 3) How You Like That - Blackpink

How You Like That is one of the videos that had the most views in 24 hours YouTube, as it managed to get 86.3 million views in 24 hours. In the beginning scene of the videos, the four artists sit like queens atop steps. They dance in several positions, including the Arctic, a trapezoidal hall, and a jungle.

The quartet is united in a dance break inside a grand domed hall at the end of this colorful music video. Here, the backup dancers surround the South Korean girl group.

#### 4) Ice Cream - Black Wink Ft Selena Gomez

Ice Cream by Blackpink and Selena Gomez is another video with the most YouTube views in 24 hours. It hit 79 million views on YouTube in 24 hours.

The video shows Blackpink and Gomes in several colorful outfits and sets. It starts with the scene of Gomez wearing a candy-striped bikini with a white sailor hat and gold hoop earrings; she is driving an ice cream truck packed with Serendipity Ice Cream. The members of Blackpink then appear and pop up smiling behind cardboard cutouts.

For the second post-chorus, the quartet appears in a pink ice cream parlor, and they are wearing black-and-white outfits and holding ice cream.

#### 5) BTS and Halsey’s Boy With Luv

Boy With Luv had hit 74.6 million views on YouTube within 24 hours of its release. When the music video was released in 2019, it became the fastest-viewed and liked YouTube video, reaching 3 million likes in just 2 hours.

The music video features brightly-hued scenes with retro-feeling looks from the Bangtan Boys. These include fedoras, feathered blazers, and bright pink smoking jackets. It also emphasizes the group's past through signage with phrases like Love and Persona.

#### 6) Lalisa - Lisa

Lalisa by the Thai singer and rapper Lisa reached 73.6 million views on YouTube the day of its release. The visual includes multiple costume changes, including a detailed ensemble inspired by traditional Thai culture. The musician is seen sitting on an elaborately-sculpted throne wearing a tall pointed headdress, a golden beaded dress with a cape, and ear cuffs with golden jasmine.

#### 7) Permission to Dance - BTS

This video had 72.3 million views on YouTube within 24 hours of release and became the 6th most watched YouTube video in 24 hours. Permission to Dance topped the charts in 5 countries, reaching the top ten in 10 other territories. In the video, BTS appears dancing in numerous settings. These include a patio, laundromat, and sunny locale.

#### 8) Life Goes on - BTS

This video was released on November 19, 2020, and it quickly gained 71.6 million views in 24 hours. Life Goes on by BTS became the fifth most watched YouTube video in 24 hours on its release. In the music video, members of the group appear to be lazing around their dorm. V then drives them around, and they later watch films and go to an empty stadium where they perform the song.

#### 9) Nain Bengali - Guru Randhawa

Nain Bengali is the first Indian music video to earn 71.4 million views on YouTube within 24 hours of its release. The music video shows Randhawa in a chick look. The artist experimented with a different look by dying his spike gray. Additionally, his confidence adds more elegance to his appearance. Guru also choreographed his moves in the video.

#### 10) Me! - Taylor Swift and Brendon Urie

When Me! was released on April 26, 2019, it amassed 65.2 million YouTube views in 24 hours and broke the record previously held by Thank U, Next by Ariana Grande. The video also surpassed Taylor's record set in 2017 with the music video Look What You Made Me Do.

The video is set in a chrysalis, and it opens with a scene of a snake slithering on a floor; it explodes into colorful butterflies to show the end of Taylor's previous era. The video pans up to Urie and Taylor engaging in an argument. Taylor is donning a beautiful black and white tule dress that has floral accents.

You make your original content, so it might not be obvious why you would want stock footage. Stock footage doesn’t replace your own recorded videos, though, it just supplements them by adding a bit of variety. Stock video footage is especially useful for things like intros and transitions.

Here are 4 YouTube channels where you can find free stock footage. To learn how to download videos directly from YouTube, check out the tutorial **[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

**Royalty-free Video Footage:**

[1\. Free Stock Footage Archive](#freestockfootage)

[2\. Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](#beachfront)

[3\. HDStockFootageFree](#hdstock)

[4\. NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](#natureclip)

## **1\. [Free Stock Footage Archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy8fgmCsEDIKMWx4Zi0CvNQ/featured)**

This channel has a massive library of free stock footage, which is updated semi-regularly. They have backgrounds, ‘glitch’ effects (which look really cool when combined with [Filmora’s green screen tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)), and more classic stock footage options like street scenes and forests. There’s a particularly interesting playlist of black and white videos, which could be useful if you’re trying to make a darker or creepier project.

Besides video footage, this archive also has some sound effects.

## **2\. [Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/Beachfrontprod/featured)**

This stock footage channel has lots of nature scenes and wildlife. There’s some urban and technology stuff too, but their nature stuff is especially great. It’s easy to find what you’re looking for on Beachfront B-Roll because they have themed playlists for different seasons, as well as for things like ‘sky’ or ‘water’.

On their **[website](http://www.beachfrontbroll.com/)**, you can find even more content and multiple download options.

## **3\. [HDStockFootageFree](https://www.youtube.com/user/HDStockFootageFree)**

This channel doesn’t have a large variety of different kinds of footage – all of it is pretty industrial. There’s footage of trains, trucks, trash, and people working. It’s the kind of stuff that you might not find on other stock footage channels because it’s not necessarily pretty.

## **4\. [NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/NatureClip)**

The name of this channel pretty much says it all. They’ve got tons of great nature videos, including scenery, animals, flowers, and views. It’s not all everyday nature either, they’ve got cool macro shots of bugs, and a lot of more exotic animals. One particularly noteworthy playlist is devoted entirely to slow-motion clips.

If you know of anywhere else, people can get free stock footage, say so in the comments!

If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software **Wondershare Filmora**. It provides special effects, stock photo & video, sound library, etc., which will definitely enhance your productivity and helps to make money by making videos much accessible.

Besides video footage, this archive also has some sound effects.

## **2\. [Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/Beachfrontprod/featured)**

This stock footage channel has lots of nature scenes and wildlife. There’s some urban and technology stuff too, but their nature stuff is especially great. It’s easy to find what you’re looking for on Beachfront B-Roll because they have themed playlists for different seasons, as well as for things like ‘sky’ or ‘water’.

On their **[website](http://www.beachfrontbroll.com/)**, you can find even more content and multiple download options.

## **3\. [HDStockFootageFree](https://www.youtube.com/user/HDStockFootageFree)**

This channel doesn’t have a large variety of different kinds of footage – all of it is pretty industrial. There’s footage of trains, trucks, trash, and people working. It’s the kind of stuff that you might not find on other stock footage channels because it’s not necessarily pretty.

## **4\. [NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/NatureClip)**

The name of this channel pretty much says it all. They’ve got tons of great nature videos, including scenery, animals, flowers, and views. It’s not all everyday nature either, they’ve got cool macro shots of bugs, and a lot of more exotic animals. One particularly noteworthy playlist is devoted entirely to slow-motion clips.

If you know of anywhere else, people can get free stock footage, say so in the comments!

If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software **Wondershare Filmora**. It provides special effects, stock photo & video, sound library, etc., which will definitely enhance your productivity and helps to make money by making videos much accessible.

You make your original content, so it might not be obvious why you would want stock footage. Stock footage doesn’t replace your own recorded videos, though, it just supplements them by adding a bit of variety. Stock video footage is especially useful for things like intros and transitions.

Here are 4 YouTube channels where you can find free stock footage. To learn how to download videos directly from YouTube, check out the tutorial **[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

**Royalty-free Video Footage:**

[1\. Free Stock Footage Archive](#freestockfootage)

[2\. Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](#beachfront)

[3\. HDStockFootageFree](#hdstock)

[4\. NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](#natureclip)

## **1\. [Free Stock Footage Archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy8fgmCsEDIKMWx4Zi0CvNQ/featured)**

This channel has a massive library of free stock footage, which is updated semi-regularly. They have backgrounds, ‘glitch’ effects (which look really cool when combined with [Filmora’s green screen tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)), and more classic stock footage options like street scenes and forests. There’s a particularly interesting playlist of black and white videos, which could be useful if you’re trying to make a darker or creepier project.

Besides video footage, this archive also has some sound effects.
