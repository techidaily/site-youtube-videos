## EditPrime Vision

Picsart is a platform that allows users to take photos and videos that they can then edit on the platform. Once the images or videos are edited to their satisfaction, users can then share them on each other’s social media pages.

It is one of the most popular media creation and editing apps with 1 billion uses around the world and it can be used on Android devices, iOS devices, and web browsers on PC. But Picsart is not a free solution and you may end up paying up to $48 a month to use the platform.

This is why we’ve searched for some of the most useful picsart alternatives that are completely free to use and work just as well.

## Picsart Photo and Video Editor

This app has more than 150 million downloads from users all over the world. It is available on the Google Play Store and offers numerous options to edit your photos and videos to create a more professional look and feel.

Some of the things that you can do using this app include creating collages, adding stickers, removing and even swapping backgrounds and so much more. You can edit existing images or use the built-in camera to take photos or record videos that you can then edit.

Here’s how you can use this app to edit your images or videos in numerous ways;

Step 1: Begin by installing the Picsart Photo and video editor on your Android device. To do that, just open the Google Play Store and search for the app and then install it.

Step 2: Open it after installation and tap on the “+” button to choose the video or photo that you would like to edit.

## Video Editor & Maker- Love Edit

Love-Edit is a mobile video editor that you can use to create professional videos that you can use for various purposes including marketing purposes. The tool has a simple user interface that can be used to make simple changes to a video such as cutting away sections of the video that you don’t want to include the video or even merging various clips to create a single video.

And since it is very easy to use, this tool can help you edit even the longest video in just a matter of minutes. But there are some users who complain that the app will begin lagging as soon as you start editing a video that is longer than 5 minutes.

Here’s how you can use this app to make changes to your videos;

Step 1: Start by installing the app on your device. Just go to the Google Play Store and search for the app. When you find it, tap “Install” to begin installing the app.

In much the same way, you can add filters and even add additional images to the video. Do not forget to save the video once you are done with the editing process.

## iPhone Picsart Photo & Video Editor

The Picsart Photo & Video Editor for iOS is another great tool that you can use to edit photos and videos on your iPhone. It can be used to make simple changes to the photo or video such as adding a simple filter, but it is also a useful solution when you want to make significant changes to the photos or video such as removing backgrounds and replacing them with other images.

One of the things we love about this app is that you can use it to add text to an existing image or video and you have over 200 designer fonts to choose from. it also has a lot of effects to choose from for both images and videos. For images, you can choose from a large library of stickers to add to the image and for videos, you can add photos, music, and even trim the videos to the desired length.

Here’s how you can use this app to edit a video in various ways;

Step 1: If you don’t already have the app installed on your device, go to the App Store, search for it and install it on your device. If you already have it, make sure that you are running the latest version before using it.

Step 2: When the installation is complete, open the app and then click on the “+” icon to import the video that you would like to edit into the app. You can choose a video from your Photos app or any other source on your device.

Step 3: If you would like to add a filter to the video, tap “Effects” and then choose the filter that you would like to use. To add an image to the video, tap “Images” and then select the image that you would like to add. Resize the image to fit the screen.

## Conclusion

There are very many apps that you can use to edit photos and videos on your device. But most of them can be quite expensive. The options above are easy to use, cost-effective, and have the necessary features to help you easily edit your images and videos.

There are quite a few different YouTube partnership agreements that you can go for, depending on your needs and preferences. For instance, a Fullscreen partnership agreement requires you to share a percentage of your revenue in exchange for access to Fullscreen’s partnership perks. These perks include customized thumbnails as well as channel banners.

### How to Get a Fullscreen Partnership

Now that we’ve covered what the partnership actually is, let’s go ahead and take a look at how to actually become a Fullscreen partner. There are a few things that you should take into account before deciding to go down this road. There are regulations that your account needs to abide by. Let’s take a look:

1. Your account cannot have any copyright strikes and must be in good standing.
2. Your channel needs to be at least 30 days old.
3. You must have at least 1,000 subscribers.
4. You need to have received at least 100 views per day for the last 30 days.

If you meet these requirements, and Fullscreen sounds like a good fit for you, go ahead and [apply for partnership](http://fullscreenmedia.co/apply/). The first thing that you need to do is go to the Fullscreen website and find the Channels page. Scroll to the lowest point and request more information. Click the button to trigger the appearance of a form and write a message to Fullscreen. Once you’ve sent your message, Fullscreen is going to take between 1 and 7 days to respond. If accepted, you will have to sign a contract and provide screenshots that confirm that your account is in good standing on the YouTube.

### How Fullscreen Pays You

You’ve entered into a partnership agreement – now you need to start getting paid. The process is simple.

Fullscreen will pay you through PayPal. They will calculate how much you’ve earned, and you will get that amount transferred to your account. Make sure to check the amount that you’ve earned from the dashboard of Fullscreen itself.

Becoming a Fullscreen partner might be a good idea for your channel if the perks appeal to you. However, think about your own skills and whether you are confident in your ability to keep on growing your channel yourself. Fullscreen provides you with a wide range of comprehensive marketing tools, but a lot of video creators are able to master YouTube marketing using the tools YouTube already provides. Before you agree to split profits with an MCN (in addition to the portion already claimed by YouTube), make sure you are really going to be earning more profits than you could alone.
