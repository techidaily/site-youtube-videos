If you want to use copyrighted music on YouTube lawfully, you'll need to go out and seek permission from the original creator. The second side of music licensing is this. Copyright law ensures that creators are compensated when their work is used, and this is where YouTube's music policy comes into play.

## How to upload your music to YouTube using Filmora?

At the end of the day, YouTube is a video-sharing site. Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn't commonplace, including a video can't hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you're working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.

The songs in YouTube's library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora's library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.

Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.

Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here's a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.

This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It's also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn't the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.

**Step 1:** The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio

Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to 'MEDIA' and then to the 'IMPORT' option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select 'Import Media Files' from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.

**Step 2:** Adding music to a timeline

Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the '+' sign ('Add to Project' will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.

**Step 3:** Make changes to the music file

By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.

**Step 4:** Export your work

After you've made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the 'EXPORT' tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.

#### Bouns! Where Can I Find Music For Youtube Videos?

YouTube's music library is relatively small. The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you're adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.

## Conclusion

‚óè We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you've ever wondered. On the surface, posting songs to YouTube may appear complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it'll be a snap. When considering how to promote your music, YouTube should not be disregarded. It's rare to have a free platform to distribute music on, so make use of it. With such a massive YouTube user base, your potential audience is enormous. Get your song on the platform and promote it as much as possible. You never know who might come upon your tunes until you've made them public. This concluded the tutorial on how to upload music to YouTube.

With a plethora of choices out there, marketers today are no longer taking the pitching kind of approach. They want to approach their audience with a value-based offer instead of sales. And with lifestyle videos, you can excel at giving customers a close-up look at your products and services.

#### 2\. Caters to Your Audience‚Äôs Interests

Lifestyle content caters to the target audience. Since these videos define your market and your brand, it carries a specific style that‚Äôs based on your aesthetics or looks. What makes video marketing so effective is that they can introduce your story and brand in an interesting way to potential customers.

#### 3\. Search Engine Optimization

Search engines love high-quality content like videos. Using lifestyle videos in your web pages and other types of content can thus work wonders for search engine optimization. As long as your lifestyle video is well-optimized with the right keywords, a solid title, and a good meta description, your video content can increase your web traffic.

#### 4\. Great Promotional Tool

Brands can distribute lifestyle content on different channels for reaching your target audience right away. Once you post the video on your website, you can share it on your social networking platforms or promote it with paid ads. This way, you can get customers excited about what you are offering them.

#### 5\. Taps into Emotions

Emotions are a significant component of the purchasing decision of consumers. Studies have found that ad campaigns with only emotional content perform about twice as well compared to those with only rational content. So, creating lifestyle video content that makes your audience feel good can put your business in a positive light.

#### 6\. Boosts Conversions

Lifestyle videos are excellent for conversions on websites as they influence visitors by promoting the lifestyle a customer can achieve if they patronize the product or service. What makes such content more compelling is that they excite customers about what you offer them.

## How to Create a Lifestyle Video?

The most stunning lifestyle videos are polished, sleek, and visually appealing. Developing a lifestyle video content that exceeds your target audience's expectations is vital to appeal to your customer‚Äôs perfect lifestyle. Creating these videos is easy if you follow the step-by-step guide.

#### Step 1: Pre-Production

The pre-production stage is when the planning happens for a video. From creative brainstorming to innovative storyboarding, everything happens here. Pre-production begins with experts getting a feel of your product, who it appeals to, and how it works. Next, is the stage of scripting out your video, writing down the visual ideas, and the product features and dialogue that go alongside it. Finally, you need to round up talents like actors, voice-actors, locations, and extras needed to film.

#### Step 2: Production

Once your lifestyle video is meticulously planned out, your next step is to film it. While shooting an average video takes eight hours, some videos with several locations can require two full shooting days or more. The exact shooting schedule depends on what the script demands.

Since these videos are meant to capture a particular way of life for appealing to a specific kind of person, you should not cut corners in terms of quality. Remember, the better the quality of the footage, the more appealing the end product will be.

#### Step 3: Post-Production

It is the stage where you need to gather the footage you have shot so far and put them along with voice-over or music depending on your script demands. The main goal in this stage is to put the visuals together in a captivating way to promote your service and product. Here, using a powerful video editing tool seems necessary because you need to make your lifestyle video stand out from the crowd.

#### Social Media

Lifestyle videos are aspirational, enlightening in nature, and made to appeal to specific demographics. It makes them great content for sharing on social networking platforms ‚Äì an active digital marketing channel. Share your lifestyle content across various social media accounts. Ensure you attach a call-to-action for your friends and followers to share.

#### Your Company‚Äôs Website

Hosting your promotional videos on your website, particularly your homepage is an excellent way to immediately introduce incoming web traffic to your products and services, thus increasing your site‚Äôs SEO ranking. Besides the homepage, sharing the video content on your blogs is another unique way of re-purposing your content.

#### Media Outlets

Find out related media outlets that your potential customers read and follow daily. It would help if you also pitched journalists who take an interest in your brand or consider purchasing advertising space on their website. Since there are both correct and incorrect ways to do so, ensure you conduct thorough research on how to pitch media outlets beforehand.

#### Paid Advertising

You can also pay for featuring your lifestyle video on popular blogs and social networking sites. This way, you can take advantage of hyper-specific tools for reaching your target audience. Advertising on social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn is an excellent way to reach the right demographic.

#### Niche Groups & Forums

When targeting a particular demographic, you will want to reach out to where your audience hangs out online. Do research on the industry chat rooms your target demographic frequently uses. While sharing your video content on these channels, just ensure that they are relevant to your potential customer-base, regularly updated, and also includes active users.

### Conclusion

Lifestyle videos allow brands to connect with their consumers better. Whether you are a start-up, an SME, or an established company, lifestyle videos may be just what you need to create a unique brand statement or get people excited about your product or service. So what are you still waiting for? It‚Äôs time to create content that resonates with your target market and establish your business as a top choice!
