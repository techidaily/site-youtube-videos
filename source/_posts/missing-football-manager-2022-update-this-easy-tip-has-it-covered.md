### Fix 2: Update your graphic driver

 Updating your graphics driver can fix the issue most of the time, and itâ€™s no harm to your PC but brings better performance.

You can update the graphics driver manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

Visit the website of your GPU manufacturer and search for your GPU model.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Choose the latest driver thatâ€™s compatible with your operating system. Then download and install it.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)
