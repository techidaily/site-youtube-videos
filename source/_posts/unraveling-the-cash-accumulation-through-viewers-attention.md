Can you make a living on YouTube? Everyone knows that big YouTubers get paid through the ads that play ahead of their videos. More and more YouTubers keep showing how much money they are making from YouTube via the lifestyles they lead. It begs the question - how much money do YouTubers make?

One of the main questions is "how many views do you need to start making money on YouTube?" The answer to this question is complicated. You need 4,000 hours of annual viewing time and 1,000 subscribers on your channel to sign up for monetization, but just being able to monetize your videos doesn’t mean you’re going to make money.

The reason is that YouTubers are not paid per view, they are paid per ad impression.

## Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?

If you ask YouTubers about how much they make per thousand views, you'll probably get a different answer depending on the person on who you ask. You may have already heard things like $5 per thousand views or $1,000 per 1 million views, but neither of these is for sure.

Google’s AdSense service, through which YouTubers make money, pays YouTubers for ad impressions. For most types of ads – including short pre-roll ads, the ads which appear at the bottoms of videos while they play, and the ads which appear as banners to the side of YouTube’s player – an ad impression means someone clicking on the ad and choosing to visit the advertiser’s site. One exception is skippable video ads, for which an impression is created when a viewer watches the ad for 30 seconds.

YouTubers do not make money on the views of their videos, because not all viewers click on ads. Many viewers bypass ads completely using ad-blockers. The amount of money YouTubers earn from a single ad impression is called their CPI or "cost per impression."

## CPI Rates Explained

YouTube advertising is currently managed inside the AdSense platform. In case you're not familiar with AdSense, you can have 2 different kinds of ads - the cost per click (CPC) or the cost per view (CPV).

#### Cost Per Click ads

The advertiser pays based on how many clicks he was able to get with that particular ad. These kinds of ads usually appear on the right side of your YouTube channel or they can also appear at the bottom of the screen, during the video.

#### Cost Per View ads

the advertiser will pay based on the views he had of the ad and not based on the clicks he was able to generate. One of the things that many people aren't aware of is the fact that the viewer needs to spend at least 30 seconds watching the ad or half the ad, whichever comes first. This means that a single viewer can continue clicking on the ad multiple times that the advertiser won't be billed for all those clicks because he is only paying for views.

#### Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos

If any of your friends ever suggest that they are going to do so to help you out tell them not to. AdSense has a rate of ad-clicks that it considers normal and if you get significantly more clicks than that it will think you’re artificially pushing that number up by either clicking yourself or having someone do it for you. If this happens they will ban you from AdSense and, although there is an appeals process, it is unlikely you will ever get your account back and be able to monetize videos again.

How much you make from an ad on YouTube depends on your CPI, cost per impression. Simply put, this is the rate that YouTube will pay you for every 1,000 views or clicks of the ads that are attached to your videos. Even though it would be a lot simpler if YouTube had their current CPI rates available, they don’t. These rates vary depending on the ad, the types of videos you make, and how popular your channel is. It is actually against YouTube’s rules for YouTubers to share their personal CPI rates publicly.

Most people tend to assume that CPI rates are between $0.05 and $10\. This huge difference is justified by YouTube by saying that they use a very complicated algorithm to determine your CPI rate. According to them, it includes evaluating factors like the ads, the type of audience who views your video, audience engagement, audience retention, and the price of the ads.

## How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?

Many people are aspiring to make money as famous YouTubers, but it is not an easy task. You have a long way to go before you start making any money at all.

In general, it’s reasonable to expect to start earning some money when you get to 1 million subscribers. This is the point at which you can start treating YouTube as your job, but the truth is that you will still not be making amazing money. At 1 million subscribers you will only be starting to be seen as someone important in your industry. You won’t even necessarily be "YouTube famous" yet – there are a lot of channels with 1 million subs.

Even though most people think that YouTube channels with 1 million subscribers are already making a good amount of money and that they are already at the top, the truth is that they’ve just started climbing. They aren't even near the top. Just to give you a better idea, there are more than 2,400 YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers.

According to Google, when an advertiser pays $100 to Google, Google pays $68 to the publisher (in this case, the publisher is a YouTube creator).

_This graphic won't apply to every situation because every situation is unique. It's just an example using assumed numbers._

#### How much money for 1,000 YouTube views?

15% of 1,000 is 150

150x CPI ($0.18) = $27\*

51% of $27 = $13

Using these rates, 1000 views are worth $13!

\*CPI vary

Assuming that the average rate is about $0.18 per impression, you still need to factor in that most people don't click on ads or watch skippable video ads for 30 seconds. Only about 15% of viewers tend to watch the complete ad (or, at least half of it). So, considering that you have 1,000 views on your video, only 150 viewers watched your complete ad. So, at $0.18 per view, Google will charge $27 to the advertiser and the YouTube channel will get 51% of that, meaning the creator will earn $13 per 1,000 views.

It will take you a long time to start earning enough money to support yourself through AdSense. That’s why AdSense isn’t the primary way that huge YouTube stars make money. In addition to AdSense revenue you can (and should) also consider other opportunities such as product placement, endorsements, and brand sponsorships. Many YouTubers also make some money from selling their merchandise.

Some YouTubers earn millions of dollars every year. Although the exact numbers have never been disclosed, many different websites have made educated guesses.

Forbes publishes an annual list of the highest-paid YouTubers, which includes revenue from things like book deals and makeup lines. It is useful to look at this list gain have some perspective about how big YouTubers make their money, and how big they had to get to make it.

As of 2017, YouTube gamer Daniel Middleton (DanTDM) is the highest-paid YouTuber earning 16 million dollars. He is followed by gamer Evan Fong (Vanoss Gaming) with $15.5 million, Dude Perfect with $14 million, and Mark Fischbach (Markiplier) and Logan Paul with $12.5 million. However, as we already mentioned, even though a substantial part of the income of these YouTube stars comes from YouTube/AdSense, the bulk of it comes from things like merchandise and sponsorships.

Instead of relying on YouTube to pay them, YouTubers need to seek out other ways of [leveraging the YouTube platform to earn money](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

We all agree that being a YouTube star isn't an easy path. However, if you honestly love what you do, then you will be willing to put effort into making great videos regularly. Part of that is also being willing to take the time to promote them and yourself, as well as putting time and effort into forging a good relationship with your audience.

## Why No Longer 10,000 Views?

YouTube used to let anybody monetize their videos, but that has now changed. Then for a while, you'll qualify for monetization after reaching 10,000-lifetime views on your channel. But as of 2018, the rules to YouTube monetization has gotten more challenging.

To monetize you must have:

\- 4,000 of annual watch time

\- 1,000 subscribers

The reason for this is that YouTube was having trouble with channels that were trying to monetize stolen or inappropriate content, besides, YouTubers are gaming the system by using automated programs to gain more views. By making creators get more watch time and subscribers before they apply for monetization, YouTube has been able to create a review process in which they can prove that the channel has a legitimate audience and stop content thieves and criminals from making money. Naturally, this new rule also makes it very difficult for new YouTubers to make money.

## Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?

If you ask YouTubers about how much they make per thousand views, you'll probably get a different answer depending on the person on who you ask. You may have already heard things like $5 per thousand views or $1,000 per 1 million views, but neither of these is for sure.

Google’s AdSense service, through which YouTubers make money, pays YouTubers for ad impressions. For most types of ads – including short pre-roll ads, the ads which appear at the bottoms of videos while they play, and the ads which appear as banners to the side of YouTube’s player – an ad impression means someone clicking on the ad and choosing to visit the advertiser’s site. One exception is skippable video ads, for which an impression is created when a viewer watches the ad for 30 seconds.

YouTubers do not make money on the views of their videos, because not all viewers click on ads. Many viewers bypass ads completely using ad-blockers. The amount of money YouTubers earn from a single ad impression is called their CPI or "cost per impression."

## CPI Rates Explained

YouTube advertising is currently managed inside the AdSense platform. In case you're not familiar with AdSense, you can have 2 different kinds of ads - the cost per click (CPC) or the cost per view (CPV).

#### Cost Per Click ads

The advertiser pays based on how many clicks he was able to get with that particular ad. These kinds of ads usually appear on the right side of your YouTube channel or they can also appear at the bottom of the screen, during the video.

#### Cost Per View ads

the advertiser will pay based on the views he had of the ad and not based on the clicks he was able to generate. One of the things that many people aren't aware of is the fact that the viewer needs to spend at least 30 seconds watching the ad or half the ad, whichever comes first. This means that a single viewer can continue clicking on the ad multiple times that the advertiser won't be billed for all those clicks because he is only paying for views.

#### Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos

If any of your friends ever suggest that they are going to do so to help you out tell them not to. AdSense has a rate of ad-clicks that it considers normal and if you get significantly more clicks than that it will think you’re artificially pushing that number up by either clicking yourself or having someone do it for you. If this happens they will ban you from AdSense and, although there is an appeals process, it is unlikely you will ever get your account back and be able to monetize videos again.

How much you make from an ad on YouTube depends on your CPI, cost per impression. Simply put, this is the rate that YouTube will pay you for every 1,000 views or clicks of the ads that are attached to your videos. Even though it would be a lot simpler if YouTube had their current CPI rates available, they don’t. These rates vary depending on the ad, the types of videos you make, and how popular your channel is. It is actually against YouTube’s rules for YouTubers to share their personal CPI rates publicly.

Most people tend to assume that CPI rates are between $0.05 and $10\. This huge difference is justified by YouTube by saying that they use a very complicated algorithm to determine your CPI rate. According to them, it includes evaluating factors like the ads, the type of audience who views your video, audience engagement, audience retention, and the price of the ads.

## How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?

Many people are aspiring to make money as famous YouTubers, but it is not an easy task. You have a long way to go before you start making any money at all.

In general, it’s reasonable to expect to start earning some money when you get to 1 million subscribers. This is the point at which you can start treating YouTube as your job, but the truth is that you will still not be making amazing money. At 1 million subscribers you will only be starting to be seen as someone important in your industry. You won’t even necessarily be "YouTube famous" yet – there are a lot of channels with 1 million subs.

Even though most people think that YouTube channels with 1 million subscribers are already making a good amount of money and that they are already at the top, the truth is that they’ve just started climbing. They aren't even near the top. Just to give you a better idea, there are more than 2,400 YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers.

According to Google, when an advertiser pays $100 to Google, Google pays $68 to the publisher (in this case, the publisher is a YouTube creator).

![How Much Do YouTuber Makes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-much-do-youtubers-make.png)

_This graphic won't apply to every situation because every situation is unique. It's just an example using assumed numbers._

#### How much money for 1,000 YouTube views?

15% of 1,000 is 150

150x CPI ($0.18) = $27\*

51% of $27 = $13

Using these rates, 1000 views are worth $13!

\*CPI vary

Assuming that the average rate is about $0.18 per impression, you still need to factor in that most people don't click on ads or watch skippable video ads for 30 seconds. Only about 15% of viewers tend to watch the complete ad (or, at least half of it). So, considering that you have 1,000 views on your video, only 150 viewers watched your complete ad. So, at $0.18 per view, Google will charge $27 to the advertiser and the YouTube channel will get 51% of that, meaning the creator will earn $13 per 1,000 views.

It will take you a long time to start earning enough money to support yourself through AdSense. That’s why AdSense isn’t the primary way that huge YouTube stars make money. In addition to AdSense revenue you can (and should) also consider other opportunities such as product placement, endorsements, and brand sponsorships. Many YouTubers also make some money from selling their merchandise.

Some YouTubers earn millions of dollars every year. Although the exact numbers have never been disclosed, many different websites have made educated guesses.

Forbes publishes an annual list of the highest-paid YouTubers, which includes revenue from things like book deals and makeup lines. It is useful to look at this list gain have some perspective about how big YouTubers make their money, and how big they had to get to make it.

As of 2017, YouTube gamer Daniel Middleton (DanTDM) is the highest-paid YouTuber earning 16 million dollars. He is followed by gamer Evan Fong (Vanoss Gaming) with $15.5 million, Dude Perfect with $14 million, and Mark Fischbach (Markiplier) and Logan Paul with $12.5 million. However, as we already mentioned, even though a substantial part of the income of these YouTube stars comes from YouTube/AdSense, the bulk of it comes from things like merchandise and sponsorships.

Instead of relying on YouTube to pay them, YouTubers need to seek out other ways of [leveraging the YouTube platform to earn money](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

We all agree that being a YouTube star isn't an easy path. However, if you honestly love what you do, then you will be willing to put effort into making great videos regularly. Part of that is also being willing to take the time to promote them and yourself, as well as putting time and effort into forging a good relationship with your audience.

## Why No Longer 10,000 Views?

YouTube used to let anybody monetize their videos, but that has now changed. Then for a while, you'll qualify for monetization after reaching 10,000-lifetime views on your channel. But as of 2018, the rules to YouTube monetization has gotten more challenging.

To monetize you must have:

\- 4,000 of annual watch time

\- 1,000 subscribers

The reason for this is that YouTube was having trouble with channels that were trying to monetize stolen or inappropriate content, besides, YouTubers are gaming the system by using automated programs to gain more views. By making creators get more watch time and subscribers before they apply for monetization, YouTube has been able to create a review process in which they can prove that the channel has a legitimate audience and stop content thieves and criminals from making money. Naturally, this new rule also makes it very difficult for new YouTubers to make money.

The El Rubius OMG channel was created by Rubén Doblas Gundersen in December 2011 and by February 2013 it reached 1 million subscribers. However, Rubén has been producing videos for his Elrubius channel since 2006\. He simply became more dedicated to the frequent production of YouTube videos in 2011\. Even though the videos featured on the El Rubius OMG channel mostly cover video games, Rubén also produces comedy videos, vlogs, and other interesting and amusing content.

Based in Madrid, El Rubius OMG first became popular in Spanish-speaking countries, and as his fame increased he gained recognition throughout the world. During 2012 his channel became the most subscribed Spanish speaking channel, and on April 21, 2016, El Rubius received the 'YouTuber of the Year' award during the 1st Play Awards celebration in Palma De Mallorca. In addition to being one of the most popular YouTubers of all time, Rubén is also a published author whose first book 'The Troll Book' was the bestselling book in Spain for 8 weeks.

###  4\.  Smosh

![Smosh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smosh.jpg)

Originally, Smosh was a channel run by sketch comedy duo Ian Andrew Hecox and Anthony Padilla. They started the Smosh YouTube channel in 2005 and since then they have grown their team to include more creators, and their content to include animation and gaming. Smosh has become much more than two funny guys on YouTube – it is a wildly successful content company.

Most channels that have one viral video do not go on to have sustained success on YouTube, but Smosh is an exception to this rule. Their ‘Pokemon Theme Music Video’, released in 2005, became the most viewed video of all time (as of that year). This video kick-started the growth of their channel.

In 2017, Anthony Padilla chose to leave Smosh to focus on his own solo YouTube channel.

### 5\.  Fernanfloo

![Fernanfloo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fernan-floo.jpg)

Yet another enormously popular YouTuber that comes from a Spanish speaking country whose channel attracted millions of subscribers. A 24-year-old Salvadoran named Luis Fernando Flores Alvarado is the man behind one of the most subscribed YouTube channels of all time. The Fernanfloo channel was created in 2011, and in February 2014 it had only 100,000 subscribers. By August 2014, Alvarado's channel reached 1 million subscribers, making him one of YouTube's biggest success stories. The videos featured on Feranfloo channel mostly cover gaming topics, but with a touch of comedy which makes Alvarado's videos unique.

At the end of 2015, Alvarado launched the Fenanfloo mobile app that had 2.3 million downloads in the first week. His videos are mostly in Spanish which somewhat limits his audience, but it is safe to say the Fernanfloo channel is among the most popular channels in the Latin American countries since most of his audience comes from Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.

 _As of November 2017_

 YouTube is changing the world as we know it because now the only thing you need to start sharing things you care about with a huge audience is a YouTube channel. One-third of all internet usage is on YouTube, which means that your videos can get more viewers than the content broadcasted on some television networks.

Aside from the official channels of pop stars such as Justin Bieber or Katy Perry, the most subscribed channels on YouTube feature comedy and gaming videos (want to be a YouTube gamer?). There is an audience for every type of video on YouTube and there are channels on everything from cooking to music doing extremely well, but comedy and gaming are the larges genres.

In this article, we will take you through the 5 most popular creator channels on YouTube today, and show you what they have in common.

Felix created his YouTube channel in 2010 and in only six short years the PewDiePie YouTube channel received over 16 billion views and it is currently among the most viewed channels ever.

The most common videos on Felix's channel are gaming videos in which he comments and reacts to the game as he plays through it. PewDiePie’s videos are full of goofy and genuine content that amuses its spectators. Felix's YouTube channel remains by far the most subscribed channel with more than 57 million subscribers, more than 25 million more than the channel in second. He frequently appears in marketing campaigns and other social media events and is widely considered as the most influential gaming commentator of our time.

The Chilean YouTube superstar uploaded his first YouTube video in 2011 and by October 2012 his channel has reached 1 million subscribers. Recently, German has lent his voice to a character in the Spanish version of Ice Age: Collision Course. He finds inspiration for his comic YouTube videos in everyday life and topics like ex-girlfriends, school, and phobias are frequently covered in videos published on the HolaSoyGerman channel.
