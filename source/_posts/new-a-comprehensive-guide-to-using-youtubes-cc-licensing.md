[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) is a non-profit organization internationally active in providing free licenses that creators can use in order to make their work available to the public. With the creative commons (CC) licenses, the creator has basically given others permission in order to use their work but under specific conditions.

Whenever a work is created, an article or a photograph was taken, there is a copyright that protects it so that it cannot be used in certain ways. On the other hand, the CC licenses allow the creator to choose how they would want others to use their creativity.

## Part 1: What is YouTube Creative Commons

[YouTube utilizes CC licenses](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797468?hl=en) in its content. With it, the content creators can grant others to use their work as sort of a standard. YouTube users can use the Creative Commons CC BY license in marking their videos. When they use the CC By license, the system will generate a signature to the video automatically. This indicates that you are using Creative Commons content and will show the source video’s titles below the video player. The creator retains the [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) of the video while others can reuse your video but under the terms of the license.

If you are looking for Creative Commons licensed videos, there are different ways or rather, different websites you can go to. These websites are the best place you can find CC-licensed videos and ensure that what you are sharing is legal.

* **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/?gl=US)**– YouTube is one of the most common websites you can find CC licensed videos. The easy way to search for CC licensed videos on YouTube is simply to search 'creative commons' to the end of the search term you are going for.

## Part 3: Can You Download Creative Commons-licensed YouTube videos to Edit

Many people are asking that can I edit creative commons videos? Well, this is a tricky question because it really depends on what creative commons license is used. If the video is CC-BY, it is no doubt that you can download and edit it. CC-BY-SA means you can edit video under the condition of you also allow others to edit it after you upload it to YouTube. If it is non-commercial, you are definitely not allowed to edit it.
