<p> Creating a YouTube channel and uploading video content is only one part of the key to your success. With so much competition on the platform, it’s crucial that you stand out from the crowd with efficient, professional videos that are a pleasure to watch.</p>
<p> Without some planning and structure in mind before you begin filming, it’s all too easy to get a bit lost and start to ramble or fumble your words. Video’s filled with ‘umm’ and ‘err’ are neither pleasant to watch nor engaging.</p>
<p> If you’re serious about making a great YouTube channel and developing a loyal fan base, you’re going to need a workable structure for every video to help you stay on track. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Why is structuring your video important?</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">How should you structure YouTube Video Content?</a></li>
<li><a href="#part3">Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li>
<li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li>
<li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li>
</ul>
<p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p>
<h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p>
<h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p>
<p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p>
<h3 id="Main-content"><a href="#Main-content" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p>
<p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p>
<h3 id="Hook"><a href="#Hook" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p>
<p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p>
<h3 id="Outro"><a href="#Outro" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals. This is the point at which you can ask something back from your audience, whatever that may be. We call this a ‘call to action’, and it could eb something as simple as subscribing through to something more involved like visiting your website.</p>
<p> Think about what you want from your audience; what should they do next? Remember to ask via a strong call to action, otherwise you’ve simply given them some free advice with very little in the way of a return for you.</p>
<h3 id="Script-or-no-script"><a href="#Script-or-no-script" class="headerlink" title="Script or no script?"></a>Script or no script?</h3><p> Many YouTubers shy away from using any sort of script, feeling that this will make them less relatable and natural. Choosing whether or not to script is entirely up to you; some people feel more comfortable with a script to hand, whereas others prefer to just wing it as they go.</p>
<p> If you don’t feel a script would work for you, do consider having a very rough outline of your structure and the points you want to make readily available while filming. It will help you regain control if you do happen to lose your place and will ensure you get all the information across that you’d planned to.</p>
<p> If you do think a full script would work better for you, make sure you are able to come across as naturally as possible while reading it. Write your script the same way you speak and run through a few times so you’re not squinting at words while you’re on camera. If you regularly wander off script, this could be a sign that a freer flowing style is more your thing.</p>

<h2 id="Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos"><a href="#Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos" class="headerlink" title="Ready to go out and make amazing videos?"></a>Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</h2><p> Having a structure to your videos might seem a little unnatural at first, but there’s plenty of evidence to show that people who take the time to plan their content get far better results than those who just improvise. If you’re unsure of the best structure for your content, watch videos made by others in your niche to see how they organize theirs.</p>
<p> That’s not to say you have to copy the leaders to be a success; indeed, you’ll be far more successful on YouTube if you continue to be unique. But there’s always room to learn from the best and to take inspiration from those who’ve been getting the very best results.</p>

<p> Creating a YouTube channel and uploading video content is only one part of the key to your success. With so much competition on the platform, it’s crucial that you stand out from the crowd with efficient, professional videos that are a pleasure to watch.</p>
<p> Without some planning and structure in mind before you begin filming, it’s all too easy to get a bit lost and start to ramble or fumble your words. Video’s filled with ‘umm’ and ‘err’ are neither pleasant to watch nor engaging.</p>
<p> If you’re serious about making a great YouTube channel and developing a loyal fan base, you’re going to need a workable structure for every video to help you stay on track. Here’s what you need to know:</p>

<h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important-2"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important-2" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li>
<li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li>
<li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li>
</ul>
<p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p>
<h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content-2"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content-2" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p>
<h3 id="Intro-2"><a href="#Intro-2" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p>
<p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p>
<h3 id="Main-content-2"><a href="#Main-content-2" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p>
<p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p>
<h3 id="Hook-2"><a href="#Hook-2" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p>
<p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p>
<h3 id="Outro-2"><a href="#Outro-2" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals. This is the point at which you can ask something back from your audience, whatever that may be. We call this a ‘call to action’, and it could eb something as simple as subscribing through to something more involved like visiting your website.</p>
<p> Think about what you want from your audience; what should they do next? Remember to ask via a strong call to action, otherwise you’ve simply given them some free advice with very little in the way of a return for you.</p>
<h3 id="Script-or-no-script-2"><a href="#Script-or-no-script-2" class="headerlink" title="Script or no script?"></a>Script or no script?</h3><p> Many YouTubers shy away from using any sort of script, feeling that this will make them less relatable and natural. Choosing whether or not to script is entirely up to you; some people feel more comfortable with a script to hand, whereas others prefer to just wing it as they go.</p>
<p> If you don’t feel a script would work for you, do consider having a very rough outline of your structure and the points you want to make readily available while filming. It will help you regain control if you do happen to lose your place and will ensure you get all the information across that you’d planned to.</p>
<p> If you do think a full script would work better for you, make sure you are able to come across as naturally as possible while reading it. Write your script the same way you speak and run through a few times so you’re not squinting at words while you’re on camera. If you regularly wander off script, this could be a sign that a freer flowing style is more your thing.</p>

<h2 id="Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos-2"><a href="#Ready-to-go-out-and-make-amazing-videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Ready to go out and make amazing videos?"></a>Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</h2><p> Having a structure to your videos might seem a little unnatural at first, but there’s plenty of evidence to show that people who take the time to plan their content get far better results than those who just improvise. If you’re unsure of the best structure for your content, watch videos made by others in your niche to see how they organize theirs.</p>
<p> That’s not to say you have to copy the leaders to be a success; indeed, you’ll be far more successful on YouTube if you continue to be unique. But there’s always room to learn from the best and to take inspiration from those who’ve been getting the very best results.</p>

<p>Looking for a quality <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? There are 2 things that make for good YouTube content: quality pictures and quality audio. If you are an ambitious YouTuber, you cannot afford to compromise on either of these. In fact, many would argue that having good audio is far more important than having good visuals, the reason being that poor audio is sure to discourage people from viewing your video no matter how great the pictures are.</p>
<p>This is why it’s important to invest in a good microphone for your YouTube videos. The best microphone for you will depend on the kind of videos you make and also where you do your recording. In this post, we tell you the top 19 microphones for making YouTube videos and we’ve grouped our top picks based on the type and setting of the video.</p>

<h2 id="The-Top-3-Condenser-Microphones-for-Singing-and-Music"><a href="#The-Top-3-Condenser-Microphones-for-Singing-and-Music" class="headerlink" title="The Top 3 Condenser Microphones for Singing and Music"></a>The Top 3 Condenser Microphones for Singing and Music</h2><p>Recording music requires a microphone that can pick up the nuances and depths of all the sounds involved in a performance. This is why microphones with large diaphragms, noise cancellation, and the capacity for high-pressure sound recording are ideal. Here are our top 3 microphones for singing and recording music.</p>
<h4 id="1-Audio-Technica-AT2035"><a href="#1-Audio-Technica-AT2035" class="headerlink" title="1. Audio-Technica AT2035"></a>1. Audio-Technica AT2035</h4><p>The Audio-Technica AT2035 is a versatile condenser microphone that delivers excellent sound quality. It boasts a big diaphragm that enables it to pick up direct frontal sound very well and can also handle high-pressure sounds. According to some reviewers, this mic may pick up background noise if used in an environment that isn’t soundproof. That said, experienced vocalists and musicians are very pleased with the quality and warmth of the sound captured by this mic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Rode-NT1-A"><a href="#2-Rode-NT1-A" class="headerlink" title="2. Rode NT1-A"></a>2. Rode NT1-A</h4><p>The Rode NT1-A is a top-performing condenser mic that delivers the kind of professional sound quality YouTube vocalists and instrumentalists want from their studio recordings. Its great sound quality, low self-noise, and extended dynamic range make it remarkable for microphones in its class. It also comes with advanced features and its own Phantom power pack. Though priced higher than similar microphones, many YouTubers would agree that the quality delivered by the Rode NT1-A is well worth the additional cost.</p>
<h4 id="3-AKG-C214"><a href="#3-AKG-C214" class="headerlink" title="3. AKG C214"></a>3. AKG C214</h4><p>The AKG C214 is by far the best studio-quality condenser microphone on this list. It is equipped with a large diaphragm for faultless sound fidelity and depth. It also has a bass filter and an attenuation pad that work together to capture loud and up-close bass sounds without audio artifacts. This mic is great for recording vocals as well as instruments and is famous for its durable build and consistent top-quality performance. The AKG C214 microphone is a great option for YouTube performing artists who are ready to up their game and produce content of impeccable quality.</p>
<h2 id="The-Top-6-Condenser-Microphones-For-Podcasts-Interviews-and-Voiceovers"><a href="#The-Top-6-Condenser-Microphones-For-Podcasts-Interviews-and-Voiceovers" class="headerlink" title="The Top 6 Condenser Microphones For Podcasts, Interviews, and Voiceovers"></a>The Top 6 Condenser Microphones For Podcasts, Interviews, and Voiceovers</h2><p>Podcasts, interviews, and voiceovers are often shot in offices that double as studios. Usually, the podcaster and interviewees are seated at a desk in front of or next to a computer and may in fact be recording using a webcam. Here are 6 microphone options that give you the flexibility and connectivity you need for podcasts, voiceovers, and interviews.</p>
<h4 id="1-Apogee-Mic-96K"><a href="#1-Apogee-Mic-96K" class="headerlink" title="1. Apogee Mic 96K"></a>1. Apogee Mic 96K</h4><p>The Apogee Mic 96K is a plug-n-play cardioid USB mic that’s great for recording unidirectional sound like the human voice. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac (although it was primarily designed for Mac) and is perfect for recording simple voiceover videos and weekly podcasts. It’s also quite flexible and can be connected to mobile devices and cameras for both indoor studios and outdoor use.</p>
<h4 id="2-Blue-Yeti"><a href="#2-Blue-Yeti" class="headerlink" title="2. Blue Yeti"></a>2. Blue Yeti</h4><p>The Blue Yeti is a popular USB condenser mic among YouTubers and podcasters. It delivers great sound quality in its cardioid mode (cardioid means it only records sound from in front of itself) and can be switched into other 3 other polar patterns thanks to its 3 in-build condenser capsules. This means that the Blue Yeti can be configured for bidirectional, stereo, and omnidirectional sound. This mic also comes at a relatively affordable price and is compatible with Windows and Mac. While most reviewers would not recommend it for recording studio music, it delivers the desired sound quality and range for YouTubers who focus on voiceover recordings and interviews.</p>
<h4 id="3-Rode-NT-USB"><a href="#3-Rode-NT-USB" class="headerlink" title="3. Rode NT-USB"></a>3. Rode NT-USB</h4><p>The Rode NT-USB is a great plug-n-play mic that comes with useful supporting equipment including a tripod mount and a storage pouch as well as a USB cable. It also has other desirable features like a 3.5mm headphone jack and on-mic mix control. That said, it lacks the voice configuration versatility of the Blue Yeti and is relatively more expensive. That said, this is one microphone that will impress fans of the Rode brand.</p>
<h4 id="4-Blue-Snowball"><a href="#4-Blue-Snowball" class="headerlink" title="4. Blue Snowball"></a>4. Blue Snowball</h4><p>The Blue Snowball is a cool USB microphone that’s perfect for YouTubers on a budget. It has 2 sound recording configurations and will do a good job of capturing voiceover recording, podcasts, and interviews. The Blue Snowball is however very low on additional features and perhaps this is why it’s so much more affordable than the Blue Yeti. Depending on the Snowball model you buy, you may get no configuration options, no headphone jack, and no stand. All in all, this is a great starter-mic for voiceover YouTubers who are new to the game.</p>
<h4 id="5-Audio-Technica-AT2020"><a href="#5-Audio-Technica-AT2020" class="headerlink" title="5. Audio-Technica AT2020"></a>5. Audio-Technica AT2020</h4><p>The Audio-Technica AT2020 is a solid USB mic that’s especially good for voiceover recordings and one-person podcasts. It is built with only a cardioid unidirectional setting and may not deliver the best sound quality in a video involving more than 2 people. Its newer model also has additional functional options like a headphone jack and mix dial which was not available on the older model. That said, it may cost less than a Blue Yeti for most shoppers and delivers enough functionality and sound quality for the average YouTube voiceover recording.</p>
<h4 id="6-Rode-Procaster"><a href="#6-Rode-Procaster" class="headerlink" title="6. Rode Procaster"></a>6. Rode Procaster</h4><p>The Rode Procaster is a great cardioid microphone for voiceover recordings and podcasts. It is known to perform well when placed close to the speaker and comes with an internal shock mount to reduce vibrations in voiceover recordings. While it performs quite well for a cardioid mic, it may need additional devices to achieve better sound gain and an external shock mount to better resist vibrations.</p>

<p>Looking for a quality <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? There are 2 things that make for good YouTube content: quality pictures and quality audio. If you are an ambitious YouTuber, you cannot afford to compromise on either of these. In fact, many would argue that having good audio is far more important than having good visuals, the reason being that poor audio is sure to discourage people from viewing your video no matter how great the pictures are.</p>
<p>This is why it’s important to invest in a good microphone for your YouTube videos. The best microphone for you will depend on the kind of videos you make and also where you do your recording. In this post, we tell you the top 19 microphones for making YouTube videos and we’ve grouped our top picks based on the type and setting of the video.</p>

This is why microphones with large diaphragms, noise cancellation, and the capacity for high-pressure sound recording are ideal. Here are our top 3 microphones for singing and recording music.</p>
<h4 id="1-Audio-Technica-AT2035-1"><a href="#1-Audio-Technica-AT2035-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Audio-Technica AT2035"></a>1. Audio-Technica AT2035</h4><p>The Audio-Technica AT2035 is a versatile condenser microphone that delivers excellent sound quality. It boasts a big diaphragm that enables it to pick up direct frontal sound very well and can also handle high-pressure sounds. According to some reviewers, this mic may pick up background noise if used in an environment that isn’t soundproof. That said, experienced vocalists and musicians are very pleased with the quality and warmth of the sound captured by this mic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Rode-NT1-A-1"><a href="#2-Rode-NT1-A-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Rode NT1-A"></a>2. Rode NT1-A</h4><p>The Rode NT1-A is a top-performing condenser mic that delivers the kind of professional sound quality YouTube vocalists and instrumentalists want from their studio recordings. Its great sound quality, low self-noise, and extended dynamic range make it remarkable for microphones in its class. It also comes with advanced features and its own Phantom power pack. Though priced higher than similar microphones, many YouTubers would agree that the quality delivered by the Rode NT1-A is well worth the additional cost.</p>
<h4 id="3-AKG-C214-1"><a href="#3-AKG-C214-1" class="headerlink" title="3. AKG C214"></a>3. AKG C214</h4><p>The AKG C214 is by far the best studio-quality condenser microphone on this list. It is equipped with a large diaphragm for faultless sound fidelity and depth. It also has a bass filter and an attenuation pad that work together to capture loud and up-close bass sounds without audio artifacts. This mic is great for recording vocals as well as instruments and is famous for its durable build and consistent top-quality performance. The AKG C214 microphone is a great option for YouTube performing artists who are ready to up their game and produce content of impeccable quality.</p>
<h2 id="The-Top-6-Condenser-Microphones-For-Podcasts-Interviews-and-Voiceovers-1"><a href="#The-Top-6-Condenser-Microphones-For-Podcasts-Interviews-and-Voiceovers-1" class="headerlink" title="The Top 6 Condenser Microphones For Podcasts, Interviews, and Voiceovers"></a>The Top 6 Condenser Microphones For Podcasts, Interviews, and Voiceovers</h2><p>Podcasts, interviews, and voiceovers are often shot in offices that double as studios. Usually, the podcaster and interviewees are seated at a desk in front of or next to a computer and may in fact be recording using a webcam. Here are 6 microphone options that give you the flexibility and connectivity you need for podcasts, voiceovers, and interviews.</p>
<h4 id="1-Apogee-Mic-96K-1"><a href="#1-Apogee-Mic-96K-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Apogee Mic 96K"></a>1. Apogee Mic 96K</h4><p>The Apogee Mic 96K is a plug-n-play cardioid USB mic that’s great for recording unidirectional sound like the human voice. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac (although it was primarily designed for Mac) and is perfect for recording simple voiceover videos and weekly podcasts. It’s also quite flexible and can be connected to mobile devices and cameras for both indoor studios and outdoor use.</p>
<h4 id="2-Blue-Yeti-1"><a href="#2-Blue-Yeti-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Blue Yeti"></a>2. Blue Yeti</h4><p>The Blue Yeti is a popular USB condenser mic among YouTubers and podcasters. It delivers great sound quality in its cardioid mode (cardioid means it only records sound from in front of itself) and can be switched into other 3 other polar patterns thanks to its 3 in-build condenser capsules. This means that the Blue Yeti can be configured for bidirectional, stereo, and omnidirectional sound. This mic also comes at a relatively affordable price and is compatible with Windows and Mac. While most reviewers would not recommend it for recording studio music, it delivers the desired sound quality and range for YouTubers who focus on voiceover recordings and interviews.</p>
<h4 id="3-Rode-NT-USB-1"><a href="#3-Rode-NT-USB-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Rode NT-USB"></a>3. Rode NT-USB</h4><p>The Rode NT-USB is a great plug-n-play mic that comes with useful supporting equipment including a tripod mount and a storage pouch as well as a USB cable. It also has other desirable features like a 3.5mm headphone jack and on-mic mix control. That said, it lacks the voice configuration versatility of the Blue Yeti and is relatively more expensive. That said, this is one microphone that will impress fans of the Rode brand.</p>
<h4 id="4-Blue-Snowball-1"><a href="#4-Blue-Snowball-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Blue Snowball"></a>4. Blue Snowball</h4><p>The Blue Snowball is a cool USB microphone that’s perfect for YouTubers on a budget. It has 2 sound recording configurations and will do a good job of capturing voiceover recording, podcasts, and interviews. The Blue Snowball is however very low on additional features and perhaps this is why it’s so much more affordable than the Blue Yeti. Depending on the Snowball model you buy, you may get no configuration options, no headphone jack, and no stand. All in all, this is a great starter-mic for voiceover YouTubers who are new to the game.</p>
<h4 id="5-Audio-Technica-AT2020-1"><a href="#5-Audio-Technica-AT2020-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Audio-Technica AT2020"></a>5. Audio-Technica AT2020</h4><p>The Audio-Technica AT2020 is a solid USB mic that’s especially good for voiceover recordings and one-person podcasts. It is built with only a cardioid unidirectional setting and may not deliver the best sound quality in a video involving more than 2 people. Its newer model also has additional functional options like a headphone jack and mix dial which was not available on the older model. That said, it may cost less than a Blue Yeti for most shoppers and delivers enough functionality and sound quality for the average YouTube voiceover recording.</p>
<h4 id="6-Rode-Procaster-1"><a href="#6-Rode-Procaster-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Rode Procaster"></a>6. Rode Procaster</h4><p>The Rode Procaster is a great cardioid microphone for voiceover recordings and podcasts.

While it performs quite well for a cardioid mic, it may need additional devices to achieve better sound gain and an external shock mount to better resist vibrations.</p>

<p>Looking for a quality <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? There are 2 things that make for good YouTube content: quality pictures and quality audio. If you are an ambitious YouTuber, you cannot afford to compromise on either of these. In fact, many would argue that having good audio is far more important than having good visuals, the reason being that poor audio is sure to discourage people from viewing your video no matter how great the pictures are.</p>
<p>This is why it’s important to invest in a good microphone for your YouTube videos. The best microphone for you will depend on the kind of videos you make and also where you do your recording. In this post, we tell you the top 19 microphones for making YouTube videos and we’ve grouped our top picks based on the type and setting of the video.</p>

This is why microphones with large diaphragms, noise cancellation, and the capacity for high-pressure sound recording are ideal. Here are our top 3 microphones for singing and recording music.</p>
<h4 id="1-Audio-Technica-AT2035-2"><a href="#1-Audio-Technica-AT2035-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Audio-Technica AT2035"></a>1. Audio-Technica AT2035</h4><p>The Audio-Technica AT2035 is a versatile condenser microphone that delivers excellent sound quality. It boasts a big diaphragm that enables it to pick up direct frontal sound very well and can also handle high-pressure sounds. According to some reviewers, this mic may pick up background noise if used in an environment that isn’t soundproof. That said, experienced vocalists and musicians are very pleased with the quality and warmth of the sound captured by this mic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Rode-NT1-A-2"><a href="#2-Rode-NT1-A-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Rode NT1-A"></a>2. Rode NT1-A</h4><p>The Rode NT1-A is a top-performing condenser mic that delivers the kind of professional sound quality YouTube vocalists and instrumentalists want from their studio recordings. Its great sound quality, low self-noise, and extended dynamic range make it remarkable for microphones in its class. It also comes with advanced features and its own Phantom power pack. Though priced higher than similar microphones, many YouTubers would agree that the quality delivered by the Rode NT1-A is well worth the additional cost.</p>
<h4 id="3-AKG-C214-2"><a href="#3-AKG-C214-2" class="headerlink" title="3. AKG C214"></a>3. AKG C214</h4><p>The AKG C214 is by far the best studio-quality condenser microphone on this list. It is equipped with a large diaphragm for faultless sound fidelity and depth. It also has a bass filter and an attenuation pad that work together to capture loud and up-close bass sounds without audio artifacts. This mic is great for recording vocals as well as instruments and is famous for its durable build and consistent top-quality performance. The AKG C214 microphone is a great option for YouTube performing artists who are ready to up their game and produce content of impeccable quality.</p>
<h2 id="The-Top-6-Condenser-Microphones-For-Podcasts-Interviews-and-Voiceovers-2"><a href="#The-Top-6-Condenser-Microphones-For-Podcasts-Interviews-and-Voiceovers-2" class="headerlink" title="The Top 6 Condenser Microphones For Podcasts, Interviews, and Voiceovers"></a>The Top 6 Condenser Microphones For Podcasts, Interviews, and Voiceovers</h2><p>Podcasts, interviews, and voiceovers are often shot in offices that double as studios. Usually, the podcaster and interviewees are seated at a desk in front of or next to a computer and may in fact be recording using a webcam. Here are 6 microphone options that give you the flexibility and connectivity you need for podcasts, voiceovers, and interviews.</p>
<h4 id="1-Apogee-Mic-96K-2"><a href="#1-Apogee-Mic-96K-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Apogee Mic 96K"></a>1. Apogee Mic 96K</h4><p>The Apogee Mic 96K is a plug-n-play cardioid USB mic that’s great for recording unidirectional sound like the human voice. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac (although it was primarily designed for Mac) and is perfect for recording simple voiceover videos and weekly podcasts. It’s also quite flexible and can be connected to mobile devices and cameras for both indoor studios and outdoor use.</p>
<h4 id="2-Blue-Yeti-2"><a href="#2-Blue-Yeti-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Blue Yeti"></a>2. Blue Yeti</h4><p>The Blue Yeti is a popular USB condenser mic among YouTubers and podcasters. It delivers great sound quality in its cardioid mode (cardioid means it only records sound from in front of itself) and can be switched into other 3 other polar patterns thanks to its 3 in-build condenser capsules. This means that the Blue Yeti can be configured for bidirectional, stereo, and omnidirectional sound. This mic also comes at a relatively affordable price and is compatible with Windows and Mac. While most reviewers would not recommend it for recording studio music, it delivers the desired sound quality and range for YouTubers who focus on voiceover recordings and interviews.</p>
<h4 id="3-Rode-NT-USB-2"><a href="#3-Rode-NT-USB-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Rode NT-USB"></a>3. Rode NT-USB</h4><p>The Rode NT-USB is a great plug-n-play mic that comes with useful supporting equipment including a tripod mount and a storage pouch as well as a USB cable. It also has other desirable features like a 3.5mm headphone jack and on-mic mix control. That said, it lacks the voice configuration versatility of the Blue Yeti and is relatively more expensive. That said, this is one microphone that will impress fans of the Rode brand.</p>
<h4 id="4-Blue-Snowball-2"><a href="#4-Blue-Snowball-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Blue Snowball"></a>4. Blue Snowball</h4><p>The Blue Snowball is a cool USB microphone that’s perfect for YouTubers on a budget. It has 2 sound recording configurations and will do a good job of capturing voiceover recording, podcasts, and interviews. The Blue Snowball is however very low on additional features and perhaps this is why it’s so much more affordable than the Blue Yeti. Depending on the Snowball model you buy, you may get no configuration options, no headphone jack, and no stand. All in all, this is a great starter-mic for voiceover YouTubers who are new to the game.</p>
<h4 id="5-Audio-Technica-AT2020-2"><a href="#5-Audio-Technica-AT2020-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Audio-Technica AT2020"></a>5. Audio-Technica AT2020</h4><p>The Audio-Technica AT2020 is a solid USB mic that’s especially good for voiceover recordings and one-person podcasts. It is built with only a cardioid unidirectional setting and may not deliver the best sound quality in a video involving more than 2 people. Its newer model also has additional functional options like a headphone jack and mix dial which was not available on the older model. That said, it may cost less than a Blue Yeti for most shoppers and delivers enough functionality and sound quality for the average YouTube voiceover recording.</p>
<h4 id="6-Rode-Procaster-2"><a href="#6-Rode-Procaster-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Rode Procaster"></a>6. Rode Procaster</h4><p>The Rode Procaster is a great cardioid microphone for voiceover recordings and podcasts. It is known to perform well when placed close to the speaker and comes with an internal shock mount to reduce vibrations in voiceover recordings. While it performs quite well for a cardioid mic, it may need additional devices to achieve better sound gain and an external shock mount to better resist vibrations.</p>
<h2 id="The-Top-4-Camera-Mounted-Shotgun-Microphones-2"><a href="#The-Top-4-Camera-Mounted-Shotgun-Microphones-2" class="headerlink" title="The Top 4 Camera Mounted Shotgun Microphones"></a>The Top 4 Camera Mounted Shotgun Microphones</h2><p>Shotgun microphones are great for outdoor recording because they feature solid ambient sound cancellation and add-on windshields to keep wind interference to a minimum. They can achieve remarkable ambient noise cancellation due to the narrow area through which they capture sound vibrations. They also tend to come with hot-shoe or cold-shoe mounts to fit easily on cameras. Our top 4 shotgun microphones for on-the-go vlogging are listed below:</p>
<h4 id="1-Rode-VideoMic-Go-2"><a href="#1-Rode-VideoMic-Go-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Rode VideoMic Go"></a>1.

As a digital audio recorder, the Shure VP83 can support the creation of improved audio recordings. It comes with a hot-shoe mount with in-built shock-absorbing tech for better vibration reduction. Instead of investing in a separate mic and digital audio recorder, the VP83 is a great 2-in-1 alternative that performs as well as expected.</p>
<h4 id="3-Rode-VideoMic-Pro-2"><a href="#3-Rode-VideoMic-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Rode VideoMic Pro+"></a>3. Rode VideoMic Pro+</h4><p>The Rode VideoMic Pro+ comes with the proprietary Rode Rycote Lyre mount for excellent vibration reduction. It sits comfortably on most DSLR cameras and performs well in quick motion recording scenarios.

<h4 id="4-Sennheiser-MKE-440-2"><a href="#4-Sennheiser-MKE-440-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Sennheiser MKE 440"></a>4. Sennheiser MKE 440</h4><p>The Sennheiser MKE 44O is a top-of-the-line shotgun microphone that captures stereo sound beautifully. This v-shaped microphone can capture stereo sound optimally.

<h2 id="Best-Shotgun-Microphones-For-Out-Of-Frame-Audio-Recording-2"><a href="#Best-Shotgun-Microphones-For-Out-Of-Frame-Audio-Recording-2" class="headerlink" title="Best Shotgun Microphones For Out-Of-Frame Audio Recording"></a>Best Shotgun Microphones For Out-Of-Frame Audio Recording</h2><p>For out-of-frame audio recordings, shotgun microphones with broader sound pick-up patterns and intelligent noise cancellation are preferred. The objective here is to capture high-fidelity audio even when there’s more than one subject and you’re shooting a video with dynamic audio patterns. It’s the sort of recording hardware that’s needed for more professional indoor and field video recordings. Out top 3 picks for out-of-frame audio recordings are below.</p>
<h4 id="1-Rode-NTG-3-2"><a href="#1-Rode-NTG-3-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Rode NTG-3"></a>1. Rode NTG-3</h4><p>The Rode NTG-3 is an impressive shotgun mic with very great specs.

To prove its power and top-of-the-line performance, the MKH416 is often used on movie sets and can pick-up long-distance sound impeccably.</p>
<h2 id="The-Top-3-Low-Profile-Lavalier-Microphones-2"><a href="#The-Top-3-Low-Profile-Lavalier-Microphones-2" class="headerlink" title="The Top 3 Low-Profile Lavalier Microphones"></a>The Top 3 Low-Profile Lavalier Microphones</h2><p>Lavalier microphones are ideal for any scenario where you need a microphone that’s small and easy to conceal, or which records your voice from close-up. Lavalier mics are hands-free microphones which are usually clipped onto clothing to capture high fidelity voice audio with as little sound interference as possible. They tend to be omnidirectional but perform well for voice recordings because they’re usually placed very close to the speaker’s mouth. Our top 3 picks are below:</p>
<h4 id="1-Rode-SmartLav-2"><a href="#1-Rode-SmartLav-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Rode SmartLav+"></a>1. Rode SmartLav+</h4><p>The Rode SmartLav+ is the go-to Lavalier mic for most YouTubers. It is compatible with most modern smartphones and can be used as personal vlogging. The SmartLav+ captures great voice audio.

<h2 id="The-Top-3-Low-Profile-Lavalier-Microphones-3"><a href="#The-Top-3-Low-Profile-Lavalier-Microphones-3" class="headerlink" title="The Top 3 Low-Profile Lavalier Microphones"></a>The Top 3 Low-Profile Lavalier Microphones</h2><p>Lavalier microphones are ideal for any scenario where you need a microphone that’s small and easy to conceal, or which records your voice from close-up. Lavalier mics are hands-free microphones which are usually clipped onto clothing to capture high fidelity voice audio with as little sound interference as possible. They tend to be omnidirectional but perform well for voice recordings because they’re usually placed very close to the speaker’s mouth. Our top 3 picks are below:</p>

<h4 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATR3350iS-3"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATR3350iS-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio-Technica ATR3350iS"></a>2.

Be sure to take precautions and handle with care to avoid damaging your ATR3350iS.</p>
<h4 id="3-Sennheiser-ME2-3"><a href="#3-Sennheiser-ME2-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Sennheiser ME2"></a>3. Sennheiser ME2</h4><p>Coming from the Sennheiser brand, the ME2 is considered a relatively affordable professional lavalier mic.
