<p>After uploading your video on YouTube, you may want to sit back and enjoy the massive uptick of views and subscribers. However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p>
<p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p>
<p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p>
<p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p>
<p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p>
<p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p>
<p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p>
<p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p>
<p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p>
<p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram"></a>1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p>
<p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p>
<p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p>

<h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life" class="headerlink" title="2. Share Your Life"></a>2. Share Your Life</h4><p>Instagram allows you to consistently post content from your life. This allows you to connect with your audience as they discover more about you, so when it comes time for the YouTube video, they feel that have an established relationship with you.</p>
<p>They see your picture or video on their feed every day after all. You and your followers are practically friends.</p>
<p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p>

This piece of content will stay on your page forever, or until you delete it.</p>
<p>Like your YouTube videos, the content you post to your Instagram directly should have a cohesive theme that matches your branding. Keep an eye on your: -</p>
<p>- Aesthetic</p>
<p>- Caption</p>
<p>- Filter</p>

<p>Here’s Liza Koshy’s Instagram feed. As you can see, she has a clear style and also a variety of content.

<p>This will be a good place to post a teaser of your latest video, upload an inspiring image, or share an interesting piece of content that shows the world what you are all about.</p>
<p>Have a different type of content lined up. You don’t want someone to end up on your Instagram page and only see selfies or inspiring quotes.</p>
<p>You won’t know which type of content will hook your next fan… so experiment.</p>
<p>When you post onto Instagram directly, you can’t add a are unable to link in the caption. This has been a bane for marketers and creators since the beginning of Instagram.</p>

<p>While Instagram is a great engagement platform, it hasn’t been the best channel for those who want to have a direct call to action. The old method was to direct the viewer to your Instagram bio where there is the only place to post a link.</p>
<p>However, once you’ve gained a large following (10K) you will be able to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-add-a-link-to-your-instagram-stories/" >attached links <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Instagram Story.</p>

After that, the collection of content — or “story” — from that day disappears.</p>

Don’t want your Instagram Story to disappear forever?</h4><p>There is a feature called “Highlight” which archives your stories so that you can view them later, however, they will be kept on your Instagram profile page. This allows visitors to see your best stories and have prepared content even when you go 24 hours without posting something new.</p>

<p>Unlike posting directly to the Instagram timeline, once you reach a certain milestone, Instagram Story allows you to create a link right in the content. The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content. By doing so, you redirect them from Instagram to your YouTube video.</p>

<p>Don’t think of Instagram Story as simply a mean for promoting your video, but a chance to give your loyal viewers an exclusive view into your process, allow them to get familiar with your personality and increase the exposure of your brand as a whole, solidifying your relationship.</p>

With that claim, it can help any new YouTuber find and grow their audience. It doesn’t matter if their channel is about fashion or karate, Facebook is an appropriate platform for interacting with the audience, as long as the content you share is relevant and click-worthy.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to share content on Facebook:</p>
<p>- Sharing on your own personal timeline allows your Friends to see the content.</p>
<p>- Sharing directly to a particular group or person’s feed assures those in the group or that specific person will see the content.</p>
<p>- Sharing via a separate Page you’ve built for your YouTube channel allows those who are following the page to see the content.</p>

<p>When you post your video from YouTube directly to Facebook, it’ll look something like the image above. Unremarkable. While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p>
<p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p>
<p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p>

<p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com. Yet, anyone viewing the video there is watching on YouTube, not Facebook. This allows you to still capture all the views, likes, and comments on YouTube.</p>

Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s. Hard truths: building a following from scratch is going to be a lot of work.</p>
<h4 id="1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard"><a href="#1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard" class="headerlink" title="1. Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p>
<p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p>
<h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p>
<p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p>
<p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p>
<ol>
<li>Click “Create Pages”</li>
<li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li>
</ol>

                      alt="create facebook page"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li>
<li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img

                      alt="Facebook Page settings"
                ></li>
<li>INVITE!</li>
</ol>
<p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p>
<p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p>
<h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p>
<p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p>
<p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p>
<p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p>
<p>Managing Facebook involves:</p>
<p>- Posting content</p>
<p>- Responding to comments</p>
<p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p>

Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p>
<p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p>
<h4 id="1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags"><a href="#1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags" class="headerlink" title="1. Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags"></a>1. Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags</h4><p>In order to be successful on Twitter, you must be ready to jump onto a relevant trend. If you are talking about something that nobody is interested in, you might not be heard at all. Keep an eye on the most popular hashtags for that day and get involved with a conversation.</p>

<p>While you should definitely tweet and gain engagement for your YouTube videos, you will also need to tweet out other content.</p>
<p>Constantly keeping an eye on what the world is talking about gives you an idea of what is important to discuss. This may even help guide your next YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers"><a href="#2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="2. Tag Brands and Influencers"></a>2. Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p>
<p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p>

<p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p>
<p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p>
<p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p>

Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p>
<p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p>
<p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p>
<h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="1.

Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit</h4><p>If you can tap into the community values of Reddit, contribute to conversations and share interesting and relevant content there might not be a better platform to grow your YouTube audience.</p>
<p>Many media organizations with a significant following are starting to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@davelee/a-journalists-guide-to-reddit-your-newest-super-source-fa250e967b97" >use Reddit to find stories and viral content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The chances of being discovered on Reddit is much higher than on Twitter, as the upvote&#x2F;downvote system gives your good work a higher platform to stand on while lowering the bad content to Reddit’s cellar.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself"><a href="#2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p>
<p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p>
<p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p>
<p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p>
<p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p>

<p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p>

<p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p>
<p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there. Then again, you’ll never know.</p>

<p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p>
<p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p>
<p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p>
<h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p>
<p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p>
<p>Start following some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p>
<p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p>

<p>After uploading your video on YouTube, you may want to sit back and enjoy the massive uptick of views and subscribers. However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p>
<p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p>
<p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p>
<p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p>
<p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p>
<p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p>
<p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p>
<p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p>
<p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p>
<p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-1"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram"></a>1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p>
<p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p>
<p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p>

<h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life-1"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Share Your Life"></a>2. Share Your Life</h4><p>Instagram allows you to consistently post content from your life. This allows you to connect with your audience as they discover more about you, so when it comes time for the YouTube video, they feel that have an established relationship with you.</p>
<p>They see your picture or video on their feed every day after all. You and your followers are practically friends.</p>
<p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p>
<h3 id="How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-1"><a href="#How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-1" class="headerlink" title="How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed"></a>How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed</h3><p>When you post an image or a video onto Instagram directly it will be on your timeline and acts as a tile for your whole Instagram feed page. This piece of content will stay on your page forever, or until you delete it.</p>
<p>Like your YouTube videos, the content you post to your Instagram directly should have a cohesive theme that matches your branding. Keep an eye on your: -</p>
<p>- Aesthetic</p>
<p>- Caption</p>
<p>- Filter</p>
<p>As Instagram has grown in popularity, a lot of tools have been developed to help creators like yourself. Here are a few apps that you can include in your kit:</p>
<p>- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vsco.co/"><strong>VSCO</strong></a>: A photo editor app that will allow you to clean up and enhance details to really make your visuals pop.</p>
<p>- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://unum.la/"><strong>UNUM</strong></a>: An Instagram planner app that enables you to visualize and pre-plan your post.</p>
<p>- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://later.com/"><strong>Later</strong></a>: A scheduling tool you can use to auto-publish to directly to Instagram.</p>
<p>- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.planoly.com/"><strong>Planoly</strong></a>: Drag and drop scheduler and planner, allows you to see the whole grid before posting.</p>
<p>Here’s Liza Koshy’s Instagram feed. As you can see, she has a clear style and also a variety of content. If you haven’t heard of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/lizakoshy/" >Liza Koshy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and found her through Instagram, you get curious: “What does she do?” Instagram is fantastic for building intrigue and garnering interest.</p>

<p>This will be a good place to post a teaser of your latest video, upload an inspiring image, or share an interesting piece of content that shows the world what you are all about.</p>
<p>Have a different type of content lined up. You don’t want someone to end up on your Instagram page and only see selfies or inspiring quotes.</p>
<p>You won’t know which type of content will hook your next fan… so experiment.</p>
<p>When you post onto Instagram directly, you can’t add a are unable to link in the caption. This has been a bane for marketers and creators since the beginning of Instagram.</p>

<p><em>Instagram: Pointless Blog</em></p>
<p>While Instagram is a great engagement platform, it hasn’t been the best channel for those who want to have a direct call to action. The old method was to direct the viewer to your Instagram bio where there is the only place to post a link.</p>
<p>However, once you’ve gained a large following (10K) you will be able to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-add-a-link-to-your-instagram-stories/" >attached links <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Instagram Story.</p>

How YouTubers Should on Post Instagram Story "></a>2. How YouTubers Should on Post Instagram Story </h3 ></h3><p>Instagram Story allows you to post a series of images and videos over the course of 24 hours. After that, the collection of content — or “story” — from that day disappears.</p>
<h4 id="1-Don’t-want-your-Instagram-Story-to-disappear-forever-1"><a href="#1-Don’t-want-your-Instagram-Story-to-disappear-forever-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t want your Instagram Story to disappear forever?"></a>1. Don’t want your Instagram Story to disappear forever?</h4><p>There is a feature called “Highlight” which archives your stories so that you can view them later, however, they will be kept on your Instagram profile page. This allows visitors to see your best stories and have prepared content even when you go 24 hours without posting something new.</p>

Use Instagram Story to Make an Announcement</h4><p>While you are uploading your latest video to YouTube, go on Instagram Story and let your followers know.</p>
<p>Unlike posting directly to the Instagram timeline, once you reach a certain milestone, Instagram Story allows you to create a link right in the content. The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content. By doing so, you redirect them from Instagram to your YouTube video.</p>

<p>Don’t think of Instagram Story as simply a mean for promoting your video, but a chance to give your loyal viewers an exclusive view into your process, allow them to get familiar with your personality and increase the exposure of your brand as a whole, solidifying your relationship.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Facebook is the world’s most popular social media platform. With that claim, it can help any new YouTuber find and grow their audience. It doesn’t matter if their channel is about fashion or karate, Facebook is an appropriate platform for interacting with the audience, as long as the content you share is relevant and click-worthy.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to share content on Facebook:</p>
<p>- Sharing on your own personal timeline allows your Friends to see the content.</p>
<p>- Sharing directly to a particular group or person’s feed assures those in the group or that specific person will see the content.</p>
<p>- Sharing via a separate Page you’ve built for your YouTube channel allows those who are following the page to see the content.</p>

Improve YouTube Video Thumbnail on Facebook</h4><p>Facebook doesn’t make it easy for YouTubers to show their video on Facebook’s news feed, especially if it is hosted on YouTube.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>When you post your video from YouTube directly to Facebook, it’ll look something like the image above. Unremarkable. While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p>
<p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p>
<p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p>

                      alt="Share YouTube on Facebook 2"
                ></p>
<p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com. Yet, anyone viewing the video there is watching on YouTube, not Facebook. This allows you to still capture all the views, likes, and comments on YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="1-Managing-a-Facebook-Page-for-Your-YouTube-Channel-1"><a href="#1-Managing-a-Facebook-Page-for-Your-YouTube-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel"></a>1. Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s. Hard truths: building a following from scratch is going to be a lot of work.</p>
<h4 id="1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard-1"><a href="#1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p>
<p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p>
<h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-1"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p>
<p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p>
<p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p>
<ol>
<li>Click “Create Pages”</li>
<li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li>
</ol>

                      alt="create facebook page"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li>
<li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Facebook Page settings"
                ></li>
<li>INVITE!</li>
</ol>
<p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p>
<p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p>
<h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-1"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p>
<p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p>
<p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p>
<p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p>
<p>Managing Facebook involves:</p>
<p>- Posting content</p>
<p>- Responding to comments</p>
<p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p>

<p>Don’t spread yourself too thin. If YouTube is your priority, all other social media communities should be complementary, not an obligation.</p>

Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p>
<p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p>

Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags</h4><p>In order to be successful on Twitter, you must be ready to jump onto a relevant trend. If you are talking about something that nobody is interested in, you might not be heard at all. Keep an eye on the most popular hashtags for that day and get involved with a conversation.</p>

                ></p>
<p>While you should definitely tweet and gain engagement for your YouTube videos, you will also need to tweet out other content.</p>
<p>Constantly keeping an eye on what the world is talking about gives you an idea of what is important to discuss. This may even help guide your next YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers-1"><a href="#2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Tag Brands and Influencers"></a>2. Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p>
<p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p>

<p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p>
<p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p>

Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p>
<p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p>
<p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p>
<h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-1"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit"></a>1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit</h4><p>If you can tap into the community values of Reddit, contribute to conversations and share interesting and relevant content there might not be a better platform to grow your YouTube audience.</p>
<p>Many media organizations with a significant following are starting to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@davelee/a-journalists-guide-to-reddit-your-newest-super-source-fa250e967b97" >use Reddit to find stories and viral content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The chances of being discovered on Reddit is much higher than on Twitter, as the upvote&#x2F;downvote system gives your good work a higher platform to stand on while lowering the bad content to Reddit’s cellar.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself-1"><a href="#2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p>
<p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p>
<p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p>
<p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p>
<p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p>

Understand the Reddiquettes</h4><p>When engaging on Reddit, you must abide by rules which are called “reddiquette.” There are global reddiquettes and then there are individual community reddiquette.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"><strong>Global reddiquettes</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>- Search for duplicate content before posting.</p>
<p>- Consume the content before voting.</p>
<p>- Act as you would in real life.</p>
<p>- And more.</p>
<h4 id="3-Community-reddiquettes-1"><a href="#3-Community-reddiquettes-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Community reddiquettes"></a>3. Community reddiquettes</h4><p>These are additional rules that the individual Reddit communities enforce. Be sure to read these rules before posting onto these specific communities. Understanding these rules will help you understand the purpose of this community.</p>
<p>Here is an example of reddiquettes for r&#x2F;Cameras:</p>

                ></p>
<p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p>
<p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p>
<h4 id="4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely-1"><a href="#4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely"></a>4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely</h4><p>While there are some subreddits that demand relevant content, some subreddits will allow you post your videos as long as 90% of your content are from another source aside from your YouTube channel, you won’t be considered spammy.</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p>
<p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there. Then again, you’ll never know.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>If your audience craves immediacy and exclusivity, then Snapchat is definitely the social media channel that you’d want to explore.</p>
<p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p>
<p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p>
<p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p>
<h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-1"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p>
<p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p>
<p>Start following some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p>
<p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p>

<p>After uploading your video on YouTube, you may want to sit back and enjoy the massive uptick of views and subscribers. However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p>
<p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p>
<p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p>
<p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p>
<p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p>
<p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p>
<p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p>

<p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p>
<p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p>
<p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-2"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram"></a>1. Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p>
<p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p>
<p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p>

<h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life-2"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Share Your Life"></a>2. Share Your Life</h4><p>Instagram allows you to consistently post content from your life. This allows you to connect with your audience as they discover more about you, so when it comes time for the YouTube video, they feel that have an established relationship with you.</p>
<p>They see your picture or video on their feed every day after all. You and your followers are practically friends.</p>
<p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p>
<h3 id="How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-2"><a href="#How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-2" class="headerlink" title="How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed"></a>How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed</h3><p>When you post an image or a video onto Instagram directly it will be on your timeline and acts as a tile for your whole Instagram feed page. This piece of content will stay on your page forever, or until you delete it.</p>
<p>Like your YouTube videos, the content you post to your Instagram directly should have a cohesive theme that matches your branding. Keep an eye on your: -</p>
<p>- Aesthetic</p>
<p>- Caption</p>
<p>- Filter</p>
<p>As Instagram has grown in popularity, a lot of tools have been developed to help creators like yourself. Here are a few apps that you can include in your kit:</p>
<p>- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vsco.co/"><strong>VSCO</strong></a>: A photo editor app that will allow you to clean up and enhance details to really make your visuals pop.</p>
<p>- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://unum.la/"><strong>UNUM</strong></a>: An Instagram planner app that enables you to visualize and pre-plan your post.</p>
<p>- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://later.com/"><strong>Later</strong></a>: A scheduling tool you can use to auto-publish to directly to Instagram.</p>

<p>Here’s Liza Koshy’s Instagram feed. As you can see, she has a clear style and also a variety of content.

<p>This will be a good place to post a teaser of your latest video, upload an inspiring image, or share an interesting piece of content that shows the world what you are all about.</p>
<p>Have a different type of content lined up. You don’t want someone to end up on your Instagram page and only see selfies or inspiring quotes.</p>
<p>You won’t know which type of content will hook your next fan… so experiment.</p>
<p>When you post onto Instagram directly, you can’t add a are unable to link in the caption. This has been a bane for marketers and creators since the beginning of Instagram.</p>

<p>While Instagram is a great engagement platform, it hasn’t been the best channel for those who want to have a direct call to action. The old method was to direct the viewer to your Instagram bio where there is the only place to post a link.</p>
<p>However, once you’ve gained a large following (10K) you will be able to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-add-a-link-to-your-instagram-stories/" >attached links <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Instagram Story.</p>

After that, the collection of content — or “story” — from that day disappears.</p>

Use Instagram Story to Make an Announcement</h4><p>While you are uploading your latest video to YouTube, go on Instagram Story and let your followers know.</p>
<p>Unlike posting directly to the Instagram timeline, once you reach a certain milestone, Instagram Story allows you to create a link right in the content. The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content. By doing so, you redirect them from Instagram to your YouTube video.</p>

<p>Don’t think of Instagram Story as simply a mean for promoting your video, but a chance to give your loyal viewers an exclusive view into your process, allow them to get familiar with your personality and increase the exposure of your brand as a whole, solidifying your relationship.</p>

With that claim, it can help any new YouTuber find and grow their audience. It doesn’t matter if their channel is about fashion or karate, Facebook is an appropriate platform for interacting with the audience, as long as the content you share is relevant and click-worthy.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to share content on Facebook:</p>
<p>- Sharing on your own personal timeline allows your Friends to see the content.</p>
<p>- Sharing directly to a particular group or person’s feed assures those in the group or that specific person will see the content.</p>
<p>- Sharing via a separate Page you’ve built for your YouTube channel allows those who are following the page to see the content.</p>

<p>When you post your video from YouTube directly to Facebook, it’ll look something like the image above. Unremarkable. While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p>
<p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p>
<p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p>

<p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com. Yet, anyone viewing the video there is watching on YouTube, not Facebook. This allows you to still capture all the views, likes, and comments on YouTube.</p>

<h4 id="1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard-2"><a href="#1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p>
<p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p>
<h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-2"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p>
<p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p>
<p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p>
<ol>
<li>Click “Create Pages”</li>
<li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li>
</ol>

                      alt="create facebook page"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li>
<li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Facebook Page settings"
                ></li>
<li>INVITE!</li>
</ol>
<p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p>
<p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p>
<h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-2"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p>
<p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p>
<p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p>
<p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p>
<p>Managing Facebook involves:</p>
<p>- Posting content</p>
<p>- Responding to comments</p>
<p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p>

<p>Don’t spread yourself too thin. If YouTube is your priority, all other social media communities should be complementary, not an obligation.</p>

Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p>
<p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p>
<h4 id="1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-2"><a href="#1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags"></a>1. Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags</h4><p>In order to be successful on Twitter, you must be ready to jump onto a relevant trend. If you are talking about something that nobody is interested in, you might not be heard at all. Keep an eye on the most popular hashtags for that day and get involved with a conversation.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>While you should definitely tweet and gain engagement for your YouTube videos, you will also need to tweet out other content.</p>
<p>Constantly keeping an eye on what the world is talking about gives you an idea of what is important to discuss. This may even help guide your next YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers-2"><a href="#2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Tag Brands and Influencers"></a>2. Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p>
<p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p>
<p><img

<p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p>
<p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p>
<p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p>
<p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place. Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p>
<p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p>
<p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p>
<h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-2"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit"></a>1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit</h4><p>If you can tap into the community values of Reddit, contribute to conversations and share interesting and relevant content there might not be a better platform to grow your YouTube audience.</p>
<p>Many media organizations with a significant following are starting to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@davelee/a-journalists-guide-to-reddit-your-newest-super-source-fa250e967b97" >use Reddit to find stories and viral content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The chances of being discovered on Reddit is much higher than on Twitter, as the upvote&#x2F;downvote system gives your good work a higher platform to stand on while lowering the bad content to Reddit’s cellar.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself-2"><a href="#2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p>
<p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p>
<p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p>
<p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p>
<p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p>
<h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-2"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand the Reddiquettes"></a>3. Understand the Reddiquettes</h4><p>When engaging on Reddit, you must abide by rules which are called “reddiquette.” There are global reddiquettes and then there are individual community reddiquette.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"><strong>Global reddiquettes</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>- Search for duplicate content before posting.</p>
<p>- Consume the content before voting.</p>
<p>- Act as you would in real life.</p>
<p>- And more.</p>
<h4 id="3-Community-reddiquettes-2"><a href="#3-Community-reddiquettes-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Community reddiquettes"></a>3. Community reddiquettes</h4><p>These are additional rules that the individual Reddit communities enforce. Be sure to read these rules before posting onto these specific communities. Understanding these rules will help you understand the purpose of this community.</p>
<p>Here is an example of reddiquettes for r&#x2F;Cameras:</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p>
<p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p>
<h4 id="4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely-2"><a href="#4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely"></a>4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely</h4><p>While there are some subreddits that demand relevant content, some subreddits will allow you post your videos as long as 90% of your content are from another source aside from your YouTube channel, you won’t be considered spammy.</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p>
<p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there. Then again, you’ll never know.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2"><a href="#Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>If your audience craves immediacy and exclusivity, then Snapchat is definitely the social media channel that you’d want to explore.</p>
<p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p>
<p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p>
<p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p>
<h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-2"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p>
<p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p>
<p>Start following some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p>
<p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p>

<p>After uploading your video on YouTube, you may want to sit back and enjoy the massive uptick of views and subscribers. However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p>
<p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p>
<p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p>
<p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p>
<p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p>
<p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p>
<p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p>
<p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p>

<p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p>
<p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p>
<p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-3"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p>
<p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p>
<p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p>

This allows you to connect with your audience as they discover more about you, so when it comes time for the YouTube video, they feel that have an established relationship with you.</p>
<p>They see your picture or video on their feed every day after all. You and your followers are practically friends.</p>
<p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p>

This piece of content will stay on your page forever, or until you delete it.</p>
<p>Like your YouTube videos, the content you post to your Instagram directly should have a cohesive theme that matches your branding. Keep an eye on your: -</p>
<p>- Aesthetic</p>
<p>- Caption</p>
<p>- Filter</p>
<p>As Instagram has grown in popularity, a lot of tools have been developed to help creators like yourself. Here are a few apps that you can include in your kit:</p>
<p>- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vsco.co/"><strong>VSCO</strong></a>: A photo editor app that will allow you to clean up and enhance details to really make your visuals pop.</p>
<p>- <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://unum.la/"><strong>UNUM</strong></a>: An Instagram planner app that enables you to visualize and pre-plan your post.</p>

<p>This will be a good place to post a teaser of your latest video, upload an inspiring image, or share an interesting piece of content that shows the world what you are all about.</p>
<p>Have a different type of content lined up. You don’t want someone to end up on your Instagram page and only see selfies or inspiring quotes.</p>
<p>You won’t know which type of content will hook your next fan… so experiment.</p>
<p>When you post onto Instagram directly, you can’t add a are unable to link in the caption. This has been a bane for marketers and creators since the beginning of Instagram.</p>

<p>While Instagram is a great engagement platform, it hasn’t been the best channel for those who want to have a direct call to action. The old method was to direct the viewer to your Instagram bio where there is the only place to post a link.</p>
<p>However, once you’ve gained a large following (10K) you will be able to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-add-a-link-to-your-instagram-stories/" >attached links <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Instagram Story.</p>

After that, the collection of content — or “story” — from that day disappears.</p>

Don’t want your Instagram Story to disappear forever?</h4><p>There is a feature called “Highlight” which archives your stories so that you can view them later, however, they will be kept on your Instagram profile page. This allows visitors to see your best stories and have prepared content even when you go 24 hours without posting something new.</p>

Use Instagram Story to Make an Announcement</h4><p>While you are uploading your latest video to YouTube, go on Instagram Story and let your followers know.</p>
<p>Unlike posting directly to the Instagram timeline, once you reach a certain milestone, Instagram Story allows you to create a link right in the content. The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content. By doing so, you redirect them from Instagram to your YouTube video.</p>

With that claim, it can help any new YouTuber find and grow their audience. It doesn’t matter if their channel is about fashion or karate, Facebook is an appropriate platform for interacting with the audience, as long as the content you share is relevant and click-worthy.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to share content on Facebook:</p>
<p>- Sharing on your own personal timeline allows your Friends to see the content.</p>
<p>- Sharing directly to a particular group or person’s feed assures those in the group or that specific person will see the content.</p>
<p>- Sharing via a separate Page you’ve built for your YouTube channel allows those who are following the page to see the content.</p>

<p>When you post your video from YouTube directly to Facebook, it’ll look something like the image above. Unremarkable. While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p>
<p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p>
<p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p>

<p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com. Yet, anyone viewing the video there is watching on YouTube, not Facebook. This allows you to still capture all the views, likes, and comments on YouTube.</p>

Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s. Hard truths: building a following from scratch is going to be a lot of work.</p>
<h4 id="1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard-3"><a href="#1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p>
<p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p>
<h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-3"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p>
<p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p>
<p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p>
<ol>
<li>Click “Create Pages”</li>
<li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li>
<li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img

                      alt="Facebook Page settings"
                ></li>
<li>INVITE!</li>
</ol>
<p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p>
<p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p>
<h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-3"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p>
<p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p>
<p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p>
<p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p>
<p>Managing Facebook involves:</p>
<p>- Posting content</p>
<p>- Responding to comments</p>
<p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p>

Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p>
<p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p>

Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags</h4><p>In order to be successful on Twitter, you must be ready to jump onto a relevant trend. If you are talking about something that nobody is interested in, you might not be heard at all. Keep an eye on the most popular hashtags for that day and get involved with a conversation.</p>

<p>While you should definitely tweet and gain engagement for your YouTube videos, you will also need to tweet out other content.</p>
<p>Constantly keeping an eye on what the world is talking about gives you an idea of what is important to discuss. This may even help guide your next YouTube video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers-3"><a href="#2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Tag Brands and Influencers"></a>2. Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p>
<p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p>

<p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p>
<p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p>
<p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p>

Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p>
<p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p>
<p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p>

<h4 id="2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself-3"><a href="#2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p>
<p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p>
<p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p>
<p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p>
<p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p>

<p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p>
<p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p>

<p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p>
<p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p>
<p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there. Then again, you’ll never know.</p>

<p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p>
<p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p>
<p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p>
<h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-3"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p>
<p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p>
<p>Start following some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p>
<p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p>

<p><strong>Unboxing videos</strong> are a bizarre trend. However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.</p>
<p>And, if you haven’t already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like. At its core, “unboxing” is the procedure of recording the moment when a particular product is removed and opened from the packaging sold in.</p>
<p>Again, you’re probably thinking:</p>
<p>‘Why would anybody gaze at other folks opening their product packaging?’</p>
<p>More than 90,000 people type ‘unboxing’ into YouTube each month, and that’s quite interesting as well as strange. Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.</p>

Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.</p>
<p>Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don’t generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.</p>

<p>Keeping it in mind, here are some of the top YouTube unboxing channels for inspiration:</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-a-Killer-Unboxing-Video"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-a-Killer-Unboxing-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video</strong></h2><p>Firstly, you have to take note of the following points to create the best unboxing videos.</p>
<p>1. Select an Unboxing Niche</p>
<p>2. Practice Speaking Clearly and Slowly</p>
<p>3. Use the Best Unboxing Set-Up</p>
<p>4. Make Sure to Timely Unbox the Products</p>
<p>5. Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p>
<p>6. Show the Product in Use</p>
<p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.</p>
<p>Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p>
<p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p>
<p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p>
<p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that’s extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.</p>

<h3 id="2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox"><a href="#2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox" class="headerlink" title="2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox"></a>2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox</h3><p>If you look at some famous unboxing channels listed above, you’ll notice that much of their content is shot in a well-framed space where there isn’t much in the background to disturb them from the product being viewed.</p>
<p>Often, this is a “photo lightbox” or an empty table (a small container with a smooth white backdrop that enhances lighting while reducing shadows for making photos look greater). Lightboxes can also be helpful when you’re taking snapshots of your products to put up on your eCommerce website, so it’s a great idea to make (or buy) one that can fit your products.</p>
<h3 id="3-Practice-Making-Videos"><a href="#3-Practice-Making-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Practice Making Videos"></a>3. Practice Making Videos</h3><p>Before uploading videos to YouTube, take some time to practice making your unboxing videos using random items or already-opened products. This way, you can work upon setting up your stage and camera, keeping the product within an aim, narrating your unboxing video, editing footage to reduce the “dead air” where nothing is being done or said, and more!</p>
<p>When you’re over making your first test video, play it back and look for issues like excessive “ums, ahs,” or things that are out of focus and other sentence fillers. Don’t worry if your first video isn’t that great—that’s what practice (and your video editing software) are for!</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time"><a href="#4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Waste Your Viewers’ Time"></a>4. Don’t Waste Your Viewers’ Time</h3><p>If you want to make the best unboxing videos, ensure that you get to the “unboxing” section quite instantly! As indicated by the Expert Voice: “remember that you compete for viewers’ attention with lots of other video content. Keep your introductions brief and quickly get to the unboxing.” If you take too much time to get to the section of unboxing video, you risk losing your audience’s interest and them going away from your content before you can introduce your product.</p>
<h3 id="5-Compile-Things-Up-Once-in-a-While"><a href="#5-Compile-Things-Up-Once-in-a-While" class="headerlink" title="5. Compile Things Up Once in a While"></a>5. Compile Things Up Once in a While</h3><p>If you unbox your products, you might instantly run out of content ideas to make. You may look up your YouTube channel losing traction without the new content. So, try to compile things up once in a while—as the Ryan’s World channel discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Creating other kinds of content, such as how-to videos and advice videos for specific products, product updates, and simple news, or even short promotional bits, can help keep your publishing frequency top-notch.</p>
<p>Just remember: everything you publish or post should still be related to your brand and your channel’s core content!</p>
<h3 id="6-Promote-Your-YouTube-Video-or-Channel-on-Social-Media"><a href="#6-Promote-Your-YouTube-Video-or-Channel-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="6. Promote Your YouTube Video or Channel on Social Media"></a>6. Promote Your YouTube Video or Channel on Social Media</h3><p>There are specific odds that your eCommerce business is active on other social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Taking benefit of your audience on other social media platforms to promote your YouTube channel can assist you promptly earning some easy subscribers and allow you better promote your products for the current followers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-about-Unboxing-Videos"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-about-Unboxing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs about Unboxing Videos"></a><strong>Part 4: FAQs about Unboxing Videos</strong></h2><p><strong>1 - What should be included in the unboxing video?</strong></p>
<p>As discussed earlier, you can include products related to your channel’s niche in your unboxing videos.</p>
<p><strong>2 - How long should an unboxing video be?</strong></p>
<p>Time will vary depending on the actual unboxing product, but try to keep it below 5 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>3 - Can you monetize unboxing videos?</strong></p>
<p>No. Text-based commentary isn’t acceptable for monetization. It must be vocal, and for you to show your face as well would be even better.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Unboxing videos are a bang on that; hate them or love them, they are here to stay. Whether you’re a brand owner, a consumer, or both, you’ve probably considered one or two while purposelessly browsing.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-a-Killer-Unboxing-Video-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-a-Killer-Unboxing-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video</strong></h2><p>Firstly, you have to take note of the following points to create the best unboxing videos.</p>
<p>1. Select an Unboxing Niche</p>
<p>2. Practice Speaking Clearly and Slowly</p>
<p>3. Use the Best Unboxing Set-Up</p>
<p>4. Make Sure to Timely Unbox the Products</p>
<p>5. Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p>
<p>6. Show the Product in Use</p>
<p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.</p>
<p>Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p>
<p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-1"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p>
<p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p>
<p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that’s extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.</p>

<h3 id="2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-1"><a href="#2-Prepare-Your-Stage-Photo-Lightbox-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox"></a>2. Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox</h3><p>If you look at some famous unboxing channels listed above, you’ll notice that much of their content is shot in a well-framed space where there isn’t much in the background to disturb them from the product being viewed.</p>
<p>Often, this is a “photo lightbox” or an empty table (a small container with a smooth white backdrop that enhances lighting while reducing shadows for making photos look greater). Lightboxes can also be helpful when you’re taking snapshots of your products to put up on your eCommerce website, so it’s a great idea to make (or buy) one that can fit your products.</p>
<h3 id="3-Practice-Making-Videos-1"><a href="#3-Practice-Making-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Practice Making Videos"></a>3. Practice Making Videos</h3><p>Before uploading videos to YouTube, take some time to practice making your unboxing videos using random items or already-opened products. This way, you can work upon setting up your stage and camera, keeping the product within an aim, narrating your unboxing video, editing footage to reduce the “dead air” where nothing is being done or said, and more!</p>
<p>When you’re over making your first test video, play it back and look for issues like excessive “ums, ahs,” or things that are out of focus and other sentence fillers. Don’t worry if your first video isn’t that great—that’s what practice (and your video editing software) are for!</p>
<h3 id="4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time-1"><a href="#4-Don’t-Waste-Your-Viewers’-Time-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Waste Your Viewers’ Time"></a>4. Don’t Waste Your Viewers’ Time</h3><p>If you want to make the best unboxing videos, ensure that you get to the “unboxing” section quite instantly! As indicated by the Expert Voice: “remember that you compete for viewers’ attention with lots of other video content. Keep your introductions brief and quickly get to the unboxing.” If you take too much time to get to the section of unboxing video, you risk losing your audience’s interest and them going away from your content before you can introduce your product.</p>
<h3 id="5-Compile-Things-Up-Once-in-a-While-1"><a href="#5-Compile-Things-Up-Once-in-a-While-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Compile Things Up Once in a While"></a>5. Compile Things Up Once in a While</h3><p>If you unbox your products, you might instantly run out of content ideas to make. You may look up your YouTube channel losing traction without the new content. So, try to compile things up once in a while—as the Ryan’s World channel discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Creating other kinds of content, such as how-to videos and advice videos for specific products, product updates, and simple news, or even short promotional bits, can help keep your publishing frequency top-notch.</p>
<p>Just remember: everything you publish or post should still be related to your brand and your channel’s core content!</p>
<h3 id="6-Promote-Your-YouTube-Video-or-Channel-on-Social-Media-1"><a href="#6-Promote-Your-YouTube-Video-or-Channel-on-Social-Media-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Promote Your YouTube Video or Channel on Social Media"></a>6. Promote Your YouTube Video or Channel on Social Media</h3><p>There are specific odds that your eCommerce business is active on other social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Taking benefit of your audience on other social media platforms to promote your YouTube channel can assist you promptly earning some easy subscribers and allow you better promote your products for the current followers.</p>

<p>As discussed earlier, you can include products related to your channel’s niche in your unboxing videos.</p>
<p><strong>2 - How long should an unboxing video be?</strong></p>
<p>Time will vary depending on the actual unboxing product, but try to keep it below 5 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>3 - Can you monetize unboxing videos?</strong></p>
<p>No. Text-based commentary isn’t acceptable for monetization. It must be vocal, and for you to show your face as well would be even better.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Unboxing videos are a bang on that; hate them or love them, they are here to stay. Whether you’re a brand owner, a consumer, or both, you’ve probably considered one or two while purposelessly browsing.</p>

<p><strong>Unboxing videos</strong> are a bizarre trend. However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.</p>
<p>And, if you haven’t already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like. At its core, “unboxing” is the procedure of recording the moment when a particular product is removed and opened from the packaging sold in.</p>
<p>Again, you’re probably thinking:</p>
<p>‘Why would anybody gaze at other folks opening their product packaging?’</p>
<p>More than 90,000 people type ‘unboxing’ into YouTube each month, and that’s quite interesting as well as strange. Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll see the science behind such unboxing videos and learn how to create an attractive one by taking inspiration from others.</p>
<p>So whether you’re not sure why we admire unboxing videos or you wish to know how to use them to your benefit, you’re in the right place!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?</strong></h2><p>Within the unboxing videos, people open boxes and narrate their actions. Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.</p>
<p>Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don’t generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-2"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels"></a><strong>Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</strong></h2><p>There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.</p>
<p>Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber’s unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness. So which is the perfect or ideal YouTube channel for unboxing videos for you to try to get featured on? The answer is: “It depends!”</p>
<p>Not every YouTuber is the best for every eCommerce business—and a YouTube channel simply being huge and influential doesn’t make it relevant for your brand. So it’s essential to consider brand suitability while trying looking for a YouTuber to create unboxing videos.</p>
<p>This means considering whether they use harsh language or if their target audience has some overlap with your target audience.</p>
<p>Keeping it in mind, here are some of the top YouTube unboxing channels for inspiration:</p>

Don’t Waste Your Viewers’ Time</h3><p>If you want to make the best unboxing videos, ensure that you get to the “unboxing” section quite instantly! As indicated by the Expert Voice: “remember that you compete for viewers’ attention with lots of other video content. Keep your introductions brief and quickly get to the unboxing.” If you take too much time to get to the section of unboxing video, you risk losing your audience’s interest and them going away from your content before you can introduce your product.</p>

<p>Creating other kinds of content, such as how-to videos and advice videos for specific products, product updates, and simple news, or even short promotional bits, can help keep your publishing frequency top-notch.</p>

<p><strong>Unboxing videos</strong> are a bizarre trend. However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.</p>
<p>And, if you haven’t already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like. At its core, “unboxing” is the procedure of recording the moment when a particular product is removed and opened from the packaging sold in.</p>
<p>Again, you’re probably thinking:</p>
<p>‘Why would anybody gaze at other folks opening their product packaging?’</p>
<p>More than 90,000 people type ‘unboxing’ into YouTube each month, and that’s quite interesting as well as strange. Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll see the science behind such unboxing videos and learn how to create an attractive one by taking inspiration from others.</p>
<p>So whether you’re not sure why we admire unboxing videos or you wish to know how to use them to your benefit, you’re in the right place!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-Unboxing-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?"></a><strong>Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?</strong></h2><p>Within the unboxing videos, people open boxes and narrate their actions. Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.</p>
<p>Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don’t generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-3"><a href="#Part-2-5-Best-YouTube-Unboxing-Channels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels"></a><strong>Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels</strong></h2><p>There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.</p>
<p>Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber’s unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness. So which is the perfect or ideal YouTube channel for unboxing videos for you to try to get featured on? The answer is: “It depends!”</p>
<p>Not every YouTuber is the best for every eCommerce business—and a YouTube channel simply being huge and influential doesn’t make it relevant for your brand. So it’s essential to consider brand suitability while trying looking for a YouTuber to create unboxing videos.</p>
<p>This means considering whether they use harsh language or if their target audience has some overlap with your target audience.</p>
<p>Keeping it in mind, here are some of the top YouTube unboxing channels for inspiration:</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-a-Killer-Unboxing-Video-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-a-Killer-Unboxing-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video"></a><strong>Part 3: How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video</strong></h2><p>Firstly, you have to take note of the following points to create the best unboxing videos.</p>
<p>1. Select an Unboxing Niche</p>
<p>2. Practice Speaking Clearly and Slowly</p>
<p>3. Use the Best Unboxing Set-Up</p>
<p>4. Make Sure to Timely Unbox the Products</p>
<p>5. Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video</p>
<p>6. Show the Product in Use</p>
<p>One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.</p>
<p>Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?</p>
<p>Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-3"><a href="#1-Use-a-Good-Camera-Video-Editing-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software"></a>1. Use a Good Camera &amp; Video Editing Software</h3><p>While you probably don’t require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.</p>
<p>In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don’t have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you’re filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.</p>
<p>On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can’t do with this software! It’s a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.</p>
<p>The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that’s extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.</p>

Prepare Your Stage&#x2F;Photo Lightbox</h3><p>If you look at some famous unboxing channels listed above, you’ll notice that much of their content is shot in a well-framed space where there isn’t much in the background to disturb them from the product being viewed.</p>
<p>Often, this is a “photo lightbox” or an empty table (a small container with a smooth white backdrop that enhances lighting while reducing shadows for making photos look greater). Lightboxes can also be helpful when you’re taking snapshots of your products to put up on your eCommerce website, so it’s a great idea to make (or buy) one that can fit your products.</p>
<h3 id="3-Practice-Making-Videos-3"><a href="#3-Practice-Making-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Practice Making Videos"></a>3. Practice Making Videos</h3><p>Before uploading videos to YouTube, take some time to practice making your unboxing videos using random items or already-opened products. This way, you can work upon setting up your stage and camera, keeping the product within an aim, narrating your unboxing video, editing footage to reduce the “dead air” where nothing is being done or said, and more!</p>
<p>When you’re over making your first test video, play it back and look for issues like excessive “ums, ahs,” or things that are out of focus and other sentence fillers. Don’t worry if your first video isn’t that great—that’s what practice (and your video editing software) are for!</p>
