Before we get into the full episode, let’s start by understanding the definition of .AVI file.

AVI stands for audio video interleave. An AVI is a video container format that capture, store and play audio- videos. The AVI file extensions are abbreviated as .avi.

It was developed by Microsoft in 1992 and works based on Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Its users enjoy built-in support in every Microsoft Windows application.

AVI encodes its audio and video data on codecs like XviD, DivX and MPEG-2\. A codec is a software or hardware used to compress or decompress digital video.

## What is an AVI File?

Before we get into the full episode, let’s start by understanding the definition of .AVI file.

AVI stands for audio video interleave. An AVI is a video container format that capture, store and play audio- videos. The AVI file extensions are abbreviated as .avi.

It was developed by Microsoft in 1992 and works based on Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF). Its users enjoy built-in support in every Microsoft Windows application.

AVI encodes its audio and video data on codecs like XviD, DivX and MPEG-2\. A codec is a software or hardware used to compress or decompress digital video.

#### Solution 3\. Check if Shorts is available in your country

Remember that “Shorts” isn’t available in all the countries yet. So, you can confirm whether it is already in your country. If not, you can bypass GEO restrictions by using free VPNs.

1. First, download and install a VPN app.
2. Next, select the USA or India server location to fake a GPS location.
3. Then clear the cache from the YouTube app and click it open.
4. You should now find the option to view and even upload Shorts from your device.

#### Solution 4\. Ensure your video is set as YouTube Shorts

Your video should be set as YouTube Shorts before posting.

1. Identify the video that you wish to post.
2. Add the “#shorts” in your title and description.
3. See that each video is up to 60 seconds only.
4. Post the video and see whether the issue isn’t reoccurring.
