If you have a YouTube channel, you are one of many content creators competing for viewers’ attention online - a YouTube subscriber boost is a tough thing to manage. The good news is that time spent on YouTube is on the rise around the world. There’s no reason you can’t have a slice of that gigantic pie.

When it comes to [running a successful YouTube channel](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html), it’s all about subscribers. The more subscribers you attract, the more your videos will be viewed and shared online. In fact, YouTube confirms that subscribers watch double the number of videos non-subscribers do. So, getting more people to subscribe to your channel will certainly increase the number of views and engagement your videos get.

It’s no wonder the rate at which channels’ subscribers grow is an important metric in YouTube’s algorithm. The channels with the best rate of subscriber growth get featured. It’s not about suddenly skyrocketing to stardom, though. It’s about consistent growth. So, as a YouTube creator, [growing your subscribers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html) should definitely be a top priority.

There are many tips out there on how to go about [increasing your YouTube subscribers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-top-10-smartest-ways-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-311.html). In this post, we share 4 simple and smart tricks to get the process rolling.

1. [**Make Sure All Your Links Are Subscribe Links**](#links)
2. **[Sort Your Videos Into Playlists](#sort)**
3. [**Create a Channel Trailer or Set a Featured Video**](#trailer)
4. [**Add Your Rivals To Your Tags**](#rivals)

## **1\. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS**

This point is key. By making all your links subscribe links anytime you link to your channel, you make sure that anyone who views your channel is prompted to subscribe. Subscribe links create a pop-up once viewers reach your channel. It’s a bold move that can give you instant results especially if you are referring traffic to your YouTube channel from other social media platforms.

All you need do is add ‘_?sub\_confirmation=1_’ at the end of all your YouTube links and there’ll be a pop-up whenever people click.

Now, it’s true that YouTube’s subscribe button isn’t exactly hidden. The bright red subscribe button can be found beneath all videos and at the top right side of every channel’s homepage. However, including your own subscribe link (via a YouTube card or in your video’s description) allows you to write a message that creates a sense of urgency which can produce fast results especially when people are really interested in watching your videos.

## **2\. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS**

Playlists have long been a part of our entertainment experience. Whether on our iPods or via apps like SoundCloud or Spotify, playlists make it easy for us to find and access the kind of content we like. But playlists aren’t just for music. [Creating playlists on your YouTube channel](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html) is a very smart move. It gives your subscribers and viewers added value they will appreciate. Part of the hassle of being online these days is trying to find the content you actually want to consume because you have to wade through so much content you aren’t actually interested in. By taking the work out of finding related content, you actually increase the chances that your viewers will stay longer on your channel and watch more of your videos.

You can also create playlists to curate content by other YouTube creators. As long as your curated content falls within your chosen category, and also complements your channel, you should go for it. In a way, creating curated playlists makes it easier to convince non-subscribed viewers that you understand the sort of content they like, and your channel is one to watch. Seeing that you know the best content and creators for a particular topic might just be the thing that convinces non-subscribed viewers to sign-on to receive updates from your channel.

## **3\. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO**

Most dedicated YouTube creators have made [channel trailers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It’s their chance to give visitors a taste of what they’re all about in a short and exciting video. YouTube trailers are a sure way to hook viewers and you should definitely make one if you want to increase your channel subscribers fast.

YouTube channel trailers are usually under a minute long. In less than 60 seconds, you can showcase your best videos and get viewers excited about what you have to offer. You may choose to employ the sorts of clever videography we see in movie trailers. With so many open source and free video editing programs, doing this is actually not as difficult as you might think. The bottom line is that a YouTube trailer can be a creative and effective way of creating buzz about your channel and ultimately, growing your subscribers.

That said, you don’t have to make a YouTube channel trailer if you don’t want to. Setting a featured video can be just as effective. Featuring your most popular video will make a b first impression on people who visit your channel and increase the likelihood that they’ll click the subscribe button. Featuring your most recent video will keep your channel looking fresh.

## **4\. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS**

Adding your rival's names to your tags might sound a bit underhanded, but it’s a fair way of increasing the chances that your content will show up as related to theirs. The trick is to choose rivals whose content ranks highest for the category or group related to your own content.

To find your rivals, simply search for your video titles. If your video is very popular and you’ve optimized it well enough, it may rank tops in your search. In most cases, however, the search results will show someone else’s content at the top of the list. Adding the names of the top 3 creators on that search list to your video’s tags will increase the likelihood that your video will be presented to viewers as related to theirs. When your video shows up as related to a top-ranking video, the chance that it will be viewed is increased significantly. And in addition, the more you are seen to create content that’s similar to the best videos, the more viewers are likely to subscribe to your channel.

## **CONCLUSION**

The tips on this list are simple, straightforward, and sure to deliver results. If you want a YouTube subscriber boost, you’d better be smart about it!

For macOS 10.12 or later

**Step 1: Define Project Settings and Add Image to the Timeline**

Launch Wondershare Filmora X on your PC (a MacBook Pro M1 is used here), ensure that the project aspect ratio is set to **16:9 (Widescreen)** on the splash screen, and click **New Project**. On the main interface, click the **Preview quality and display settings** icon from the upper-right area of the Timeline, click **Change Project Aspect Ratio**, click to select **1280 x 720 (HD)** from the **Resolution** menu of the **Project Settings** box, and click **OK** to save the custom project settings.

![Filmora Mac start interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-mac-start-interface.jpg)

Then select **My Media** from the menu bar if not already selected, click **Project Media** from the navigation pane, and click **Import** from the **Media** box to select and import the image of the main character or object that you want to use in the thumbnail.

![Import videos to Filmora  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-change-aspect-ratio-filmora.jpg)

Now, drag the image from the **Media** box to the Timeline at the bottom.

**Step 2: Clear Image Background, Add Border, and Add Custom Background**

Go to **Effects** from the menu bar, click to select the **Default** tab and then **AI Portrait** from the navigation pane, and click and drag the **Human Segmentation** preset from the right box, and place it over the image track in the Timeline.

![add human segmentation effect to youtube thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-human-segmentation-remove-background.jpg)

Double-click the image layer, scroll down the upper-left box to the **Video Effects** section, and use the **Edge Thickness** and **Edge Feather** sliders to adjust the character’s edges to make them as realistic as possible. Click **OK** when done.

![adjust thumbnail border settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-border-settings.jpg)

Next, click and drag the **Human Border** preset over the image track in the Timeline, and follow the same procedure to customize the border. This will give the character a **neon border** effect.

![adjust thumbnail border settings ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-human-border-effects.jpg)

Now, use the method explained earlier to import a custom image for the background, and drag and place it under the previous track in the Timeline.

![adjust border to photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-photo-to-border.jpg)

If you are running the latest version of Filmora, you will find there are some neon light effects available under AI Portrait as well.

Go to **Titles** from the menu bar, click to select the **Default** tab and then **Lower 3rds** from the navigation pane, and click and drag your preferred lower-third preset from the right window to a separate layer in the Timeline. Double-click the lower-third layer, and use the available options in the upper-left window to change the text, its color, etc., and drag the textbox to place it to your preferred position on the image as well. Click **OK** to save the changes.

Next, click to select **Titles** from the navigation pane, and drag your preferred title from the right window to the upper-most track in the Timeline. Now use the method explained earlier to edit the text, its color, position, etc. to make it look professional.

## Part 2: How to Add a Glowing Neon Border in Your YouTube Thumbnail with Canva

Canva is another intuitive editing program that works on the web interface rather than having you download and install an app on your PC. You can add a **neon border** for YouTube thumbnails using Canva by following the instructions given below:

**Step 1: Define Project Settings and Add a Background**

After signing in to your Canva account, click **Create a design** from the top-right corner of the page, click **Custom size** from the bottom, define **1280** and **720** in the **Width** and **Height** fields on the box that appears respectively, and click **Create new design**.

![add neon border to thumbnail in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-neon-border-canva.jpg)

Now, click to select **Background** from the navigation bar on the left (if the **Background** tool is not visible, click **More** and then choose **Background** from the expanded list), and click to select a background from the images available in the center pane.

![ choose background in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-choose-background.jpg)

**Step 2: Upload an Image and Add Effects**

Click **Uploads** from the navigation bar, click the **More** icon from the right of the **Upload media** button present at the top of the center pane, choose your preferred method to upload the image (with the transparent background) that you want to use, upload the image, and drag it from the center pane to the Canvas.

**Note:** You can use any of the tools available online to remove the background from your image for free.

![upload thumbnail in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-youtube-thumbnail-canva.jpg)

To add a **YouTube thumbnail border**, make sure that the image that you added to the Canvas is selected, click the **Duplicate** icon from the upper-right area, and use the scaling handles of the copy of the image to increase its size a bit. Reposition the image back to its original location as well.

Then, click **Edit image** from the upper-left corner of the Canvas, click **Duotone** from the **Edit image** pane at the center, if need be, click **See all**, choose your preferred duotone effect to apply on the image, choose your preferred highlight and shadow colors from the box that appears next, and click **Back** from the top of the pane.

![Canva edit image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-edit-image-duotone.jpg)

Next, click **See all** next to the **Adjust** section from the center pane, and drag the **Blur** slider to the right to increase the blur effect on the image.

![blur thumbnail image in Canva  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-thumbnail-canva.jpg)

**Step 3: Position the Layers**

While keeping the duplicate image selected, click the **Position** button from the upper-right area of the Canvas, and click **Background** to send the second image behind the first one to get the **neon border** effect for the photo.

## Part 3: How to Outline a Person in a YouTube Thumbnail with Photoshop

Because YouTube thumbnails are nothing but static images, creating **YouTube thumbnail border** with Adobe Photoshop is comparatively easier. The process of doing this is given below:

**Step 1: Define Document Preferences and Import an Image**

Launch Adobe Photoshop on your PC, click **Create new**, and on the **New Document** customization box, define the width and height values to **1280** and **720** pixels respectively. Select **Transparent** from the **Background Contents** menu as well if not already selected. Click **Create** from the bottom to create a new Photoshop document with the specified document settings. Next, open the folder that contains the source image, drag the photo to Photoshop, and press **Enter** to place the photo.

![import thumbnail image to ps  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-youtube-thumbnail-photoshop.jpg)

**Step 2: Remove Background from the Image**

Make sure that the image layer is selected in the **Layers** panel on the right, go to **Select** from the menu bar at the top, and click **Subject**. From the bottom of the **Layers** panel, click the **Add a mask** icon to get rid of the background, leaving only the human on the Canvas.

![remove thumbnail background in ps  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-thumbnail-background.jpg)

**Step 3: Add a Custom Background and an Outline Around the Subject**

Use the method explained earlier to import a background image of your choice to Photoshop. Drag the background image layer to the bottom in the **Layers** panel. Double-click the masked layer, click to select **Stroke** from the left pane of the **Layer Style** box, and use the options available on the right to manage the size, color, position, etc. of the stroke that has been added around the human subject. Click **OK** when done, and then export the image normally to use it as a **YouTube thumbnail border**.
