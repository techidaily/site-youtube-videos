![filmora add frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-add-frame.jpg)

Step16 Select the snapshot format and storage path. The snapshot will appear in the media library.

![filmora save location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-05.png)

Step17 Right-click on the snapshot and **select** "**Reveal in Explorer**" to find the file on your computer. You can now use it as your Valorant thumbnail.

![filmora find snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-find-snapshot.jpg)

## Tips for Making Awesome Thumbnails for Your YouTube Valorant Videos

By following these tips, you can create an eye-catching and effective thumbnail for your Valorant YouTube videos that will help boost your views and engagement.

* **Use high-quality images and graphics:** A thumbnail with low-quality or pixelated images will not be as effective as a thumbnail with clear, high-resolution graphics.
* **Use bold, eye-catching colors:** Bright colors can help your thumbnail stand out in a crowded feed.
* **Include relevant text:** Use text to give viewers an idea of what to expect from your video and to entice them to click.
* **Use clear, legible fonts:** Make sure the text on your thumbnail is easy to read and doesn't distract from the overall design.
* **Keep it simple:** Avoid overcrowding your thumbnail with too many elements or text. A clean, simple design is often more effective.
* **Make it relevant:** Your thumbnail should accurately represent the content of your video.
* **Test different designs:** Be bold and experiment with design elements and layouts to find what works best for your brand.
