YouTube CC can easily bring more viewers to your terminal. But not all users know how to turn it on or bother to turn it on when it can actually help improve the watching experience. So there are few benefits that you can enjoy by having CCs ALWAYS on your videos.

In such cases, YouTube subtitles help viewers to understand what is going on videos even if they cannot hear it.

\- This feature makes videos more accessible and can also appear useful for viewers that are hearing impaired.
