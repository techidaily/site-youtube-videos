Now that you know how to stream on Twitch and YouTube, here are some tips to improve your live streams!

### Tip # 1: Enhance Your Content

You can enhance your content in multiple ways to grasp a wider audience and get your message all around the globe.

### Tip # 2: Introduce Graphics and Transitions

You can use interesting gifs, screens, intros, and outros for your streams. Announcing your streams beforehand can also help build up hype and make people anticipate your feed.

### Tip # 3: Work More on Post Production

People stream different content on these streaming platforms including gaming, podcasts, educational and entertainment videos. Editing your content to near perfection is one of the most major aspects of a successful broadcast.

### Tip # 4: Use Editing Tools to Make Your Videos Interesting

You can use different editing tools such as Wondershare Filmora which is a great video editing software that allows you to edit, trim, cut, add sounds and apply tons of effects to your content no matter what type or genre it is.

### Tip # 5: Add Certain Effects to Appear Professional

You can also introduce motion tracking, keyframing, and use other powerful features, and that too for free using Wondershare Filmora. However, if you wish to go a step further you can always opt for their premium version and transcend into a world of endless options and opportunities to edit and enhance your content.

### Tip # 6: Promote Your Content Using Social Media

Multi-streaming helps build up a wider community of fans as it is targeting different sets of people and you can also earn from your streams using advertisements and introducing click-on banners for brand endorsements.

Some platforms also let you promote and manage your merchandise, so it is always a good opportunity for these streaming clients and platforms.

## Conclusion

Now you can also monetize your streams and broadcast on different platforms such as YouTube and Twitch at the same time. This will boost your reach and views in a very positive way. You can also tweak your content by editing it and inserting sound effects, gifs, and much more to make it more interesting and catchier.

And by multi-streaming on YouTube and Twitch, you will have a greater chance of being found by gaming sponsors and your growth will not be tied just to a single platform. You can also promote your streams on other social media platforms and your handles as well.

Pre-recorded videos are also a great way to present your content with perfection without any chances of being prone to any potential online mishaps.
