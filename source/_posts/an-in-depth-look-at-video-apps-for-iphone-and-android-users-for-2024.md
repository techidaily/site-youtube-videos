##### Canva

![canva news outros templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/canva-news-outros-templates.jpg)

With a wide range of templates to choose from, you can easily find one that fits your needs and style. Best of all, you can create your outro template in minutes without hiring a designer or spending hours learning complex design software.

The software is easy-to-use and does not require any editor to customize and use the templates. The paid version is divided into 2 tiers: Canva Pro **($54.99 per year**) and Canva for team (**$84\. 90/year)**. One disadvantage of the Canva free version is that it is limited resolution options when exporting your file.

##### Flexclip

[Flexclip](https://www.flexclip.com/template/?search=news%20outro)is a free, powerful, and easy-to-use online video maker that helps you create beautiful and engaging content for your business.

![flexclip news outros templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/flexclip-news-outros-templates.jpg)

You can add text, music, elements, overlays, and branding to your templates to make them more stunning and captivating.

The platform offers 3 paid plans starting at **$8.99/month.** The con here is that the free version is only limited to the export quality of 480p, single royalty-free stock use, and 12 projects limit.

##### Placeit

[Placeit](https://placeit.net/?search=news+outros) is an online editor giving you the ability to create and customize your video content in no time. The editor also includes a stock image library, giving you access to several customizable templates.

![placeit video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/placeit-video-editor.jpg)

Placeit is easy to use and offers a variety of templates for different purposes, including outros for news stories, video blogs, and even gaming videos. The platform offers an unlimited subscription plan starting from **$7.47 /month.**

However, the design rendering process of the editor is slow, there is no AI tool, and you even cannot import fonts that are not available on the platform.

### Non-Editable News Outro Template Websites

Some platforms offer non-editable high-resolution news outros that you can integrate into your videos using software programs like [Filmora (guidance in Part 3),](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FEdit) After Effects, etc.

##### Storyblock

Searching for high-quality templates for your next project?[Storyblock](https://www.storyblocks.com/video/search/news+outros) is a website that comes with royalty-free, non-customizable news style outros.

![storyblock news outros templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/storyblock-news-outros-templates.jpg)

You can use these templates to create high-quality news intros and outros for your podcast or videos. The platform offers two pricing plans for individual content creators, starting at **$15** per month. While businesses can customize their plans as per their requirements.

Limitations of the Storyblock are that the footage quality is very poor in the free version, and the paid versions might be tricky to avail sometimes.

##### Videvo

[Videvo](https://www.videvo.net/search/news%20outros/) is a great resource for anyone looking for royalty-free video templates. They have over 300,000 free and premium videos, which you can download in clips or full with 4K resolution. However, their stock library is not much vast. The platform comes with a two-tier subscription plan starting from **$14.99/month** or **$144/year.**

![videvo news outros templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/videvo-news-outros-templates.jpg)

You can find templates for both commercial and non-commercial use, so whatever your needs are, Videvo is likely to have a template that will work for you, i.e., news style. Some features of the platform include high-resolution download options, numerous music, sound effects, images and videos library, and a video compression option.

##### Videezy

[Videezy](https://www.videezy.com/free-video/news-outros) is a royalty-free video site that offers free and premium video templates. The website has a variety of options to choose from, including news style outros, all of which are geared towards creating engaging content.

The templates are all ready-made and royalty-free. You can download them for use in your own projects and attach them to your video using any video editing app/software.

The pricing of the platform starts at **$19/file**, which might be expensive for some users. Moreover, in the free version, too many ads are displayed.

![shutterstock news outros templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shutterstock-news-outros-templates.jpg)

On Shutterstock, the free trial only offers 10 images, and you will be charged **$0.22-$14.50/image** once the trial limit is over. On the other hand, the Extended license will cost you **$67.96-$99.50.** The downside is that you have to purchase the content pack separately.

##### iStock
