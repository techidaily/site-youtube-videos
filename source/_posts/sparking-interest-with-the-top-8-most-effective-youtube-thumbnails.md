A YouTube thumbnail must be made very engaging and attractive to tell the potential viewers what the video is about and make them watch it. Since YouTube is a visual media platform, viewers set their eyes on the thumbnails first before they read the title of the video. If you’ve made a collage of YouTube thumbnails or designed YouTube channel art containing various freeze-frame images from different YouTube videos, you are no stranger to needing a fast way to collect YouTube thumbnail images. Online, there are several tools dedicated to solving this exact problem. These are the top five YouTube Thumbnail grabbers:

These thumbnails can be then be used in videos, blogs, articles, web pages, etc. Let’s have a look at 8 best thumbnail grabbers in the market:

3. [Thumbnailsave.com](#youtubegrabber3)
4. [Get YouTube Thumbnail](#youtubegrabber4)
5. [Fbutube.com](#youtubegrabber5)
