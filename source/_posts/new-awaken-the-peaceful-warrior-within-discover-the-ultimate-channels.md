Most practitioners now practice yoga from home and so do the instructors. Here are a few tips on how to start your own yoga channel on YouTube.

### Tip 1\. Set your target audience

There are different levels of yoga practitioners as well as their lifestyle. A working mom may give you 10 minutes from her morning routine while a college-going student can give you 10 minutes in the afternoon. Hence, first you need to set your target audience and create your content based on that.

### Tip 2\. Upload videos as scheduled

As you are instructing yoga through your YouTube channel, you need to keep your audience updated. A good way to keep them updated is creating a schedule to upload videos on a regular basis. You can also post the schedule on the description of your channel so that your audience waits for the next.

### Tip 3\. Brand the practice

Creating a brand out of yoga practicing is the next thing you can do. When people hear the name of your YouTube channel, they value it for its brand. Make it just like this. It can be under your name or your studio’s name. Nevertheless, it should propose a brand value.

### Tip 4\. Rank on SEO

The present era is full of competition. If you cannot rank among the top ones, you cannot actually get to the audience and make a business out of it. Hence, you should learn to rank on search engine optimization so that people interested in yoga get to your first.

### Tip 5\. Proper video editing

Promoting your content through videos on YouTube channel is not like doing it in person. So you need to make sure that your videos exert a similar experience as that of reality.

## Part 3: How to Start Your Own Yoga Channel on YouTube?

Just a few years back, yoga was practiced and instructed only in studios. Yoga instructors would visit studios after studios to instruct the practitioners. But the time has changed now. Most practitioners now practice yoga from home and so do the instructors. Here are a few tips on how to start your own yoga channel on YouTube.

### Tip 1\. Set your target audience

There are different levels of yoga practitioners as well as their lifestyle. A working mom may give you 10 minutes from her morning routine while a college-going student can give you 10 minutes in the afternoon. Hence, first you need to set your target audience and create your content based on that.

### Tip 2\. Upload videos as scheduled

As you are instructing yoga through your YouTube channel, you need to keep your audience updated. A good way to keep them updated is creating a schedule to upload videos on a regular basis. You can also post the schedule on the description of your channel so that your audience waits for the next.

### Tip 3\. Brand the practice

Creating a brand out of yoga practicing is the next thing you can do. When people hear the name of your YouTube channel, they value it for its brand. Make it just like this. It can be under your name or your studio’s name. Nevertheless, it should propose a brand value.

### Tip 4\. Rank on SEO

The present era is full of competition. If you cannot rank among the top ones, you cannot actually get to the audience and make a business out of it. Hence, you should learn to rank on search engine optimization so that people interested in yoga get to your first.

### Tip 5\. Proper video editing

Promoting your content through videos on YouTube channel is not like doing it in person. So you need to make sure that your videos exert a similar experience as that of reality. A good initiative towards that is expert video editing. Being one of the best video editors available, Filmora can help you in this case. Also, it allows you to edit videos with minimal effort. Therefore, you can concentrate enough on your actual content- yoga.

### Tip 6\. Collaboration with other channels

Time to time, you can collaborate with other channels to have a ‘shared audience’ who can later turn into your dedicated audience. Nevertheless, it is a no-harm method that you can try to increase traffic to your best yoga YouTube channel.

### Conclusion

The best yoga YouTube channels are not only about the yoga material. It also involves how you draw traffic to your channel, the level of your video editing, and so many more. Hopefully, you will find the tips helpful while creating your own yoga YouTube channel.

## The Social Media Symphony: Composing Jake Paul's YouTube Success

# Jake Paul's YouTube Success Story - All You Need to Know

There is a lot to learn about YouTube success from Jake Paul. With more than 300 hours of video uploaded onto YouTube every minute by more than ten million content creators, standing out from the competition and becoming a YouTube star can seem impossible. But, Jake Paul managed to achieve that in a short amount of time.

### How Old Is Jake Paul?

Twenty-three-year-old Jake Joseph Paul was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the U.S. on January 17, 1997, to realtor father Greg Paul and nurse mother, Pam Stepnick.

### Logan Paul and Jake Paul

He and his older brother, Logan, grew up in Westlake, Ohio, and played a lot of football together growing up. Jake's childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.

Jake's favorite YouTube channel at the time was "Smosh," featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, "Zoosh" (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.

For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school's varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.

But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).

![jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-his-brother-logan-paul.jpg)

Image resource: [BBC NEWS](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42548207/logan-and-jake-paul-the-brothers-dominating-social-media)

Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.

Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.

### Jake Paul and Disney

Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Jake auditioned for Disney Channel's comedy series "Bizaardvark" and successfully landed the role of "Dirk." However, the Disney Channel grew more and more uncomfortable with Jake's growing image as an outrageous teenager. After Jake made it onto the KTLA 5 news for the noise complaints around his mansion, the Disney Channel fired him from Bizaardvark.

### Team 10

In 2016, with all of his many exciting experiences, Jake put together a humorous and motivational memoir titled "You Gotta Want It." As his own social media channels kept on growing rapidly, Jake launched "**Team 10**," his own influencer management agency comprised of other teen social media influencers. In order to collaborate with one another more easily, they all moved in together to a Beverly Grove mansion that rents for $17,000 USD a month. After Jake publicized his address, the mansion attracted so many fans that neighbors filed multiple noise complaints and even contemplated filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Jake.

More than a home, the mansion became a film set. The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.

![Jake Paul and Team 10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jake-paul-and-team-10.jpg.jpg)

Image resource:venturebeat.com

On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled "It's **Everyday Bro**." While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video's success.

As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to "It's Everyday Bro," mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own "diss track" music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.

Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.

## **What About Social Media Success Can We Learn From Jake Paul?**

**[Quick Follower Growth](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Through First-Mover Advantage**

When a new social media service pops up, there's so much opportunity to quickly rack up a huge number of followers simply by being one of the early content creators on that platform. This was the case for the Paul brothers on Vine. After the fall of Vine, the Paul brothers were able to migrate their Vine fans over to YouTube.

**[Know Your Audience](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

Jake has a very good understanding of who his audience is. He knows that his audience is young. By knowing the age group that the majority of his audience falls under, Jake is then able to tailor his content in a way that captures his audience's attention most effectively. Through high-energy prank videos and daring stunts, Jake is able to supply his audience with the content that they want. As a YouTuber, you can get an idea of who your main audience is by accessing your channel's analytics.

**Commitment To Consistent Delivery of Audience-Centered Content**

Jake made a serious commitment to delivering audience-centered content. Jake moved into a house full of other teenagers also committed to content creation, and they all filmed themselves doing pranks and stunts every day.

Twenty-three-year-old Jake Joseph Paul was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the U.S. on January 17, 1997, to realtor father Greg Paul and nurse mother, Pam Stepnick.

### Logan Paul and Jake Paul

He and his older brother, Logan, grew up in Westlake, Ohio, and played a lot of football together growing up. Jake's childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.

Jake's favorite YouTube channel at the time was "Smosh," featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, "Zoosh" (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.

For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school's varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.

But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).

Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.

Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.

### Jake Paul and Disney

Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Jake auditioned for Disney Channel's comedy series "Bizaardvark" and successfully landed the role of "Dirk." However, the Disney Channel grew more and more uncomfortable with Jake's growing image as an outrageous teenager. After Jake made it onto the KTLA 5 news for the noise complaints around his mansion, the Disney Channel fired him from Bizaardvark.

### Team 10

In 2016, with all of his many exciting experiences, Jake put together a humorous and motivational memoir titled "You Gotta Want It." As his own social media channels kept on growing rapidly, Jake launched "**Team 10**," his own influencer management agency comprised of other teen social media influencers. In order to collaborate with one another more easily, they all moved in together to a Beverly Grove mansion that rents for $17,000 USD a month. After Jake publicized his address, the mansion attracted so many fans that neighbors filed multiple noise complaints and even contemplated filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Jake.

More than a home, the mansion became a film set. The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.

On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled "It's **Everyday Bro**." While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video's success.

As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to "It's Everyday Bro," mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own "diss track" music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.

Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.
