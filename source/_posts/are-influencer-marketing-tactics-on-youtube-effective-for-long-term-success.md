| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| ![Canon M50](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The EOS M50 has been on the market for just a few months and it is already regarded as one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. Its 24.1 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor are improved versions of those in the Canon EOS M100 model. With the Canon EOS M50, you can crank up the ISO sensitivity to 51200.

| ![Panasonic GH5S](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png)   | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic's GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That's why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera's 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |

| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| ![Canon M50](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The EOS M50 has been on the market for just a few months and it is already regarded as one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. Its 24.1 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor are improved versions of those in the Canon EOS M100 model. With the Canon EOS M50, you can crank up the ISO sensitivity to 51200.

| ![Panasonic GH5S](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png)   | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic's GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That's why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera's 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |

| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| ![Canon M50](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-1.png)        | Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The EOS M50 has been on the market for just a few months and it is already regarded as one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. Its 24.1 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 Image Processor are improved versions of those in the Canon EOS M100 model. With the Canon EOS M50, you can crank up the ISO sensitivity to 51200.

| ![Panasonic GH5S](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-2.png)   | Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S The Panasonic's GH series was made famous by the LUMIX DMC-GH4 model that will be remembered as the world's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera to offer the 4K video recording option. That's why it comes as no surprise that the GH5S mirrorless micro four-thirds camera can record UHD 4K as well as DCI videos at 60 fps, and 150 Mbps. The full HD 1080p at 240 fps video recording option is also available if you want to capture slow-motion footage for your vlogs. The camera's 10.28MP multi-aspect ratio MOS sensor enhances its low-light performance and produces high-quality videos even under very challenging lighting conditions. Recording the audio with an external microphone is one of the many advantages offered by the Lumix DC-GH5S, while the Advanced Depth-From-Focus technology is used to automatically focus the video in a fraction of a second. The GH5S’ touchscreen can be rotated in any direction, so you can clearly see your shot no matter where you are. There's very little doubt that the GH5S is the best professional-level mirrorless camera for vlogging that will help you capture stunning vlogs.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800_ _\- High video bit rates_   **CONS** _\- Expensive_ _\- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs_ |

The SL2 also has a microphone jack you can connect an external microphone too for better audio.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-11.png)       | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is a feature-rich, mid-range DSLR camera great for vlogging. The 80D lets you capture full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It doesn't provide support for 4K videos, though. The ISO on this camera can be set up to 25600\. The 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the DIGIC 6 image processor reduce the need for high ISO values, though, as they enable the camera to capture visually stunning footage even when the light in the shot is far from perfect. The 80D's 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and its dual pixel CMOS AF system enable you to produce sharp images without having to pull-focus yourself. The various-angle 3-inch 1.04M-dot ClearView II LCD touchscreen display, as well as the pentaprism type intelligent viewfinder, let you compose shots effortlessly.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-5.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The Canon EOS 6D Mark II is the best professional DSLR camera for vlogging. It is the only DSLR camera on the market (as of writing this review) that comes with a full-frame sensor along with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. The camera’s 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor can take in much more light, giving you the option to shoot with higher quality bokeh (unfocused areas appearing more blurry) and find focus much more quickly and accurately in more challenging lighting conditions. With this camera, you can shoot up to full HD 1080p videos at a maximum of 60 fps. Although the 6D Mark II comes with the same 45-point all cross-type autofocusing system as Canon’s crop sensor 80D camera, the 6D Mark II is equipped with the improved DIGIC 7 image processor unlike the 80D’s DIGIC 6 image processor. If you’re wanting to shoot your vlogs with a full-frame, The 6D Mark II is a great option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
