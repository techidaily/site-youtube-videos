Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:

Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:

03 [Where Can I Buy YouTube Likes](#part3)

## The Importance of YouTube Likes

Increasing the number of likes on Your YouTube channel helps it grow in several ways. These include:

#### \- Improves the Ranking of Your YouTube Channel

The number of views and engagement can affect your ranking on YouTube because YouTube's algorithm recommends popular content to users. The algorithm uses user engagement, the number of likes, comments, and views to recommend your content to other people.

By increasing the number of YouTube views and engagement on your YouTube channel, your content will rank higher.

#### \- Helps Increase the Number of Your Subscribers

After creating your YouTube channel, you'll focus on getting subscribers. But It can take a long period to get subscribers if you're still new to YouTube. However, if you get more views on your YouTube videos, more people will easily find your channel.

![the importance of youtube likes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/buy-youtube-likes-1.png)

#### \- Make Your Videos Go Viral

Getting popular on YouTube takes time: You have to upload high-quality videos regularly and increase engagement on your videos. YouTube likes can help you get popular and make your videos go viral.

#### \- Help You Build Credibility

Viewers like watching YouTube videos with many likes. If your YouTube channel is still new, getting more likes can help you build your credibility. In turn, this will help you to grow your channel.

## Can I Buy YouTube Likes?

Yes. You can buy YouTube likes to improve your level of engagement on the platform and get more traffic to your YouTube channel. You will also get more subscribers and give your YouTube videos the social proof they need to convince people about the quality of your content. No one likes being the first person to watch a video. However, when they see other people doing it, they will also want to watch the video.

When you buy YouTube likes, it can also help you stay ahead of the competition or level the playing field. In turn, this will help you to get more people to subscribe to your channel.

#### Does Buying YouTube Likes Help Boost Your Channel?

When you buy YouTube likes, you give your YouTube channel a head start to be more noticeable in your niche. From there, you can now attract a larger organic audience and build your community from organic audience to build your channel. To ensure people watch your videos, you need to ensure they are high quality. Filmora helps you edit quality videos; it allows you to enhance the quality of your video by adjusting the hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, rotate, and trim your videos to make them look professional.

Additionally, you can apply several filters and fine-tune the images of your videos. Before saving your video, you can choose the high-quality video (NTSC) option to ensure it has the highest quality. What's more? You can adjust the quality of your audio, as the software allows you to adjust fade in, fade out, output volume, and pitch.

#### Is It Legal to Buy YouTube Likes?

It's not illegal to buy YouTube views in any form, shape, or way. However, you have to keep in mind that YouTube does not allow using artificial means to increase the number of likes.

## Where Can I Buy YouTube Likes

There are lots of places you can buy likes for your YouTube videos. Most of them are safe to use, while some are dodgy bot farms. While buying real YouTube is essential, knowing reputable and reliable sellers is crucial. There are several signs of credibility you should look out for to find the right services. They include:

* Secure website: The site you are buying views should have an SSL certificate.
* Reputable payment gateway: Make sure the site uses safe payment methods like Apple Pay and major credit cards.
* Genuine users. Only buy YouTube views from real YouTube users.
* Customer service. The service you choose should have responsive customer support available around the clock to help its customers when they need assistance.
* Anonymity: The best services keep things anonymous when growing your video engagement to protect your YouTube account.
* Real Testimonials: Check the testimonials on their site and confirm they are genuine. </li

#### Can I Buy YouTube Dislikes?

Yes. You can buy YouTube dislikes online. You need to purchase dislikes because they are part of engagement on YouTube. If your video has both dislikes and likes, its chances of ranking higher increase significantly. Dislikes make your video appear more realistic to viewers.

#### The Price of Buying YouTube Likes

Lots of companies offer affordable rates for buying YouTube likes. The exact amount you have to pay depends on the number of YouTube likes you want. You can buy 50 YouTube likes for $4 to 6, depending on the service provider you use. The price of 1000 likes is around $100.

#### Can the Service Provider Take Back their YouTube likes After Selling them to Me?

No. After a service provider has sent out the likes, they don't have a way to take them back. If you notice your YouTube likes are reducing, they could be fake likes. YouTube does not like fake likes, so they take them away if they find them on your videos. That is why you must only buy likes from reliable service providers.
