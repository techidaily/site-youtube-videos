What matters is that you get 1,000 subscribers to enable you to monetize on YouTube. However, YouTube also has its measures in place, and manipulating the matrix is one of which they don’t advocate for. But in most cases, subforsub participants operate fake YouTube accounts and you can find one person corresponding up to 5 accounts to gain subscriptions. This isn’t good for your rating as you don’t get real subscribers but you only boost the number of subscribers. And since they don’t watch your videos, neither will they share them with other viewers.

## Tips & tricks to use sub for sub

Subforsub isn’t genuine and all you get is bot subscribers who don’t engage. However, you can use available tricks to gain popularity.

#### \- Using fake accounts

![youtube sub for sub - use fake account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-2.png)

A user should only run one genuine YouTube account. However, the trick that most subscribers use to gain more subs is by creating other additional fake accounts to gain more subs in return. But again, it is not a guarantee as some subscribers may not sub back to all the accounts.

#### \- Subscribers don’t watch the videos

Perhaps there is no time for subscribers to watch the potential sub videos before subscribing. Your mission is to gain as many subs as possible even if your watch time doesn’t go up. This doesn’t bring any positivity to your channel rather an increased number of subscribers.

#### \- Reach out to friends

![youtube sub for sub - reach out to friends](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-3.png)

You can also boost your sub for sub by reaching out to friends to inform them of your channel and ask for subscriptions in return for theirs as well. This, however, could be a slow process as not all your friends will be attracted to what you do.

#### \- Don’t do subforsub for followers

A subforsub may not give you followers parse. So, don’t get into it for genuine followers. Those who sub to your channel won’t follow you in most cases. Rather, they might unsubscribe after a short duration of time.

#### \- Use channel branding

This trick will glue viewers to your channel. These can include banner art to welcome everyone who clicks into your channel.

## Additional thoughts - Should we rely on subforsub to get more subscribers?

You should not rely on subforsub as it doesn’t give the real figures but manipulates the outcome. Nonetheless, you need real subscribers to climb the YouTube ladder. That’s the best way to push the YouTube algorithm. There are genuine aspects of gaining subscribers to grow your channel.

#### Get to social media platforms

![youtube sub for sub - look for subscriber on social platform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-4.png)

These include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other sites. Introduce your YouTube channel to your followers and remind them to subscribe. Likewise, demonstrate why your channel is worth subscribing to.

#### Upload content consistently

Ensure your upload schedule is consistent and you’ll see viewers having a reason to subscribe to your channel. Once you introduce your channel with the first video, post a second and third video to build more momentum on your potential subscribers.

#### Incorporate YouTube stories

![take advantage of youtube stories to get more subscriber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-5.png)

Stories can be a good starting point for those who have not subscribed to your content yet despite watching. Short video stories will attract viewers’ attention and want to get more from your channel.

#### Use Calls to Action

![cta to get more youtube subscriber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-6.png)

Ask your audience to subscribe after watching your videos. A great idea is to use animation or graphics to attract the viewers’ attention instantly. Other free options like green screen are also available for use.

#### Make it easy for viewers to understand your channel

You can make it easy by giving your viewers a guided tour. By this, they’ll know where to find important sections like comments. You can also create a channel banner that tells your audience what you do. They’ll soon familiarize themselves with your channel and be friends in no time.

#### Build a relationship with your audience

It is good to connect with your audience in various aspects. Expressing yourself probably in front of a camera has a deeper impact. You can also use illustrations to bring out your points for a quick understanding. Engaging them in the process is the best way to make them feel like they belong and eventually turn into subscribers.

#### Focus on the video that’s working for you

You should know which video is working and which is not. Judge and put more emphasis on the video that’s working for you. Check out which videos turn viewers into subscribers as that’s your main aim. More so, be creative and innovative.

## 11 Useful YouTube SEO Tips to Help Boost Your Video Ranking

Want to drive more traffic and increase your video views? Here are eleven YouTube SEO tips that will help you to boost your video ranking.

#### 1\. Conduct Keyword Research First

![youtube seo tips - conduct keywords reseaerch first](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-1.png)

When it comes to YouTube SEO, keywords are crucial. YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.

For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.

#### 2\. Use a Good Video Title

![youtube seo tips - video title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-2.png)

The title of your video is the first thing other people see, and it's what decides whether or not they watch it. Given how important it is, you'll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.

#### 3\. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website

Each time you publish a new video, make sure you embed it on your website or blog. Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.

#### 4\. Add Tags To The Video Description

![youtube seo tips - add tags to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-3.png)

When you upload your video, remember to add tags to the "About" section of the page. You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.

When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.

#### 5\. Edit The Filename

![youtube seo tips - edit the file name](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-4.png)

The filename of your video, or the "video URL," can also affect its rankings. Including keywords in this section will help the crawlers index your video faster, which will increase its chances of ranking higher.

#### 6\. Add Subtitles and Closed Captions

![youtube seo tips - add subtitles and closed captions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-5.png)

Adding subtitles and closed captions to your videos is also a good idea, especially if you want the video's ranking and viewership to improve. Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.

#### 7\. Select Video Category

![youtube seo tips - select video category](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-6.png)

When uploading a video, be sure to select the most appropriate category for it. Essentially, this helps with SEO optimization because choosing the right category means that YouTube's algorithm will place your video in the proper search results. In turn, viewers will easily find your video and watch it.

#### 8\. Use a Compelling Thumbnail

![youtube seo tips - use compelling thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-7.png)

Make sure you use [the right YouTube video thumbnail image](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as this makes a big difference in the click-through rate. You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.

Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.

Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.

#### 9\. Make High-Quality Longer

Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.

When it comes to YouTube SEO, keywords are crucial. YouTube uses these keywords to determine the subject of your video, index the content, and then associate it with what users are searching for. As such, you must add them to certain fields, including description, tags, and title, when you are uploading the video file. YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.

For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.

#### 2\. Use a Good Video Title

The title of your video is the first thing other people see, and it's what decides whether or not they watch it. Given how important it is, you'll want to make sure that your title accurately reflects the content of your video and includes all relevant keywords.

#### 3\. Link Your Videos Directly to Your Website

Each time you publish a new video, make sure you embed it on your website or blog. Not only will this encourage viewers to stay on your website instead of leaving immediately, but it will also make it easier for search engines crawlers to index your website.

#### 4\. Add Tags To The Video Description

![youtube seo tips - add tags to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-3.png)

When you upload your video, remember to add tags to the "About" section of the page. You can do this by adding some relevant keywords with each tag like you would with blog posts.

When planning your strategy for YouTube keywords, you need to find 10-20 single keyword tags you want to rank for; keep in mind that this platform limits the number of tags users can include in a video. So you should first add the most relevant keyword phrases then include specific multi-word tags that will easily rank on top of search results.

#### 5\. Edit The Filename

The filename of your video, or the "video URL," can also affect its rankings. Including keywords in this section will help the crawlers index your video faster, which will increase its chances of ranking higher.

#### 6\. Add Subtitles and Closed Captions

Adding subtitles and closed captions to your videos is also a good idea, especially if you want the video's ranking and viewership to improve. Subtitles make it easier for new viewers to understand your videos, especially if your audience comes from different linguistic backgrounds.

#### 7\. Select Video Category

![youtube seo tips - select video category](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-seo-tips-6.png)

When uploading a video, be sure to select the most appropriate category for it. Essentially, this helps with SEO optimization because choosing the right category means that YouTube's algorithm will place your video in the proper search results. In turn, viewers will easily find your video and watch it.

#### 8\. Use a Compelling Thumbnail

Make sure you use [the right YouTube video thumbnail image](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as this makes a big difference in the click-through rate. You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.

Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.

Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.

#### 9\. Make High-Quality Longer

Videos that are less than 2 minutes long often rank low. The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.
