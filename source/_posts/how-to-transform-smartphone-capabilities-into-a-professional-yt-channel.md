## Part 2: How to Create a Business YouTube on Mobile

![how to create youtube channel for business](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-create-yt-channel-business.jpg)

The clarity on the relevance of YouTube in this dispensation when it comes to branding or business-boosting is immense. Many savvy entrepreneurs and business companies have come to the known for their beautiful advantages. With over 2 billion people trooping into the site monthly, making your brand come to the limelight in this social media implies reaching one-tenth of the users,i.e., if you play by the rules of strategically planning your business growth, the top. However, this article may not reveal the different strategies to adopt so you can become an influencer in your line of business; instead, it will start from scratch on how to get your YouTube business page started. How then can one create his own business YouTube account?

**1\. Signing into a Google account**

To successfully start using the YouTube app, there is a need to sign officially into Google. If you've it in mind to have a separate Google account for your business account, you kick-start it at this stage.

However, you can still use your name to open a Google account and create a business YouTube account for subsequent use. The truth is that YouTube gives room for you still to make a **business account** with a business name thus, eliminating the need to use a business name in creating your Google account.

**2\. Creating a business name**

Once you create a Google account, the next step is to make your business a YouTube account. This you do by either signing into your YouTube app or via the YouTube website in your mobile browser. Once logged in to the app interface, you will see the profile photo you used in creating your Google account or the initial letter of the first name you used on the top right-hand side of your mobile. Tap on it, and a drop-down menu will come up, tap on the 'create a channel' icon, which will lead you to another interface where you have the option to select 'Get started' or 'No thanks.' A tap on the get started will reveal an option to either create your channel using the name and image of your Google account or use a customized name.

Tap on it, and a drop-down menu will come up, tap on the 'create a channel' icon, which will lead you to another interface where you have the option to select 'Get started' or 'No thanks.' A tap on the get started will reveal an option to either create your channel using the name and image of your Google account or use a customized name.
