## 3\. Jump Cut: [YouTube Influencer 101 Crash Course](https://jumpcut.com/)

Moz, a search engine optimization (SEO) tool, compiled all their instructional videos together for this course, in order to teach you all the basics of how Google determines whether to show your content as number one in the search result page or bury it deep in the basement where it will never see the light of day.
