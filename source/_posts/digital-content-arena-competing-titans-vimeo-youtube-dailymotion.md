## Compare Vimeo, YouTube, and DailyMotion in 4 Aspects

#### 1\.  Content

![video content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-content.jpg)

Before deciding which video platform to choose, you need to find out about the content in which each of them specializes.

**Youtube:** If your content is more related to entertainment then YouTube is the platform to go for.

 **Vimeo:** Vimeo is a closed community specializing in videos by artists from various genres and is considered to be a more creative platform than YouTube.

**Dailymotion:** Dailymotion has a fair share of both but it resembles the YouTube trend.

#### 2\.  Audience Size and Membership

![audience youtube vimeo dailymotion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audience-youtube-vimeo-dailymotion.jpg)

**Youtube:** YouTube’s audience is large, with over 1 billion users that watch hundreds of millions of hours of content – each day! Vimeo has a much smaller for their audience, its 170 million viewers, about 42 million are in the United States.

**Vimeo:** Vimeo comes with 4 membership options – the Basic which is available for free and the paid Plus, ($59.95/ year) Pro ($199.00 a year), and Business membership ($599.00 a year). The storage level and support for each membership option vary. The free membership is limited to just 500 MB/week. YouTube and Dailymotion on the other hand are totally free, and Youtube gives unlimited hosting. However YouTube Red is a $9.99 subscription service that will allow you to watch ad-free videos and download them for watching offline.

**Dailymotion:** DailyMotion is the world's second-largest video-sharing website behind YouTube, statistics claimed by both companies show that YouTube has a significant advantage over DailyMotion in terms of unique site visits, totaling one billion visits per month compared with DailyMotion's 112 million visits per month.

#### 3\.  Limitation of Videos

![video limit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videolimit-youtube-vimeo-dailymotion.jpg)

**Youtube:** One of the best parts about this platform is that it doesn’t come with any upload limit.

**Dailymotion:** Regular users can upload 60 minutes videos of 2 GB limit and the quality of upload is limited to 1280 720p.

**Vimeo:** With a Basic plan, you can upload 500MB/week, with a Plus plan you can upload 5GB/week and with Pro plan you will be able to upload unlimited videos with a per-file limit of 25 GB.

#### 4\.  User Experience

To begin with, both Vimeo and YouTube had a very similar kind of user interface. This has gradually evolved over the years and these days the user interface of Vimeo is more attractive than YouTube. Vimeo would give the user fewer adverts, offer easy navigation and of course, allow them to watch the videos on a large video player. Though these days YouTube is also offering a ‘theatre mode’ for the full-screen view along with a skip adoption, yet the quality of its user experience is still isn’t at par with Vimeo. YouTube is still trying its best to satisfy its one billion/month users but still, Vimeo is the winner when it comes to unparalleled user experience.

# Easy Ways to Make a Great Educational Video for YouTube

YouTube is an app that makes it easy for teachers to carry out their work efficiently and conveniently. A teacher should start a YouTube channel because it is beneficial to their students and themselves. The materials or content dished on these channels helps give lessons and instructions in the absence of the teacher, give a detailed explanation and trigger the students' interest.

Also, it archives all the lessons for a long time and makes them easily accessible by both the present, past, and future students. Students can quickly go back for a review for upcoming exams. Through feedbacks or comments, teachers can provide answers to students with the problem of clarity.

A teacher needs to know what an educational video is, what makes an excellent educational video, and **how to make an educational video for YouTube** before opening a YouTube channel. Now, let's delve into it!

## Part 1\. What's an Educational Video?

From the name "educational video," you can coin out that it is a video made for the sole purpose of educating or passing out knowledge for the sake of learning. The primary purpose of these videos is to teach an audience about a particular problem or important topics they want to learn about.

Sometimes brands use this method to advertise their brand while being a source of information.

## Part 2\. What Makes a Good Educational Video?

An excellent educational video aids the learning process. It triggers learners in analyzing and evaluating concepts provided by the video. Videos are great educational tools that most teachers must adopt due to their role in facilitating the learning process.

To make a good educational video, you should keep the following points in mind:

* **Keep your students engaged**

An excellent educational video should be eye catchy and exciting to get your student's undivided attention. You can achieve it in any way, one of which is that you need to put yourself into the teaching mode, which means that you should give out the impression of your excitement for the course content you are talking about. Ask them questions, let them feel involved in the process. Please don't go ahead talking with a cold tune. It makes them tired of listening or seeing the video.

* **Be sure to maintain a right-size of video length**

It's better shorter than longer. Have you ever seen a boring, long movie? It's almost the same feeling you get seeing a long educational video.

The video should be straightforward to leverage the advantage of this form of learning. One needs to make this video of the right size for easy assimilation by the learner. Depending on the course topic, your video can be between **2 - 20 minutes** long.

Most importantly, don't try to do much and use more straightforward, understandable concepts.

* **Stay focused**

Making your videos focused and not running around many things helps it pass the information that plays a good role in video length management and engagement. Videos that try to divert from the topic may end up not hitting the nail on the head and not accomplishing their purpose.

* **Center your interest on the student’s needs**

Any educational content should be centered to meet the needs of the students. That goes beyond creating content, but covers the entirety of satisfying the needs of your learners.

## Part 3\. How to Make a Great Educational Video for YouTube?

The best and most recommendable video maker for making a great educational video is [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).It is a video maker that enables you to create videos with effects like transition, filters, motion elements, and titles on your video.

You can achieve it in any way, one of which is that you need to put yourself into the teaching mode, which means that you should give out the impression of your excitement for the course content you are talking about.

* **Be sure to maintain a right-size of video length**

It's better shorter than longer. Have you ever seen a boring, long movie? It's almost the same feeling you get seeing a long educational video.

The video should be straightforward to leverage the advantage of this form of learning. One needs to make this video of the right size for easy assimilation by the learner. Depending on the course topic, your video can be between **2 - 20 minutes** long.

Most importantly, don't try to do much and use more straightforward, understandable concepts.

* **Stay focused**

Making your videos focused and not running around many things helps it pass the information that plays a good role in video length management and engagement. Videos that try to divert from the topic may end up not hitting the nail on the head and not accomplishing their purpose.

* **Center your interest on the student’s needs**

Any educational content should be centered to meet the needs of the students. That goes beyond creating content, but covers the entirety of satisfying the needs of your learners.
