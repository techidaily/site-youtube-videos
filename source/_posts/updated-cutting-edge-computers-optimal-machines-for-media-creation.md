This article lists the 3 [best laptops for video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in 2018.

Whether you’re an industry professional or an avid YouTuber, you know how important it is to produce quality videos consistently.

The quality of the videos you create will depend on your creativity, the editing software you use, and the hardware that software is installed on. And as you probably know, it can be tough to work fast and get good results when your hardware or laptop isn’t strong enough to power your software properly and allow you to work at the pace you want.

The best laptops for video editing in 2018 have three things in common. First, they have top-of-the-line display technology for color accuracy, color depth, and clarity. Next, they have discrete (dedicated) Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) with accompanying RAM to enable them to handle video processing fast without compromising other system functions. And finally, they have Intel core i7 CPU processors and Solid-State Drives (SSD) for faster overall performance.

## THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018

The top 3 laptops below are quite impressive. They have the right mix of power and function that video editing requires.

1. [MacBook Pro With Touch Bar](#macbook)
2. [Dell XPS 15](#dell)
3. [Microsoft Surface Book 2](#microsoft)

### 1.MACBOOK PRO WITH TOUCH BAR

![Macbook pro touch bar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-pro-touch-bar.jpg)

**PRICE:** $1500 - $1800

**SYSTEM SPECS:**

CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor

GRAPHICS: Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB memory – 560 with 4GB memory

RAM: 16GB

SCREEN: 15.4” Retina Display

RES: 2880 x 1800px

STORAGE: 128 – 256GB SSD

**PROS**

1. OLED Touch Bar
2. Thunderbolt 3 ports
3. Large Trackpad

 **CONS:**

1. No other input ports available besides Thunderbolt 3
2. Expensive

 The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the best video editing laptop produced by Apple. It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably. The Touch Bar is set-up to show different shortcuts for different apps. It works quite well with Photoshop and will show thumbnails, filter options, a color picker, and more while you’re editing videos or stills.

Working with large 4K video files is much easier with the MacBook Pro. It’s fitted with Thunderbolt 3 Ports which have the highest data and video bandwidth available for USB-C connections. With these Thunderbolt ports, you can also use high-speed and high-power peripherals without a hitch. This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.

Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.

### 2\. DELL XPS 15

![Dell XPS 15](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dell-xps-15.jpg)

**PRICE:** $999 - $1300

**SYSTEM SPECS:**

CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor

GRAPHICS: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050

RAM: 8 - 16GB

SCREEN: 15.6”

RES: FHD - 4k UHD 3840 x 2160px

STORAGE: 256GB – 1TB SSD

**PROS**

1. 4k InfinityEdge display
2. Good battery life
3. Has multiple input ports

 **CONS:**

1. Webcam is oddly positioned

The Dell XPS 15 is one laptop that hits the sweet spot for many videographers. It’s considered the closest competitor to the MacBook Pro reviewed above. In fact, many would argue that it tops the MacBook Pro when it comes to speed, color accuracy, and color depth. Its 15.6” screen has very thin bezels for minimal distraction and immersive work experience. At 4K resolution and displaying a wide range of the sRGB gamut, video editing with the Dell XPS 15 promises to be both smooth and enjoyable.

The Dell XPS 15 is certainly more affordable, while still delivering excellent graphics performance. It features an Intel i7 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics processor. This makes it remarkably fast for video editing, as well as energy-efficient. People who work with different input devices will also like that this laptop has legacy adapters (USB, HDMI, ethernet) alongside a USB type C port.

The biggest downside to the Dell XPS 15 laptop is its oddly positioned webcam. It feels awkward and can be an inconvenience to use since you’ll have to adjust your position significantly while making video calls or recording for your YouTube channel.

### 3\. MICROSOFT SURFACE BOOK 2

![Microsoft Surface Book](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-surface-book.jpg)

**PRICE:** $1499 - $2499

**SYSTEM SPECS:**

CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor

GRAPHICS: Intel HD 620 or Nvidia GTX 1050 / GTX 1060

RAM: 16GB

SCREEN: 15.0”

RES: 3240 x 2160px

STORAGE: 256GB, 512GB – 1TB SSD

**PROS**

1. Detachable screen
2. Has multiple input ports (USB Type-A, USB Type-C, SD card reader)
3. Works with a Stylus

 **CONS:**

1. Expensive
2. Fulcrum hinge

The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is a laptop and a tablet thanks to its detachable screen. At a resolution of 3240 x 2160px, its screen is nearly 4k and can handle Full HD and HD footage with ease. Add to this its capacity to show a considerable portion of the sRGB gamut and its easy-to-use stylus and you can see why this 2-in-1 combo from Microsoft is one of the top 3 laptops for video editing in 2018.

Surface Book 2 also has the right combination of power and storage capacity that video editing requires. It boasts a state-of-the-art NVIDIA graphics processor and an Intel i7 processor for a smooth workflow no matter the size or level of detail involved in your video editing project.

On the downside, this laptop is undoubtedly very expensive. Compared to the function and power you can get from the DELL XPS 15, it’s hard to justify paying nearly $2500 for the Surface Book 2\. Its detachable screen, supported by a fulcrum hinge, also comes at a price. It makes the laptop a bit bulky at one end when it’s folded. This in turn can make day-to-day handling a bit more tricky than it has to be.

## CONCLUSION

If you’re searching for a good laptop to help you improve the quality of your videos in 2018, look no further than these 3\. They have all the power, function, and storage capacity you need to handle any project with ease. Just be mindful of your budget and consider which extras are worth the expense. Go for the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar if customizing your workflow is a priority. Opt for the Dell XPS 15 if you want the best combination of display quality and graphics processing. Finally, consider the Surface Book 2 if you need the flexibility of a 2-in-1 device.

**PROS**

1. Detachable screen
2. Has multiple input ports (USB Type-A, USB Type-C, SD card reader)
3. Works with a Stylus

 **CONS:**

1. Expensive
2. Fulcrum hinge

The Microsoft Surface Book 2 is a laptop and a tablet thanks to its detachable screen. At a resolution of 3240 x 2160px, its screen is nearly 4k and can handle Full HD and HD footage with ease. Add to this its capacity to show a considerable portion of the sRGB gamut and its easy-to-use stylus and you can see why this 2-in-1 combo from Microsoft is one of the top 3 laptops for video editing in 2018.

Surface Book 2 also has the right combination of power and storage capacity that video editing requires. It boasts a state-of-the-art NVIDIA graphics processor and an Intel i7 processor for a smooth workflow no matter the size or level of detail involved in your video editing project.

On the downside, this laptop is undoubtedly very expensive. Compared to the function and power you can get from the DELL XPS 15, it’s hard to justify paying nearly $2500 for the Surface Book 2\. Its detachable screen, supported by a fulcrum hinge, also comes at a price. It makes the laptop a bit bulky at one end when it’s folded. This in turn can make day-to-day handling a bit more tricky than it has to be.

## CONCLUSION

If you’re searching for a good laptop to help you improve the quality of your videos in 2018, look no further than these 3\. They have all the power, function, and storage capacity you need to handle any project with ease. Just be mindful of your budget and consider which extras are worth the expense. Go for the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar if customizing your workflow is a priority. Opt for the Dell XPS 15 if you want the best combination of display quality and graphics processing. Finally, consider the Surface Book 2 if you need the flexibility of a 2-in-1 device.

 What do you think is the best laptop for video editing?

This article lists the 3 [best laptops for video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in 2018.

Whether you’re an industry professional or an avid YouTuber, you know how important it is to produce quality videos consistently.

The quality of the videos you create will depend on your creativity, the editing software you use, and the hardware that software is installed on. And as you probably know, it can be tough to work fast and get good results when your hardware or laptop isn’t strong enough to power your software properly and allow you to work at the pace you want.

The best laptops for video editing in 2018 have three things in common. First, they have top-of-the-line display technology for color accuracy, color depth, and clarity. Next, they have discrete (dedicated) Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) with accompanying RAM to enable them to handle video processing fast without compromising other system functions. And finally, they have Intel core i7 CPU processors and Solid-State Drives (SSD) for faster overall performance.

## THE TOP 3 LAPTOPS FOR EDITING VIDEO IN 2018

The top 3 laptops below are quite impressive. They have the right mix of power and function that video editing requires.

1. [MacBook Pro With Touch Bar](#macbook)
2. [Dell XPS 15](#dell)
3. [Microsoft Surface Book 2](#microsoft)

### 1.MACBOOK PRO WITH TOUCH BAR

![Macbook pro touch bar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-pro-touch-bar.jpg)

**PRICE:** $1500 - $1800

**SYSTEM SPECS:**

CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor

GRAPHICS: Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB memory – 560 with 4GB memory

RAM: 16GB

SCREEN: 15.4” Retina Display

RES: 2880 x 1800px

STORAGE: 128 – 256GB SSD

**PROS**

1. OLED Touch Bar
2. Thunderbolt 3 ports
3. Large Trackpad

 **CONS:**

1. No other input ports available besides Thunderbolt 3
2. Expensive

 The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is the best video editing laptop produced by Apple. It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably. The Touch Bar is set-up to show different shortcuts for different apps. It works quite well with Photoshop and will show thumbnails, filter options, a color picker, and more while you’re editing videos or stills.

Working with large 4K video files is much easier with the MacBook Pro. It’s fitted with Thunderbolt 3 Ports which have the highest data and video bandwidth available for USB-C connections. With these Thunderbolt ports, you can also use high-speed and high-power peripherals without a hitch. This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.

Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.

### 2\. DELL XPS 15

![Dell XPS 15](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dell-xps-15.jpg)

**PRICE:** $999 - $1300

**SYSTEM SPECS:**

CPU: Intel Core i7 Processor

GRAPHICS: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050

RAM: 8 - 16GB

SCREEN: 15.6”

RES: FHD - 4k UHD 3840 x 2160px

STORAGE: 256GB – 1TB SSD

**PROS**

1. 4k InfinityEdge display
2. Good battery life
3. Has multiple input ports

 **CONS:**

1. Webcam is oddly positioned

The Dell XPS 15 is one laptop that hits the sweet spot for many videographers. It’s considered the closest competitor to the MacBook Pro reviewed above. In fact, many would argue that it tops the MacBook Pro when it comes to speed, color accuracy, and color depth. Its 15.6” screen has very thin bezels for minimal distraction and immersive work experience. At 4K resolution and displaying a wide range of the sRGB gamut, video editing with the Dell XPS 15 promises to be both smooth and enjoyable.

The Dell XPS 15 is certainly more affordable, while still delivering excellent graphics performance. It features an Intel i7 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics processor. This makes it remarkably fast for video editing, as well as energy-efficient. People who work with different input devices will also like that this laptop has legacy adapters (USB, HDMI, ethernet) alongside a USB type C port.

The biggest downside to the Dell XPS 15 laptop is its oddly positioned webcam. It feels awkward and can be an inconvenience to use since you’ll have to adjust your position significantly while making video calls or recording for your YouTube channel.

### 3\. MICROSOFT SURFACE BOOK 2

## Part 1\. How to Get Monetized on YouTube: Rules and Requirements

### How to Monetize YouTube Channel

Begin making money from your YouTube videos through the YouTube Partner Program. You can create earnings from your YouTube channel by connecting it to your Google account. Monetize your website using Google AdSense.

Google AdSense generates substantial website revenue. If viewers interact with the ads in your videos, you earn money. Adding AdSense to your YouTube channel makes your videos monetizable.

Some videos cannot be monetized, however. Content must meet specific requirements to qualify for YouTube's program. Criteria include content quality, community guidelines, and copyright compliance. Your YouTube channel can generate income once your videos meet these standards.

### Monetizing YouTube Videos: What Are The Requirements?

You can monetize your YouTube videos by joining the YouTube Partner Program. Everyone can create a YouTube account, but YPP requires certain requirements. Every time you create content, you must consider these requirements.

Prior to applying for the program, your channel must first accomplish the following:

* One thousand subscribers
* A total of 4,000 watch hours in the past year

Building your audience and creating great content will help you meet these requirements. Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube's rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.

Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.

When you upload content to YouTube, you'll need to keep these things in mind. Those who plan on monetizing their videos should thoroughly read these documents. You also need to set up a Google AdSense account, which tracks and pays for your YouTube ads.

### 1\. Google AdSense

YouTube channel monetization is the most popular method. By adding AdSense to your videos, you can generate revenue from the ads displayed. You must adhere to our advertiser-friendly guidelines when creating your videos. The monetization of all videos may not be possible, therefore. YouTube and AdSense work seamlessly together.

### 2\. Paid Sponsorships

Sponsorship involves paying a content creator to use, demonstrate, or test a brand's product in a video. Both the creator and the brand benefit from sponsorships provided by brands.

The rewards of sponsorship can be immense, but sponsorships are hard to come by. You can pitch relevant brands to partner with your influential channel if your channel has a large following.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. YouTube Premium

Joining the YouTube Partner Program qualifies you for YouTube Premium. In addition, it can increase your earnings. YouTube Premium members get paid when they watch your content as a creator. The number of Premium members has now surpassed 20 million. It is possible that this may occur quite frequently. YouTube Premium will automatically pay you if someone watches your content.

### 4\. Memberships

Creating membership tiers on your channel allows you to offer different perks to different levels of subscription. Using memberships has the main benefit of providing a more steady income stream. Ad revenue is a more traditional method of monetization. This feature is enabled by channels with at least 1,000 subscribers, and the creator sets fees.

### 5\. Merchandise

You can sell merchandise on YouTube videos with over 10,000 subscribers using a merch shelf. By selling branded merchandise to your YouTube fans, you can generate additional revenue.

It's especially useful for YouTube creators without their own website who want to sell merchandise. Currently, there are over 45 platforms or retailers worldwide that support merch, so growing your brand is easy.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 6\. Invest in crowd-funding

It's not just for startups anymore; you can use crowdfunding to fund content creation on YouTube as well. You can find people to support your work through third-party applications like Patreon in exchange for perks. You can now place sponsor buttons on your YouTube videos, which allows you to crowdfund. With this, you can offer rewards in exchange for monthly funding like with Patreon.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 7\. Stickers, chats, and thanks

During live streams and premieres, creators can engage their fans with Super Chat and Super Stickers. In the live chat, fans can purchase Super Chats to display their message prominently. A Super Sticker is an animated image displayed during a live chat session. The Super Thanks feature enables creators to earn income from their videos. Additional appreciation may be expressed by those who wish to do so

### 8\. YouTube Shorts

Using the YouTube app, short, vertical videos can be uploaded straight to YouTube using a smartphone. In the same way as Instagram Stories are uploaded to the social media site. The length of YouTube shorts is limited to 60 seconds. In 2021 and 2022, a $100 million fund will be distributed for YouTube Shorts. With this initial stage, YouTube Shorts began to monetize in May 2021\. A YouTube Short will only be compensated if it meets the fund's criteria.

## Part 1\. How to Get Monetized on YouTube: Rules and Requirements

### How to Monetize YouTube Channel

Begin making money from your YouTube videos through the YouTube Partner Program. You can create earnings from your YouTube channel by connecting it to your Google account. Monetize your website using Google AdSense.

Google AdSense generates substantial website revenue. If viewers interact with the ads in your videos, you earn money. Adding AdSense to your YouTube channel makes your videos monetizable.

Some videos cannot be monetized, however. Content must meet specific requirements to qualify for YouTube's program. Criteria include content quality, community guidelines, and copyright compliance. Your YouTube channel can generate income once your videos meet these standards.

### Monetizing YouTube Videos: What Are The Requirements?

You can monetize your YouTube videos by joining the YouTube Partner Program. Everyone can create a YouTube account, but YPP requires certain requirements. Every time you create content, you must consider these requirements.

Prior to applying for the program, your channel must first accomplish the following:

* One thousand subscribers
* A total of 4,000 watch hours in the past year

Building your audience and creating great content will help you meet these requirements. Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube's rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.

Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.

When you upload content to YouTube, you'll need to keep these things in mind. Those who plan on monetizing their videos should thoroughly read these documents. You also need to set up a Google AdSense account, which tracks and pays for your YouTube ads.
