Most users watch videos on the top of search results. For this reason, if you are not ranking at the top of search results, you will miss out on traffic.

Knowing where you rank on search results will allow you to develop an effective strategy that will help you increase your views and grow your following.

## Netix on YouTube

[Netix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLW2fOeUEhu7kBvZwlOTZ4A/featured) posts Minecraft-themed graphics, and only Minecraft-themed graphics. You'll find a lot of high quality banners on this channel, and they're all free to download. Unlike a lot of creators who post one or two free banners, but mostly focus on other gaming content, Netix was at one point consistently posting new channel art (about once a month) for over a year.

Besides Netix, there are a lot of other artists posting gaming or Minecraft-themed banners on YouTube with download links. Just type 'minecraft youtube banner' into the search bar.

## Best Business Template

[Best Business Template](https://www.soccerbbc.com/11525/minecraft-youtube-banner.html) has all kinds of graphics and images, including YouTube channel art. If you scroll through this page you’ll see a ton of Minecraft YouTube banners which you can download for free.

Think of a lot of the banners you find on these sites as templates. After downloading the image you’ll use as your background you can still personalize it by adding your channel’s name or logo, and even your posting schedule if you have one (keep [these dimensions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in mind so nothing gets cut off). This can be done easily, for free, in an online image editor like Canva.com or [some other sites](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).

Do you know anywhere else creators can get Minecraft YouTube banners?
