## Part 1: YouTube Trends for 2022

Let us begin our discussion with the different YouTube trends for 2022.

### 1\. The Worst Youtube Trends That Plague the Platform

YouTube is filled with the so-called “trendy” videos, where every other creator is copying the same content for the videos so that they can get included in the trend. It is causing a lack of uniqueness in scope and more plague in the platform.

### 3\. YouTube Viral Challenges with Pointless Videos

Nowadays, one can find similar types of challenge videos, where the video has no clear or noble purpose. Instead, the content is identical to again fall in the trend. And thus, it leads to more plague content on the platform.

YouTube is also under the large-scale crisis of wrongfully flagging video creators and their videos for copyright or DMCA abuse.

### 5\. Over-The-Top Self-Promotion

The creators of this platform have been stressing excessively over self-promotion. Therefore, it causes the videos and, thus, the platform to lose their value and purpose.
