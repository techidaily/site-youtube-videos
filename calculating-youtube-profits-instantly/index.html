<p>Let’s take a look at the YouTube Money Calculator now and explore your potential for generating income from your passion for YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-a-CPM-and-How-Do-YouTube-Money-Calculators-Average-It-Out"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-a-CPM-and-How-Do-YouTube-Money-Calculators-Average-It-Out" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s a CPM and How Do YouTube Money Calculators Average It Out?"></a>Part 1: What’s a CPM and How Do YouTube Money Calculators Average It Out?</h2><p>CPM stands for ‘cost per mille&#x2F;thousand’ and is the price of a thousand ad impressions (to the advertiser. For the creator, this is the amount of money they make per thousand ad impressions).</p>
<p>YouTube calculators will never be able to know the CPM for a YouTube channel as the rates vary for different channels and different ads. Disclosing your CPM is against the rules, so there’s not a lot of information out there to go on.</p>
<p>However, by taking an average of some of the current CPM rates from advertisers on YouTube, calculators are able to average out what a YouTube channel could be making. Keep in mind that, usually, the numbers that they use can be a bit on the high side compared to actual earnings. At times, though, these calculators can be very close.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator"></a>Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator</h2><p>The YouTube Money Calculator is a free calculator tool that allows you to estimate the money obtained from any YouTube video. Calculations are entirely based on the number of views and an average CPM of $2 - $5. A user just needs to insert the total number of video views that they think they can get or that another channel has to discover how much a person could earn or be earning.</p>
<p>If you don’t know your CPM yet, don’t worry because our tool can give you an estimated revenue calculation based on a commonly accepted range of CPM figures for your views. Using this number, the YouTube Money Calculator can give you potential revenue by video as well as by channel on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. Let’s take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#videos">1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos</a></li>
<li><a href="#channel">2. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Videos"><a href="#1-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos"></a>1. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Videos</h3><p>To use YouTube Money Calculator to get an estimated calculation of your revenue for a single video, simply set the number of views you get per day (or hope to get) and the CPM rates. If you don’t know your CPM, the tool will automatically select a typical range based on the number of views.</p>
<p>From here you can start to play around and see what the impact could be of a different number of views and different CPM range. Do keep in mind that these figures are estimated, and there are many factors that come into play to determine your final CPM rate.</p>
<p>If you want to go deeper into your research and discover how much revenue a specific video could make, you can simply paste in the URL of the video you want to investigate, and the YouTube Money Calculator will show you the results. These will be presented as the number of total video views as well as the estimated earnings for that video based on typical CPM rates, making it a great resource to establish whether to monetize a video or not.</p>
<h3 id="2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel"><a href="#2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel"></a>2. Estimated YouTube Revenue by Channel</h3><p>If you’d like a more complete view of your YouTube earnings potential, why not investigate the revenue possibilities for the whole channel? Simply paste your channel link into the box and our tool will estimate how much you could be earning if you monetize that channel.</p>
<p>As well as showing this, the tool will show all sorts of other useful information such as number of total views, number of subscribers, number of uploaded videos and even your country and category. It’s a great place to start to evaluate your efforts and to get a realistic idea of what your earnings could be.</p>

<h3 id="1-How-Social-Blade-Calculates-YouTube-Money"><a href="#1-How-Social-Blade-Calculates-YouTube-Money" class="headerlink" title="1. How Social Blade Calculates YouTube Money"></a>1. How Social Blade Calculates YouTube Money</h3><p>Social Blade delivers a calculation based on a CPM rate between .25 cents and $4 USD. Users need only type in the name of the channel they are interested in and Social Blade will deliver all kinds of information about that channel, like how many subscribers and views it received in the last 30 days. It will also include estimates of monthly and yearly earnings. The revenue results are adjusted based off of the overall size of the channel and the total number of views that they receive each day. You can even scroll down for estimates of daily earnings listed by date.</p>
<h3 id="2-How-Influencer-Marketing-Hub-Calculates-YouTube-Money"><a href="#2-How-Influencer-Marketing-Hub-Calculates-YouTube-Money" class="headerlink" title="2. How Influencer Marketing Hub Calculates YouTube Money"></a>2. How Influencer Marketing Hub Calculates YouTube Money</h3><p>Influencer Marketing Hub is almost like an active infographic that allows a user to very quickly adjust sliders based on the daily video views, active engagement, views per month, and views per year.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated"><a href="#Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?"></a>Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?</h2><p>YouTube partner money is calculated using something called the CPM. Your CPM, if you’re new to YouTube and partner advertising, is likely to be quite low, but can be built up over time.</p>
<p>CPM is actually a term for advertisers rather than content creators, as it denotes the amount an advertiser pays to serve its ad to 1,000 views of a video. What you really want to know is your RPM, or revenue per thousand, which is about how much you’ll get paid for 1,000 views of that ad. In the YouTube world, they call this number eCPM which stands for effective CPM, and if you have access to YouTube analytics, you’ll be able to find it under the estimated monetized playbacks metric.</p>
<p>If you don’t have YouTube Analytics, you can estimate your eCPM by dividing your most recent earnings by the number of monetized views and then multiplying by 1,000. For example, if you got 10,000 views of a video and earned $30, then your CPM would be $3.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that affect what your CPM is, including what category it’s in, what the season is (e.g. Christmas, Halloween), what language you speak, which country you’re from, how much competition there is and much more. As an average, most advertisers are paying in the region of $7.60 per 1,000 impressions, although this can be as high as $15 or as low as $0.10.</p>
<p>But that’s not the whole story.</p>
<p>Of course, YouTube needs to make money too, so don’t expect to see all of that $7.60 popped into your AdSense account. Google keeps 45 percent of all YouTube advertising revenue, so you’ll get the other 55 per cent. If you were earning that average $7.60, your actual earnings would be $4.18 per 1,000 views.</p>
<p>As your subscriber numbers rise and your daily views rise, so will your CPM, so don’t get disheartened if you’ve discovered you’re on $2 or worse. Keep plugging away and building your fan base, and you’ll get there in the end.</p>
<p>It’s important to realize that, for most new channels, they’ll need to post videos for around two years before they start earning anything significant. If you’re just getting started on YouTube, find your niche and make sure it’s one that advertisers care about. Get it right, and you’ll have a highly targeted audience base which advertisers are willing to pay good money to use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform"></a>Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform</h2><p>If you’ve had a go with the YouTube money calculator and are excited about the potential to make money from YouTube, the next thing you’ll need to do is to sign up for the partner program. Here’s how:</p>
<pre><code>     * **Find out if you qualify**: You&#39;ll need to be 18 or over and to have had at least 4,000 views on your channel and 1,000 subscribers in the past 12 months
     * **Enable monetization on your account**: Sign in, select &#39;creator studio&#39;, then go to Channel &gt; Status features. Look for the tab for Monetization and click to enable.
     * **Agree to the terms**: Once you&#39;ve read and agreed to them, click accept
     * **Choose monetizing options**: Pick from overlay in the video, TrueView in-stream ads or video contains product placement. You can always change this later.
     * **Confirm enrolment**: Click &#39;monetize my videos&#39; to confirm enrolment
</code></pre>
<p>Once you’ve done all that, YouTube will review your application and decide if you can join the program. Usually, this happens within a matter of seconds, generating confirmation via email. Your account will now have ‘Partner Verified’ on it, and your chosen ads will start being displayed immediately.</p>

However, the reality is that 99 per cent of those on YouTube are earning peanuts for the effort they put into their channels from these advertising streams.</p>
<p>However, there are other ways to make money on YouTube.

<h2 id="Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?"></a>Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?</h2><p>YouTube partner money is calculated using something called the CPM. Your CPM, if you’re new to YouTube and partner advertising, is likely to be quite low, but can be built up over time.</p>
<p>CPM is actually a term for advertisers rather than content creators, as it denotes the amount an advertiser pays to serve its ad to 1,000 views of a video. What you really want to know is your RPM, or revenue per thousand, which is about how much you’ll get paid for 1,000 views of that ad. In the YouTube world, they call this number eCPM which stands for effective CPM, and if you have access to YouTube analytics, you’ll be able to find it under the estimated monetized playbacks metric.</p>
<p>If you don’t have YouTube Analytics, you can estimate your eCPM by dividing your most recent earnings by the number of monetized views and then multiplying by 1,000. For example, if you got 10,000 views of a video and earned $30, then your CPM would be $3.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that affect what your CPM is, including what category it’s in, what the season is (e.g. Christmas, Halloween), what language you speak, which country you’re from, how much competition there is and much more. As an average, most advertisers are paying in the region of $7.60 per 1,000 impressions, although this can be as high as $15 or as low as $0.10.</p>
<p>But that’s not the whole story.</p>
<p>Of course, YouTube needs to make money too, so don’t expect to see all of that $7.60 popped into your AdSense account. Google keeps 45 percent of all YouTube advertising revenue, so you’ll get the other 55 per cent. If you were earning that average $7.60, your actual earnings would be $4.18 per 1,000 views.</p>
<p>As your subscriber numbers rise and your daily views rise, so will your CPM, so don’t get disheartened if you’ve discovered you’re on $2 or worse. Keep plugging away and building your fan base, and you’ll get there in the end.</p>
<p>It’s important to realize that, for most new channels, they’ll need to post videos for around two years before they start earning anything significant. If you’re just getting started on YouTube, find your niche and make sure it’s one that advertisers care about. Get it right, and you’ll have a highly targeted audience base which advertisers are willing to pay good money to use.</p>

<pre><code>     * **Find out if you qualify**: You&#39;ll need to be 18 or over and to have had at least 4,000 views on your channel and 1,000 subscribers in the past 12 months
     * **Enable monetization on your account**: Sign in, select &#39;creator studio&#39;, then go to Channel &gt; Status features. Look for the tab for Monetization and click to enable.
     * **Agree to the terms**: Once you&#39;ve read and agreed to them, click accept
     * **Choose monetizing options**: Pick from overlay in the video, TrueView in-stream ads or video contains product placement. You can always change this later.
     * **Confirm enrolment**: Click &#39;monetize my videos&#39; to confirm enrolment
</code></pre>
<p>Once you’ve done all that, YouTube will review your application and decide if you can join the program. Usually, this happens within a matter of seconds, generating confirmation via email. Your account will now have ‘Partner Verified’ on it, and your chosen ads will start being displayed immediately.</p>

<p>YouTube calculators will never be able to know the CPM for a YouTube channel as the rates vary for different channels and different ads. Disclosing your CPM is against the rules, so there’s not a lot of information out there to go on.</p>
<p>However, by taking an average of some of the current CPM rates from advertisers on YouTube, calculators are able to average out what a YouTube channel could be making. Keep in mind that, usually, the numbers that they use can be a bit on the high side compared to actual earnings. At times, though, these calculators can be very close.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-is-YouTube-Partner-Money-Calculated-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?"></a>Part 4: How is YouTube Partner Money Calculated?</h2><p>YouTube partner money is calculated using something called the CPM. Your CPM, if you’re new to YouTube and partner advertising, is likely to be quite low, but can be built up over time.</p>
<p>CPM is actually a term for advertisers rather than content creators, as it denotes the amount an advertiser pays to serve its ad to 1,000 views of a video. What you really want to know is your RPM, or revenue per thousand, which is about how much you’ll get paid for 1,000 views of that ad. In the YouTube world, they call this number eCPM which stands for effective CPM, and if you have access to YouTube analytics, you’ll be able to find it under the estimated monetized playbacks metric.</p>
<p>If you don’t have YouTube Analytics, you can estimate your eCPM by dividing your most recent earnings by the number of monetized views and then multiplying by 1,000. For example, if you got 10,000 views of a video and earned $30, then your CPM would be $3.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that affect what your CPM is, including what category it’s in, what the season is (e.g. Christmas, Halloween), what language you speak, which country you’re from, how much competition there is and much more. As an average, most advertisers are paying in the region of $7.60 per 1,000 impressions, although this can be as high as $15 or as low as $0.10.</p>
<p>But that’s not the whole story.</p>
<p>Of course, YouTube needs to make money too, so don’t expect to see all of that $7.60 popped into your AdSense account. Google keeps 45 percent of all YouTube advertising revenue, so you’ll get the other 55 per cent. If you were earning that average $7.60, your actual earnings would be $4.18 per 1,000 views.</p>
<p>As your subscriber numbers rise and your daily views rise, so will your CPM, so don’t get disheartened if you’ve discovered you’re on $2 or worse. Keep plugging away and building your fan base, and you’ll get there in the end.</p>
<p>It’s important to realize that, for most new channels, they’ll need to post videos for around two years before they start earning anything significant. If you’re just getting started on YouTube, find your niche and make sure it’s one that advertisers care about. Get it right, and you’ll have a highly targeted audience base which advertisers are willing to pay good money to use.</p>

Here’s how:</p>
<pre><code>     * **Find out if you qualify**: You&#39;ll need to be 18 or over and to have had at least 4,000 views on your channel and 1,000 subscribers in the past 12 months
     * **Enable monetization on your account**: Sign in, select &#39;creator studio&#39;, then go to Channel &gt; Status features. Look for the tab for Monetization and click to enable.
     * **Agree to the terms**: Once you&#39;ve read and agreed to them, click accept
     * **Choose monetizing options**: Pick from overlay in the video, TrueView in-stream ads or video contains product placement. You can always change this later.
     * **Confirm enrolment**: Click &#39;monetize my videos&#39; to confirm enrolment
</code></pre>
<p>Once you’ve done all that, YouTube will review your application and decide if you can join the program. Usually, this happens within a matter of seconds, generating confirmation via email. Your account will now have ‘Partner Verified’ on it, and your chosen ads will start being displayed immediately.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal"><a href="#What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal" class="headerlink" title="What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?"></a>What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?</h2><p>YouTube was developed to allow anyone to upload any video content they wanted. On the site, users were anticipated to be allowed to upload, distribute, and watch content without restriction. It has subsequently grown to become one of the world’s most popular video distribution platforms.</p>
<p>YouTube has evolved into a formidable platform for posting high-quality films with a range of settings and aspects over the years. It has also established a set of authoritarian rules and procedures for dealing with copyright issues as well as dangerous, offensive, and deceptive content. Do you make YouTube videos but are frustrated by the fact that you can only upload fifteen-minute recordings? All you need is quick account verification. This post will show you how to go about doing so.</p>
<p>Before you decide to submit a video, double-check that it doesn’t infringe on anyone’s copyright and that it follows YouTube’s community guidelines. Let’s have a look at what you need to do to upload longer videos on YouTube and ensure that it gets a lot of views before getting into the main guidelines and requirements.</p>
<h2 id="Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube"><a href="#Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube" class="headerlink" title="Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?"></a>Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?</h2><p>Yes, there is a restriction to the duration of videos that can be uploaded to YouTube. YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction.</p>
<p>Moreover, the length of a YouTube video is determined by whether or not your account is verified. Your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long or fewer if you aren’t verified. Your YouTube videos can be up to 12 hours long or 128 GB in size if you are verified.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shorter videos were deemed to be superior… You’ll lose viewers if you make a video longer solely for the sake of making it longer. On the other hand, longer videos should be planned into your video material. Videos that are between 7 and 15 minutes long do well in general.</li>
<li>Surprisingly, people prefer lengthier videos, and artists haven’t noticed a drop in views when they develop longer ones. When they focus on longer films, they’ve seen an increase in views and subscribers. Nikki Tutorials’ videos, for example, were roughly eight minutes long in 2015.</li>
<li>It’s time to get serious about making lengthier videos. If you want to appear in YouTube’s search, you’ll need to increase the length of your videos steadily. This includes producing other vlogs, in-depth tutorials, and GRWM videos. All of these video formats tend to be lengthy.</li>
<li>As your videos get longer, you may see that organic views increase as you appear more frequently in organic searches. Because YouTube defines long-video channels as ‘top producers,’ such videos are pushed to the top of search results, you’ll see an increase in subscribers.</li>
<li>Lastly, A YouTube video should be at least ten minutes long. Videos that are seven to fifteen minutes long tend to do well on the site. Keep in mind, though, that your video should only be as long as it needs to be.</li>

<h2 id="What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal-2"><a href="#What-Is-Youtube’s-Primary-Goal-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?"></a>What Is Youtube’s Primary Goal?</h2><p>YouTube was developed to allow anyone to upload any video content they wanted. On the site, users were anticipated to be allowed to upload, distribute, and watch content without restriction. It has subsequently grown to become one of the world’s most popular video distribution platforms.</p>
<p>YouTube has evolved into a formidable platform for posting high-quality films with a range of settings and aspects over the years. It has also established a set of authoritarian rules and procedures for dealing with copyright issues as well as dangerous, offensive, and deceptive content. Do you make YouTube videos but are frustrated by the fact that you can only upload fifteen-minute recordings? All you need is quick account verification. This post will show you how to go about doing so.</p>
<p>Before you decide to submit a video, double-check that it doesn’t infringe on anyone’s copyright and that it follows YouTube’s community guidelines. Let’s have a look at what you need to do to upload longer videos on YouTube and ensure that it gets a lot of views before getting into the main guidelines and requirements.</p>
<h2 id="Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube-2"><a href="#Is-There-A-Limit-On-How-Long-A-Video-Can-Be-On-Youtube-2" class="headerlink" title="Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?"></a>Is There A Limit On How Long A Video Can Be On Youtube?</h2><p>Yes, there is a restriction to the duration of videos that can be uploaded to YouTube. YouTube enables video uploads of up to 15 minutes in length by default. If you try to upload a video that is more than 15 minutes long, it will fail. This is a YouTube restriction, not a Brightcove restriction.</p>
<p>Moreover, the length of a YouTube video is determined by whether or not your account is verified. Your YouTube videos can only be 15 minutes long or fewer if you aren’t verified. Your YouTube videos can be up to 12 hours long or 128 GB in size if you are verified.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shorter videos were deemed to be superior… You’ll lose viewers if you make a video longer solely for the sake of making it longer. On the other hand, longer videos should be planned into your video material. Videos that are between 7 and 15 minutes long do well in general.</li>
<li>Surprisingly, people prefer lengthier videos, and artists haven’t noticed a drop in views when they develop longer ones. When they focus on longer films, they’ve seen an increase in views and subscribers. Nikki Tutorials’ videos, for example, were roughly eight minutes long in 2015.</li>
<li>It’s time to get serious about making lengthier videos. If you want to appear in YouTube’s search, you’ll need to increase the length of your videos steadily. This includes producing other vlogs, in-depth tutorials, and GRWM videos. All of these video formats tend to be lengthy.</li>
<li>As your videos get longer, you may see that organic views increase as you appear more frequently in organic searches. Because YouTube defines long-video channels as ‘top producers,’ such videos are pushed to the top of search results, you’ll see an increase in subscribers.</li>
<li>Lastly, A YouTube video should be at least ten minutes long. Videos that are seven to fifteen minutes long tend to do well on the site. Keep in mind, though, that your video should only be as long as it needs to be.</li>

You’ve shot a great video, but it’s bloated with undesired segments and irrelevant content, making it too huge or unusable to upload to YouTube. You can chop the video into smaller segments and eliminate the unnecessary bits as needed to generate a new film to make things easier.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use yet powerful video editing program that allows you to chop videos into many parts and perform a variety of video editing activities to create a fantastic home movie.</p>
<p>YouTube Video Editor is extremely simple to use. However, it only offers a few basic video editing features and is prone to crashing when dealing with huge files. Try Wondershare Filmora if you want to make your video look more professional. This desktop video editing program can assist you in doing video editing chores quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Filmora online video trimmer is a free online tool that can help you trim video instantly if you prefer an online alternative. You can drag and drop your video from your PC or a video link.

To open the Scene Detection window, choose the video in the media library (not the timeline), right-click it, and select “Scene Detection.” Filmora will automatically split your videos into multiple segments when you click Detect, depending on scene changes.</p>

Keep in mind that your YouTube upload limit is determined by whether or not your channel has been verified. Please continue the steps outlined above if it hasn’t been confirmed yet.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a few things you should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>To upload files larger than 20GB, make sure you have the most recent version of your browser.</li>
<li>If you can’t find the link to increase your limit, it’s possible that your longer videos feature is already turned on. Check your Accounts Feature page to be sure. To be allowed to upload a lengthier video, you must have a good standing on the YouTube Community Guidelines.</li>
<li>Check for copyright claims and strikes if you’re having trouble uploading a video.</li>
<li>If you’re uploading a long video and haven’t verified your account yet, you’ll be prompted to do so after the video has been uploaded.</li>
<li>Simply click the Verify account icon beside the video, then activate this video in your video manager to publish it.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that it will be set to private by default, so make sure to modify the privacy settings if necessary.</li>
