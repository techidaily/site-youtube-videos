So, in this article, we have discussed a step-by-step process for creating **a YouTube music playlist** on a web browser, Android, and iPhone, and hopefully, you can dance to your favorite beats without searching for them first on YouTube.

Step2 When you have signed in, look for your favorite track on the YouTube live feed page or search for it in the search bar at the top of the screen. Once you have found the song, click on it to play it, click the three horizontal dots at the bottom right-hand side of the video, and select the **"Save"** option from the small pop-up.

The differences between the three options are:

* A **Public** playlist is a list of videos that any random person can see, access, or use it.
* An **Unlisted** playlist can be shared with others by using its link to access it.
* A **Private** playlist cannot be seen, accessed or used by anyone except you.

Finally, click the **"Create"** button, and your YouTube music playlist will be saved automatically.

Step4 Repeat the second and third steps to save all the other songs you wish to add to the same playlist. Once done, head back to the main YouTube feed page, click "Library," and scroll to the middle of the page in the right pane to access and play the music playlist at your will.
