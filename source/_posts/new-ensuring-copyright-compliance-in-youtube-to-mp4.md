## Tips To Prevent Unsafe Video File Format Conversion

It is always preferable to be safe and cautious beforehand rather than curing the disease afterward. There are some useful tips and tricks that you can always use while not only using and downloading the video format converters but any software in general.

So here we are to save you from any potential vulnerabilities that might come across with the use of YouTube video format converters:

1. Always download the converter from an authenticated/official website.
2. When coming across Ads or pop-ups, never click on it.
3. Never enter your personal credentials unnecessarily like username, password, credit card number or phone number. That might be a trap to hack and breach your privacy for data theft or any other undesirable purposes.
4. Check for reviews of the website or software before downloading it.
5. Download a good antivirus and scan your downloads for any potential viruses.
6. Prefer to download YouTube videos from YouTube sites only. As others might download a file from an illegal video archive.
7. The tool ought to work as it was promised/advertised to work like, having the same features and gives the promised result without taking extensive time.
8. Monitor the behavior of your PC.
