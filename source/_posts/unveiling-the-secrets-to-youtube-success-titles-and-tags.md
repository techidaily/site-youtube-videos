## Find the Best Keywords

One of the most important steps to ensuring SEO success is to identify the keywords that you should be using.

The keyword planner will scan through the top searches for that video link and determine the keywords that are used most often.

The keyword list can be a bit overwhelming the first time. Remember to use keywords that get at least 300 searches per month on Google. Using popular keywords will help you match up against competitors in your niche.
