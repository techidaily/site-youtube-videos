Remember that “Shorts” isn’t available in all the countries yet. So, you can confirm whether it is already in your country. If not, you can bypass GEO restrictions by using free VPNs.

1. First, download and install a VPN app.
2. Next, select the USA or India server location to fake a GPS location.
3. Then clear the cache from the YouTube app and click it open.
4. You should now find the option to view and even upload Shorts from your device.

#### Solution 4\. Ensure your video is set as YouTube Shorts

Your video should be set as YouTube Shorts before posting.

1. Identify the video that you wish to post.
2. Add the “#shorts” in your title and description.
3. See that each video is up to 60 seconds only.
4. Post the video and see whether the issue isn’t reoccurring.

## Conclusion

Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:

Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:
