Unfortunately, according to the [BI Intelligence Digital Trust Survey](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-and-youtube-have-the-most-annoying-ads-by-far-2017-4), YouTube serves up the most annoying ads with 43 percent of the respondents considering YouTube ads most irksome.

Every now and then you’ll get annoyed with the obtrusive ads and ask **how to block YouTube ads**.
