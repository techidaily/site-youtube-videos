There is no social network available online that gives more relevancy, popularity, and engagement than TikTok.

There is no social network available online that gives more relevancy, popularity, and engagement than TikTok.

You can reap multiple benefits if you're a content creator by connecting all your social media platforms.

As for the format, the resolution can only be set to 1080p since TikTok only supports it to utilize the entire canvas.
