## Part 4: 5 Tips for Creating a Great Trailer

### 1\. Let Viewers Know What is Coming

 People appreciate routine. You can mention how many times a week you create content and the days when you publish. You can also have a brief overview of the type of videos you make, which will tell a new viewer what to expect if they subscribe to your channel!

### 2\. Keep It Short

 YouTube trailers that are more than a minute long will not succeed. People have a very short attention span. They want to be hooked immediately. 30 to 45 seconds is the sweet spot, with 30 seconds preferable! It may sound overwhelming to condense everything about your channel into 30 seconds, but that is where a great video script can help! However, sometimes [both short videos and long videos](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/short-form-vs-long-form-video-the-answer-is-sometimes%5Fus%5F595d275ae4b0f078efd98de4) work.

### 3\. Use Some Fun Annotations

 YouTube is great for having unique and helpful graphics on the screen while your video is playing. Having some fun and useful annotations, such as the days you make videos or a subscribe icon, during the intro video can be very helpful to new viewers. They also help to boost viewer engagement with your content!

![annotations channel trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/annotations-channel-trailer.JPG)

### 4\. Assume You Have New Viewers

 Do not create a YouTube channel trailer with inside jokes or comments. This trailer is for people who know nothing about you or your channel. You are trying to hook them into your content, not provide a few laughs to existing subscribers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Update Your Trailer Regularly

 As a content creator, you may find that your brand changes every six months to a year. Maybe you change up your look, type of content, frequency of uploads or other parts of the channel. Ensure you are updating your trailer each time you make significant changes to your channel!

## Part 4: 5 Tips for Creating a Great Trailer

### 1\. Let Viewers Know What is Coming

 People appreciate routine. You can mention how many times a week you create content and the days when you publish. You can also have a brief overview of the type of videos you make, which will tell a new viewer what to expect if they subscribe to your channel!

### 2\. Keep It Short

 YouTube trailers that are more than a minute long will not succeed. People have a very short attention span. They want to be hooked immediately. 30 to 45 seconds is the sweet spot, with 30 seconds preferable! It may sound overwhelming to condense everything about your channel into 30 seconds, but that is where a great video script can help! However, sometimes [both short videos and long videos](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/short-form-vs-long-form-video-the-answer-is-sometimes%5Fus%5F595d275ae4b0f078efd98de4) work.

![annotations channel trailer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/annotations-channel-trailer.JPG)

YouTube verify isn’t just for big channels, it’s for just about anyone serious about YouTube. The main benefits of verifying your channel are live streaming and the ability to publish longer videos. You must also verify your account to apply for monetization, although there are other qualifications for that as well.

## How to verify your YouTube channel

To verify your YouTube channel, start by visiting this link: <https://www.youtube.com/verify>.

You’ll need to provide a phone number. A verification code will be either texted or sent via an automated voice call (your choice). Once you have the code, you just have to enter in the field YouTube provides.
