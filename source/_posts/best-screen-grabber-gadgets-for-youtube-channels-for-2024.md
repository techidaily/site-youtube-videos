### Editing Your Fitness Videos with Filmora

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an efficient video editing software that allows you to cut out the unwanted clips, change the video speed, and add text and titles with templates.

#### 1.  How to Work Out ![YouTube Fitness Video Ideas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fitness-youtube-video-ideas.jpg)

Life is a process of constantly learning how to do new things, and educational videos on YouTube allow us to learn whatever we want. Most people don't know how to exercise properly, which is why people who do are in demand on YouTube. If you have a strong command of good workout techniques, you can produce exercise videos that contain all the information viewers need for better workouts.

#### 2.  Vitamins, Supplements

There is a lot of confusion surrounding the topic of vitamins and food supplements. The internet is full of false prophets that often provide information about this topic that is not based on facts but on profit and their personal interests.

If you have the knowledge required to give instructions to others about fitness, then creating educational YouTube videos in which you share your personal opinions (and experiences) about supplements and vitamins may be a great way to gain more followers.

#### 3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts

No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube's community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.

#### 4.  Stretch Videos

Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.

#### 5.  Full-length Workout Videos

There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.

#### 6.  Yoga Routine

Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can't learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they'll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.

#### 7.  Exercise Plans

We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do. Structuring workouts and giving people a concise plan they should follow when they get to the gym (or in their home) can be beneficial for beginners and experienced athletes alike. These types of videos are ‘evergreen’ – they don’t become dated as time passes so new and returning audiences can continue to appreciate them.

#### 8.  Motivational Video

The lack of motivation is one of the most common reasons people have trouble getting in shape. We have trouble making ourselves start. If you are a motivational figure that can inspire others to establish a healthy lifestyle you could be a hit with this type of video. Develop your own way of motivating people, and strive to create a coherent style that fits your own personal philosophy of life.

#### 9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information

We are what we eat, and in order to stay fit, we must pay attention to everything we take into our system. The vast majority of gym goers don’t really know much about the food they should eat after workouts or how often they should eat. This provides a window of opportunity for you as somebody who does to produce YouTube videos that offer detailed advice on dieting should and regular daily meals for staying healthy and full of energy.

#### 10.  Your Fitness Journey

Every story has a beginning, so creating a video for your YouTube channel that tells the viewers how your fitness journey began and what you had to go through to get where you are can help you develop a deeper bond with your YouTube followers. You can also document the preparation process for a great challenge, like a triathlon or a marathon, and show your followers what your daily exercise routines look like.

#### 11.  Weight Loss Advice

For some people, weight can be a major health concern. A few years ago, the American Medical Association has classified obesity as a disease. That's why YouTube videos that offer advice on how to lose weight in a safe and healthy way, or which provide guidance through the process, can help you build an audience on YouTube.
