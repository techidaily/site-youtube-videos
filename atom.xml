This outstanding video editor works only on Apple devices which includes macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. It embodies excellent tools for a media organization, color grading, soundtracks, and green-screen effects for your videos. To crown it all, it supports a few media formats.</p><p>If your media source is unavailable on your device, it could be since iMovie doesn’t support the format, or it may be under the protection of <strong>Digital Rights Management</strong>.</p><p>Now, even though you’ve downloaded the songs from YouTube to listen to them offline, you are allowed to stream them within the music player only and not apply them to other media forms.</p><p>So, if you want to add YouTube music to iMovie, you must remove the DRM restrictions first before converting the YouTube song to a format supported by iMovie.

However, the process can be a bit technical while the results you are going to get may not be visually impressive.</p><p>The first thing you will need to do is create a new project, and select a photo you are going to use as a background. Once you place the photo onto the timeline and set its duration you can proceed to export it as a video.</p><p>You can skip this step if you want to use a video file you recorded with on your own as the background for the intro. In either case, you will have to import the video files you want to use to make an intro into a project you’re working on and place them on the timeline.</p><p>You can then proceed to create a text box and insert the text you want to appear in the intro. Optionally you can apply transitions between the video clips you included in your intro or add music that matches the intro’s style. Preview the intro to make sure that you like the final result and continue working on other parts of your video.</p><p>You can also check the guide to know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to create video trailers in iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-6"><a href="#Conclusion-6" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An intro can slowly introduce the topic the video covers and it can spark the viewer’s attention.

Once you place the photo onto the timeline and set its duration you can proceed to export it as a video.</p><p>You can skip this step if you want to use a video file you recorded with on your own as the background for the intro.

Optionally you can apply transitions between the video clips you included in your intro or add music that matches the intro’s style. Preview the intro to make sure that you like the final result and continue working on other parts of your video.</p><p>You can also check the guide to know <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to create video trailers in iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An intro can slowly introduce the topic the video covers and it can spark the viewer’s attention.

Click <strong>SAVE</strong> to save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/block-users-youtube-comment.jpg"                      alt=" Block YouTube   commnets "                ></p><h4 id="4-If-I-turn-comments-off-and-back-on-again-will-the-old-comments-come-back-3"><a href="#4-If-I-turn-comments-off-and-back-on-again-will-the-old-comments-come-back-3" class="headerlink" title="4. If I turn comments off and back on again, will the old comments come back?"></a>4. If I turn comments off and back on again, will the old comments come back?</h4><p>Yes. When you turn off the comments, the existing comments disappear. When you turn them back on, all the previous comments reappear, and become visible to the audience.</p><h4 id="5-If-I-change-my-comment-settings-will-the-existing-comments-be-impacted-3"><a href="#5-If-I-change-my-comment-settings-will-the-existing-comments-be-impacted-3" class="headerlink" title="5. If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?"></a>5. If I change my comment settings, will the existing comments be impacted?</h4><p>That depends on the nature of the comments. For instance, if you modify the settings, the changes are reflected on the comments posted on the new videos, and the new comments on your channel homepage. However, there will be no impact on the existing comments on the existing videos, new comments on the existing videos, and the existing comments on your channel’s homepage.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>It is easy to understand <strong>how to turn on comments on YouTube</strong>. The best thing is, the comments are enabled by default, and if you don’t need them, you can simply disable them by configuring the videos or the entire channel as ‘Made for kids’. If the comments on any video were enabled previously, and are disabled later on, the existing comments automatically disappear. They reappear when the comments on the video are reenabled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

According to YouTube’s aspect ratio, it’s the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?</h2><p>For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we’ve come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.</p><p>It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>240p:</strong> 426x240 pixels</li><li><strong>360p:</strong> 640x360 pixels</li><li><strong>480p:</strong> 854x480 pixels</li><li><strong>720p:</strong> 1280x720 pixels</li><li><strong>1080p:</strong> 1920x1080 pixels</li><li><strong>1440p:</strong> 2560x1440 pixels</li><li><strong>2160p:</strong> 3840x2160 pixels</li><li><strong>43200p:</strong> 7680×4320 pixels</li></ul><p>Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.</p><p>Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to <strong>resize YouTube video</strong> is perfect as 16:9, which we’ll diversify in the following three sections.</p><p><strong>1. Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it’s square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.</p><p><strong>3. iPad &amp; iPhone</strong></p><p>Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it’s square, horizontal, or vertical.</p><p>Before we let you know how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong>, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.</li><li>Search for ideas and topics.</li><li>Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.</li><li>Ensure the best YouTube video editing.</li><li>Optimize YouTube videos.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac"></a>Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac</h2><p>Hopefully, you have noted the correct aspect ratio required for YouTube videos.

Dailymotion gives you a golden opportunity and platform to share your videos on websites other than YouTube. This means that you can transfer your videos from YouTube to dailymotion in few minutes and increase the audience. There is no direct transfer feature in YouTube and hence this post will help in guiding how can you transfer the video content from YouTube to Dailymotion!</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion</a></li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads.

All you have to do is to login to your YouTube official account and download all the videos that you have uploaded in MP4 format by clicking on Edit option appearing at right of the video.</p><p>Ready to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download YouTube Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s easy, fun and a great way to share your movies with the world.</p><p>Save it to the desired folder on your PC and navigate to the Dailymotion account page. Sign in with your credentials and click on upload video. Browse the video from the location where you saved, give it a title and description.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-uploading.jpg"                      alt="dailymotion-uploading"                ></p><p>Next, click on channel drop-down menu and choose a category which best describes your video. Besides this, you would see a ‘Tags’ text box. You can add one or more tags (maximum 10) and select the privacy options as per your requirement. Tags act as a criterion for SEO optimization and help people in finding your video. Finally, just click on save to upload the video on dailymotion.</p><h2 id="Method-2-Sync-YouTube-videos-to-Dailymotion"><a href="#Method-2-Sync-YouTube-videos-to-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion"></a>Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion</h2><p>You can do this by liaising with Freedom MCN Network as it allows you to grow faster on Dailymotion. All you have to do is to search for ‘dashboard.tm’ on Google and sign in using you email and password. It will direct you to Dailymotion page; you can also opt to sign in with your Facebook credentials. When you will press enter and login, the first screen only will show the prompt if you want to synch YouTube and Dailymotion channels? Since, our answer is yes, the screen will ask you to login into your YouTube account and the screen will navigate you to the login into Google account linked to your YouTube account. Just like in all apps, you have to allow Freedom to access the data from your YouTube account. The next screen will list down number of videos that have been uploaded to your YouTube Account and the ones which are already synched with Dailymotion will have a check against their name.

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1.

With that claim, it can help any new YouTuber find and grow their audience. It doesn’t matter if their channel is about fashion or karate, Facebook is an appropriate platform for interacting with the audience, as long as the content you share is relevant and click-worthy.</p><p>There are a number of ways to share content on Facebook:</p><p>- Sharing on your own personal timeline allows your Friends to see the content.</p><p>- Sharing directly to a particular group or person’s feed assures those in the group or that specific person will see the content.</p><p>- Sharing via a separate Page you’ve built for your YouTube channel allows those who are following the page to see the content.</p><h4 id="1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook"><a href="#1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="1.

While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p><p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p><p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share YouTube on Facebook 2"                ></p><p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com.

Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s.

Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p><p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p><h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page" class="headerlink" title="3.

Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day.

Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place.

For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content.

Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat.

Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat.

If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-1"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p><p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p><p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life-1"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

This allows you to connect with your audience as they discover more about you, so when it comes time for the YouTube video, they feel that have an established relationship with you.</p><p>They see your picture or video on their feed every day after all. You and your followers are practically friends.</p><p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p><h3 id="How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-1"><a href="#How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-1" class="headerlink" title="How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed"></a>How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed</h3><p>When you post an image or a video onto Instagram directly it will be on your timeline and acts as a tile for your whole Instagram feed page. This piece of content will stay on your page forever, or until you delete it.</p><p>Like your YouTube videos, the content you post to your Instagram directly should have a cohesive theme that matches your branding. Keep an eye on your: -</p><p>- Aesthetic</p><p>- Caption</p><p>- Filter</p><p>As Instagram has grown in popularity, a lot of tools have been developed to help creators like yourself. Here are a few apps that you can include in your kit:</p><p>- <a href="https://vsco.co/"><strong>VSCO</strong></a>: A photo editor app that will allow you to clean up and enhance details to really make your visuals pop.</p><p>- <a href="https://unum.la/"><strong>UNUM</strong></a>: An Instagram planner app that enables you to visualize and pre-plan your post.</p><p>- <a href="https://later.com/"><strong>Later</strong></a>: A scheduling tool you can use to auto-publish to directly to Instagram.</p><p>- <a href="https://www.planoly.com/"><strong>Planoly</strong></a>: Drag and drop scheduler and planner, allows you to see the whole grid before posting.</p><p>Here’s Liza Koshy’s Instagram feed.

You don’t want someone to end up on your Instagram page and only see selfies or inspiring quotes.</p><p>You won’t know which type of content will hook your next fan… so experiment.</p><p>When you post onto Instagram directly, you can’t add a are unable to link in the caption. This has been a bane for marketers and creators since the beginning of Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-2.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample 2"                ></p><p><em>Instagram: Pointless Blog</em></p><p>While Instagram is a great engagement platform, it hasn’t been the best channel for those who want to have a direct call to action.

Use Instagram Story to Make an Announcement</h4><p>While you are uploading your latest video to YouTube, go on Instagram Story and let your followers know.</p><p>Unlike posting directly to the Instagram timeline, once you reach a certain milestone, Instagram Story allows you to create a link right in the content. The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content. By doing so, you redirect them from Instagram to your YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-feed-4.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Feed sample 4"                ></p><p><em>Instagram: Jenn Im</em></p><p>Don’t think of Instagram Story as simply a mean for promoting your video, but a chance to give your loyal viewers an exclusive view into your process, allow them to get familiar with your personality and increase the exposure of your brand as a whole, solidifying your relationship.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-2-Facebook-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 2: Facebook for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Facebook is the world’s most popular social media platform. With that claim, it can help any new YouTuber find and grow their audience. It doesn’t matter if their channel is about fashion or karate, Facebook is an appropriate platform for interacting with the audience, as long as the content you share is relevant and click-worthy.</p><p>There are a number of ways to share content on Facebook:</p><p>- Sharing on your own personal timeline allows your Friends to see the content.</p><p>- Sharing directly to a particular group or person’s feed assures those in the group or that specific person will see the content.</p><p>- Sharing via a separate Page you’ve built for your YouTube channel allows those who are following the page to see the content.</p><h4 id="1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook-1"><a href="#1-Improve-YouTube-Video-Thumbnail-on-Facebook-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Unremarkable. While your audience can still view the video on the Facebook timeline, your fans scrolling by wouldn’t even notice it.</p><p>This is Facebook’s way of encouraging you to post videos directly to Facebook’s platform. Which is something you should consider as well, but as you are currently working to grow your YouTube channel, it’s good to focus on this task first.</p><p>Well, how do you make the post look better? There is a tool called<a class="link"   href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share YouTube on Facebook 2"                ></p><p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com.

Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s.

Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p><p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p><h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-1"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-1"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p><p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends.

Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place. Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-1"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content.

Understanding these rules will help you understand the purpose of this community.</p><p>Here is an example of reddiquettes for r&#x2F;Cameras:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reddit-community-guideline-sample.jpg"                      alt="reddit community guideline sample"                ></p><p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p><p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p><h4 id="4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely-1"><a href="#4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely</h4><p>While there are some subreddits that demand relevant content, some subreddits will allow you post your videos as long as 90% of your content are from another source aside from your YouTube channel, you won’t be considered spammy.</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p><p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there. Then again, you’ll never know.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>If your audience craves immediacy and exclusivity, then Snapchat is definitely the social media channel that you’d want to explore.</p><p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-1"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-2"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

Using Bite-sized Snackable Content on Instagram</h4><p>Images and one-minute long videos can engage with your users, help them work up an appetite for your videos, and direct them to your YouTube channel for more.</p><p>The great thing about Instagram — compared to YouTube — is that it’s easier to produce content for Instagram every day without exhausting your resources.</p><p>Be thinking about what you can post on to Instagram while you work on your YouTube video. You want a really attractive image or short video, which can be something you capture as you work on your long-form video: short preview or behind the scenes footage.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="2-Share-Your-Life-2"><a href="#2-Share-Your-Life-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

You and your followers are practically friends.</p><p>While Instagram has multiple ways you can post onto the platform, we will talk about two very different strategies:</p><h3 id="How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-2"><a href="#How-YouTubers-Should-Post-on-Instagram-Feed-2" class="headerlink" title="How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed"></a>How YouTubers Should Post on Instagram Feed</h3><p>When you post an image or a video onto Instagram directly it will be on your timeline and acts as a tile for your whole Instagram feed page.

Keep an eye on your: -</p><p>- Aesthetic</p><p>- Caption</p><p>- Filter</p><p>As Instagram has grown in popularity, a lot of tools have been developed to help creators like yourself.

The ability to offer something timely and encourage the viewer to swipe up is a fantastic way to catch your audience when they are most interested in your content.

Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-2"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin.

As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p><p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p><h4 id="1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-2"><a href="#1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place. Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-2"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-2"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-2"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

However, until you have established a big following on YouTube, only a few people are going to see your freshly published video… unless you share on social media.</p><p>So don’t relax yet, it’s time to spread the word about your video and channel on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and Reddit.</p><p>Why is social media the best place to share your YouTube video? Let’s take a quick look at the <a class="link"   href="https://www.dreamgrow.com/top-15-most-popular-social-networking-sites/" >statistics of some of the biggest social platforms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the world:</p><p>- Facebook has <strong>over 2.1 billion</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Instagram has approximately <strong>800 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Twitter has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Reddit has approximately <strong>330 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>- Snapchat has approximately <strong>200 million</strong> monthly active users.</p><p>While your loyal viewers might watch your videos on YouTube, YouTube might not be the platform they spend the most time on.</p><p>Start by understanding your audience. If your YouTube channel is discussing fan theories for a popular television show, then Twitter and Reddit should be where you direct your efforts. If you are creating video content that has a lot of visual appeal, like travel or photography, then Instagram and Snapchat are better for cross-promotional content.</p><p>By promoting on the right social platform, there’s a better chance of discoverability. Additionally, branding that is consistent across all social media increases the trust among your viewers. Consistency does not mean simply putting the YouTube video onto Instagram or sharing it on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Content is not one-size fits all!</strong></p><p>Regardless of what platform your viewers are spending most of their time on, it’s important to understand how the community interacts. Sharing your video content on Facebook is different than on Reddit. What may be okay on one platform may come across as spam in another.</p><p>In this post, we will go through the best practices of sharing and engaging with your audience on 5 of the most popular social media channels.</p><p><strong>Table of Content:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="#Instagram">Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#Facebook">Facebook</a></li><li><a href="#Twitter">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="#Reddit">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="#Snapchat">Snapchat</a></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-media-marketing-tips-for-youtuber.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Social Media Marketing Strategy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 1: Instagram for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>There is a lot of content today and therefore, audiences are more selective about how they choose to spend their time.</p><p>Take this example: Before you go to the theater to watch a movie, you might see a poster or a trailer first.</p><p>A movie poster lets you know this movie is coming to theatres and the trailer gives you a taste of what to expect before you buy the ticket and sit in the theater for two hours. If the promotional materials don’t entice, you wouldn’t go see the movie.</p><p>Instagram can work much in the same way for your YouTube channel. Your Instagram account can be a platform for attracting new viewers and hyping up your loyal following.</p><h4 id="1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-3"><a href="#1-Using-Bite-sized-Snackable-Content-on-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

There is a tool called<a class="link"   href="https://thumbtube.com/" >Thumb Tube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that gives you full sized image on Facebook:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-youtube-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Share YouTube on Facebook 2"                ></p><p>Thumb Tube takes your YouTube video link and redirects it so it is now hosted on ThumbTube.com. Yet, anyone viewing the video there is watching on YouTube, not Facebook. This allows you to still capture all the views, likes, and comments on YouTube.</p><h3 id="1-Managing-a-Facebook-Page-for-Your-YouTube-Channel-3"><a href="#1-Managing-a-Facebook-Page-for-Your-YouTube-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel"></a>1. Managing a Facebook Page for Your YouTube Channel</h3><p>Know this, Facebook has been around for over a decade, and establishing yourself on the social network in 2018 is not what it was like in the late ‘00s. Hard truths: building a following from scratch is going to be a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard-3"><a href="#1-Growing-on-Facebook-is-Hard-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Growing on Facebook is Hard"></a>1. Growing on Facebook is Hard</h4><p>Before you go and start committing yourself to Facebook, consider your capacity and your audience: are you able to dedicate time and effort on Facebook? Is this the best platform to reach your viewers?</p><p>So Facebook is for you. How should you approach it?</p><h4 id="2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-3"><a href="#2-Setup-a-Facebook-Page-for-your-YouTube-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel"></a>2. Setup a Facebook Page for your YouTube Channel</h4><p>This separates your personal account from your channel, allowing you to still have some autonomy. You don’t necessarily want your fans to be your friends… On top of that, having a separate page for your channel enables you to keep a consistent branding, which is important in getting more likes and subscribers.</p><p>To set up a separate Facebook Page:</p><p>1. Go to Facebook, and click “Pages” in the right-hand column</p><ol><li>Click “Create Pages”</li><li>Let Facebook know whether your Page will be classified as a “Business or Brand” or a “Community or Public Figure”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-page.jpg"                      alt="create facebook page"                ></p><ol><li>Name your Page, preferably your YouTube channel name</li><li>Add Profile and Cover pictures<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-page-settings.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Page settings"                ></li><li>INVITE!</li></ol><p>Treat your Facebook Page like another homepage for your channel. Landing on your page might be the first interaction the audience will have with your brand, so it is important that it is similar to your YouTube channel. This means, the logo has to match, the descriptions need to be aligned, and the cover photo should somewhat resemble your YouTube channel art.</p><p>Once you are confident that all the Facebook elements are consistent, it’s time to start marketing.</p><h4 id="3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-3"><a href="#3-Invite-Your-Facebook-Friends-to-Like-Your-Page-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page"></a>3. Invite Your Facebook Friends to Like Your Page</h4><p>Your circle of friends will give you your initial burst needed to grow your YouTube channel, as they like and comment on your videos. The more engagement you get, the more impressions your post will earn not just from your friends, but from your friends’ friends. This expands your network.</p><p>However, don’t post the same thing over and over again. It’ll come across as spam to your followers, and it’ll also look lazy if someone lands on your page and see the same piece of content repeated on your news feed.</p><p><strong>Facebook is best if you are consistently sharing a variety of content related to your channel.</strong></p><p>This does not mean you have to be creating them all. If you were to post five times a week, perhaps only one of the post can be originally created by you. Curate content (i.e. blog, infographics, podcasts, images) that matches your audience’s interest. By always having engaging content that your fans are eager to like, share, and comment, this will give your videos more exposure when it is time to share it.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Save time by scheduling your Facebook content ahead of time. By batching your Facebook content to be uploaded in one sitting, you can have a week to a month of content prepped ahead of time, so you can go back to focusing on YouTube.</p><p>Managing Facebook as a channel to build your YouTube audience can be very effective, but it is a lot of work in itself.</p><p>Managing Facebook involves:</p><p>- Posting content</p><p>- Responding to comments</p><p>- Engaging with Facebook groups</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TubeRitual/" >Tube Ritual <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Video Marketing YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyandtheVlog/" >Beauty and the Vlog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Fashion and Beauty YouTube Group)</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/TravelVloggersUnited" >Travel Vloggers United <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Travel YouTube Group)</p><p>- Evaluating performance repeatedly</p><p>Don’t spread yourself too thin. If YouTube is your priority, all other social media communities should be complementary, not an obligation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Twitter-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Part-3-Twitter-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Twitter for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 3: Twitter for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Unlike Facebook or Instagram, Twitter is a platform where you must be ready with a large amount of valuable content to share, otherwise, you will be lost in the noise. Don’t be afraid to tweet similar content throughout a day. As long as it is done well and isn’t misleading viewers, it wouldn’t be considered spam.</p><p>Twitter allows you to get in front of some of the most influential people on the Internet and stay on top of global trends. It is not always easy to get noticed on Twitter, but when your content really resonates, it’s also hard to be ignored.</p><h4 id="1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-3"><a href="#1-Take-Advantage-of-Trending-Hashtags-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags"></a>1. Take Advantage of Trending Hashtags</h4><p>In order to be successful on Twitter, you must be ready to jump onto a relevant trend. If you are talking about something that nobody is interested in, you might not be heard at all. Keep an eye on the most popular hashtags for that day and get involved with a conversation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-advantage-of-trending-hashtags.jpg"                      alt="take advantage of Twitter hashtag"                ></p><p>While you should definitely tweet and gain engagement for your YouTube videos, you will also need to tweet out other content.</p><p>Constantly keeping an eye on what the world is talking about gives you an idea of what is important to discuss. This may even help guide your next YouTube video.</p><h4 id="2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers-3"><a href="#2-Tag-Brands-and-Influencers-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Tag Brands and Influencers"></a>2. Tag Brands and Influencers</h4><p>Twitter is a great platform if your channel showcases brands, personalities, or influencers because it gives you the ability to get in front of them. Getting a big brand or an influencer to share your video can earn you a lot more Twitter followers as well as a lot more views to your channel.</p><p>An effective way for YouTubers to use Twitter is to be active during an event. If you know that the event will get a lot of attention and the content you are producing is relevant to that audience, then use the official hashtag, tag an attendee, and get that crowd who are actively engaged during the duration of the event to view your videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tag-brand-influencer-twitter.jpg"                      alt="Tag brand and influencer"                ></p><p><em>Creators sharing their thoughts on #VidCon</em></p><p>Connecting with people with a lot of clouts can increase your credibility on the topic you are covering.</p><p>However, in order for these high-influence people to notice your YouTube channel via Twitter, you must commit to building your Twitter account and audience.</p><p>If your Twitter account looks amateurish, for example: if you display picture is still an egg, then any attempts at reaching out to these big brands and influencers will be a loss. Stay active and over time you will gain a following to support you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Part-4-Reddit-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 4: Reddit for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>Reddit for YouTube creators can be an intimidating place. Reddit users (Redditors) can sniff out marketing material or misleading click-baits.</p><p>You can commit this sin on other platform and get away with it, but on Reddit, this type of posting at best will not be ignored and at worst roasted alive in front of the whole platform.</p><p>Because of the anonymity of Reddit’s user base, the comments for posts are often unfiltered.</p><h4 id="1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-3"><a href="#1-Good-Content-Gets-Seen-and-Discussed-On-Reddit-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit"></a>1. Good Content Gets Seen and Discussed On Reddit</h4><p>If you can tap into the community values of Reddit, contribute to conversations and share interesting and relevant content there might not be a better platform to grow your YouTube audience.</p><p>Many media organizations with a significant following are starting to <a class="link"   href="https://medium.com/@davelee/a-journalists-guide-to-reddit-your-newest-super-source-fa250e967b97" >use Reddit to find stories and viral content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The chances of being discovered on Reddit is much higher than on Twitter, as the upvote&#x2F;downvote system gives your good work a higher platform to stand on while lowering the bad content to Reddit’s cellar.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself-3"><a href="#2-Don’t-Promote-Yourself-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Promote Yourself"></a>2. Don’t Promote Yourself</h4><p>Reddit is not a platform where you enter, drop your content in, and expect people to engage with it. For Redditors, this is intrusive and unappreciated.</p><p>Imagine being at a party and talking to your friends, and then someone you don’t know comes in and starts a conversation about the latest movie, singing a song and asking for feedback, or discussing the coolest restaurants in town. That would be annoying, right?</p><p>You cannot go into Reddit blasting your content, because it wasn’t welcomed content.</p><p>Before you can get people on Reddit to care about your YouTube channel, you must show them that you care about them — the community.</p><p>From day one, you need to be a part of the community, and your reason for being a part of the community cannot be because you want to share content. If you have a hidden agenda, you will be discovered.</p><h4 id="3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-3"><a href="#3-Understand-the-Reddiquettes-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Understand the Reddiquettes"></a>3. Understand the Reddiquettes</h4><p>When engaging on Reddit, you must abide by rules which are called “reddiquette.” There are global reddiquettes and then there are individual community reddiquette.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette"><strong>Global reddiquettes</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><p>- Search for duplicate content before posting.</p><p>- Consume the content before voting.</p><p>- Act as you would in real life.</p><p>- And more.</p><h4 id="3-Community-reddiquettes-3"><a href="#3-Community-reddiquettes-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Community reddiquettes"></a>3. Community reddiquettes</h4><p>These are additional rules that the individual Reddit communities enforce. Be sure to read these rules before posting onto these specific communities. Understanding these rules will help you understand the purpose of this community.</p><p>Here is an example of reddiquettes for r&#x2F;Cameras:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reddit-community-guideline-sample.jpg"                      alt="reddit community guideline sample"                ></p><p>You only have so many strikes with Reddit before your account gets banned. But don’t worry about all that. Be your awesome self.</p><p>When you are on Reddit, don’t think of yourself as a YouTuber, think of yourself as a redditor, if you do, you’ll have a bright future on the platform.</p><h4 id="4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely-3"><a href="#4-Subreddits-Where-You-Can-Post-Freely-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely"></a>4. Subreddits Where You Can Post Freely</h4><p>While there are some subreddits that demand relevant content, some subreddits will allow you post your videos as long as 90% of your content are from another source aside from your YouTube channel, you won’t be considered spammy.</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YouTuber</strong>: Get critiques for your videos</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;Videos</strong>: Post any video into the masses</p><p><strong>- r&#x2F;YTPL</strong>: Share a whole playlist</p><p>Because these subreddits are unfocused and loaded with a variety of content, it’s often tricky to find your specific audience there. Then again, you’ll never know.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3"><a href="#Part-5-Snapchat-for-YouTube-Channel-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing"></a>Part 5: Snapchat for YouTube Channel Marketing</h2><p>If your audience craves immediacy and exclusivity, then Snapchat is definitely the social media channel that you’d want to explore.</p><p>The ephemeral nature of Snapchat makes it a unique way of marketing your content as what you snap will only be available within 24 hours. Because what you post will only be available for a brief moment in time, those who are following you will dedicate their attention to your content knowing that if they miss it, they might never see it again.</p><p>This undivided attention cannot be recreated on Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit, as users can easily scroll pass your content.</p><p>The key is to get your audience a personalized experience on your Snapchat. What can you offer on Snapchat that they can’t get elsewhere?</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-3"><a href="#1-Don’t-Worry-About-Professionalism-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism"></a>1. Don’t Worry About Professionalism</h4><p>Snapchat is young, fun, and silly. On Snapchat, your personality needs to be the fuel for your content.</p><p>Pull the curtains open and welcome your audience through the private window into your life. Treat your Snapchat audience less as a faceless crowd but as your friends and family. Take them on a private tour, show them unseen footage of your video, and don’t be afraid to use the filters, text, and theme to liven up your content.</p><p>Start following some <a class="link"   href="https://vidooly.com/blog/youtubers-on-snapchat" >popular YouTubers on Snapchat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and you can quickly see how they are using it. Don’t use Snapchat as a place to perform, but instead a place for you to be spontaneous. Remember these content don’t last forever, so don’t take forever planning it out, just start doing it.  </p><p>Promoting your Snapchat account can be hard if you are not a celebrity. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, there is no in-app discovery or suggested users feature in Snapchat. The user will have to search for who they want to follow. Unless someone already knows about you, it’s unlikely that they will be following you on Snapchat. This makes promoting your account to your viewers essential for growth.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote-account-to-get-views.jpg"                      alt="promote account to get views"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Markiplier tweeting his Snapchat username.</em></p><p>Here are a few quick tips for promoting your Snapchat account.</p><p>- Make sure your Snapchat handle is present on your YouTube channel and other social media platforms.</p><p>- Make your<a class="link"   href="https://blackatlascreative.com/blog/how-do-snapchats-snapcodes-work/" >Snapchat snapcode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>your profile pic, so people can scan and connect with you.</p><p>- Get other Snapchatters to give you a shout-out on their account.</p><p>Marketing on social media is essential for not only growing your YouTube channel but your entire brand.

Likewise, your ranking will start escalating as compared to a content creator who hasn’t reached the 1,000-subscriber level.</p><h2 id="How-to-get-1000-subscribers-for-your-YouTube-channel-3"><a href="#How-to-get-1000-subscribers-for-your-YouTube-channel-3" class="headerlink" title="How to get 1000 subscribers for your YouTube channel?"></a>How to get 1000 subscribers for your YouTube channel?</h2><p>Now that you’ve seen what comes with 1K subscribers, our focus is to find ways to get to that number.</p><h4 id="1-Consider-your-audience-first-not-revenue-3"><a href="#1-Consider-your-audience-first-not-revenue-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Consider your audience first, not revenue"></a>1) Consider your audience first, not revenue</h4><p>Remember, it’s the audience that will help you generate revenue. So, if you are a new creator, think of what you can give to your audience instead of what you are getting. What is of value to your audience is more important as they’ll hang around your channel for passion. You can take advantage and tune your ideas to what most viewers like to get.</p><h4 id="2-Put-in-resources-to-encourage-subscriber-sign-ups-3"><a href="#2-Put-in-resources-to-encourage-subscriber-sign-ups-3" class="headerlink" title="2) Put in resources to encourage subscriber sign-ups"></a>2) Put in resources to encourage subscriber sign-ups</h4><p>Focus on getting traffic to your channel. There are several ways to encourage your viewers to subscribe, such as the use of animations on videos. It will not only attract their attention, but you’ll realize many viewers coming over. Several resources are available over the net. Just find what suits you best, or use several options to see which gig fetches the most clicks.</p><h4 id="3-Properly-advertise-your-videos-3"><a href="#3-Properly-advertise-your-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Properly advertise your videos"></a>3) Properly advertise your videos</h4><p>The best way to get more users to subscribe to your channel is to engage them. Make the videos enticing such that when a user views one video, they end up clicking and viewing the next 5 or 10 of your other videos. Let it be enticing and corresponds to the topic of the moment.</p><h4 id="4-Add-a-good-channel-description-3"><a href="#4-Add-a-good-channel-description-3" class="headerlink" title="4) Add a good channel description"></a>4) Add a good channel description</h4><p>A viewer should know what your channel is all about just by a glance.

More so, make it simple to understand so that they don’t waste time trying to figure out what your channel is about.</p><h4 id="5-Focus-on-YouTube-content-that-works-3"><a href="#5-Focus-on-YouTube-content-that-works-3" class="headerlink" title="5) Focus on YouTube content that works"></a>5) Focus on YouTube content that works</h4><p>Put double efforts into the content that works for you.

After an introduction and putting up memorable videos, ensure you remind your viewers to subscribe to your channel. You can add a subscribe button to the end of the screen.

Your pinned comment will appear at the top of the comment list, whereby everyone who has watched the video can’t miss coming across it. It is good, to be honest, and asking for them to subscribe is the best you can do after an engaging video shot.</p><h4 id="8-Add-value-to-other-channels-3"><a href="#8-Add-value-to-other-channels-3" class="headerlink" title="8) Add value to other channels"></a>8) Add value to other channels</h4><p>Don’t be selfish and want users to subscribe to your channel for nothing.

Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.</p><p>When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot" class="headerlink" title="5. Compose the Shot"></a><strong>5. Compose the Shot</strong></h2><p>Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.</p><p>In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.</p><p>The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the basics of video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Check out this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q" >Rosanna Pansino <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where she gives a tour of her bedroom.</p><p> The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Prepared"><a href="#6-Be-Prepared" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Prepared"></a><strong>6. Be Prepared</strong></h2><p>While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.</p><p>Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…</p><p>Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.</p><p>Take a look at <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w" >Ashley Nichole <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.</p><h2 id="7-Be-Expressive"><a href="#7-Be-Expressive" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Expressive"></a><strong>7. Be Expressive</strong></h2><p>Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.</p><p>If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance.

Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.</p><p>When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic-1"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story-1"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience-1"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting-1"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot-1"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

Compose the Shot</strong></h2><p>Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.</p><p>In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.</p><p>The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the basics of video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Check out this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q" >Rosanna Pansino <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where she gives a tour of her bedroom.</p><p> The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to.

Like any skill, it takes practice to improve. When someone is good at vlogging, they make it look easy.</p><p>When we watch the most popular YouTubers, the traits that make them successful are often invisible, because we are so consumed by their vlog. In this article, I’ll highlight 8 tips from the most accomplished vloggers on the Internet, so that you can vlog confidently and make the best YouTube videos.</p><h2 id="1-Be-Authentic-3"><a href="#1-Be-Authentic-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Authentic"></a><strong>1. Be Authentic</strong></h2><p>People opt to watch vlogs because they want to see something real.</p><p>Vlogging is about honesty, telling a story that is truthful and showing your personality. The most popular vloggers are likable because they don’t deceive the audience, they befriend them. Vloggers treat their audience with respect and that comes from being honest.</p><p>There will be an urge for you to mimic other vloggers, talking and acting the way they do, but savvy YouTube viewers will be able to see your faux personality pretty quickly.</p><p>Don’t focus on your image, but instead focus on your voice. What makes you different? That is how you will build a proper reputation.</p><h2 id="2-Tell-A-Story-3"><a href="#2-Tell-A-Story-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Tell A Story"></a><strong>2. Tell A Story</strong></h2><p>A vlog is not an assortment of footage haphazardly put together. A successful vlog must have a story: a conflict told with a beginning, middle, and end.</p><p>When you are casually telling a story to a friend, you are not thinking about the structure or the plot. You are focused on what happened and you want to communicate it as accurately as you can. While vlogging, you should approach it much the same way. Ad-libbing is fine. Stumbling is fine. Going back and repeating a part of the story is fine. By simply getting your story on camera, you now have all the pieces.</p><p>Once all the pieces of the story are captured — including your storytelling, b-roll, and other supportive footage — you must now cut out all the irrelevant or repetitive parts and edit it so it can be enjoyed as one cohesive tale.</p><p>Take a look at this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TiffanyAlvord" >Tiffany Alvord <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and notice how there are jump cuts both to skip information that can be assumed by the audience and add the tension to the story she’s telling.</p><h2 id="3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#3-Surprise-and-Delight-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience"></a><strong>3. Surprise and Delight Your Audience</strong></h2><p>There is a saying that a great ending to a story is that it is <a class="link"   href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kudler/writing-the-inevitable-bu%5Fb%5F1630419.html" >surprising, yet inevitable <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The ending needs to be justified even if there is a twist. Everything before that had worked to build up the tension and when it concludes it needs to be logical. However, the ending cannot be something that the audience can guess. Remember those mystery movies where you know who the murderer is after the first few scenes? Yeah… those aren’t satisfying. A good story ends with a surprise, and with everything prior leading up to it.</p><p>The gold standard example of a surprising, yet inevitable end is Casey Neistat’s bike lane video. Everything in the video is leading up to the end, but when you watch it the first time it’s unexpected, and that’s why it’s so good.</p><h2 id="4-Be-Inviting-3"><a href="#4-Be-Inviting-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Inviting"></a><strong>4. Be Inviting</strong></h2><p>A common trait of successful vloggers is that they are welcoming. They share their passion and encourage others to join in. Vlogging is about being a guide. It doesn’t matter if you are leading a tour of your home or showing your viewer an interesting new skill, it is important for you to approach the whole process with open arms.</p><p>Unlike being invited to a party, there is no obligation when it comes to YouTube. Your viewers can continue to live vicariously through you or they may be inspired by your experience and dare to try it themselves.</p><p>The opposite of inviting is rejecting, and when you are a vlogger, you don’t want to reject anyone from enjoying your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Compose-the-Shot-3"><a href="#5-Compose-the-Shot-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Compose the Shot"></a><strong>5. Compose the Shot</strong></h2><p>Vlogging is a visual medium, and while the story is important, what is captured in the frame will play an impactful role in the video as well.</p><p>In a way, every vlogger needs to have a director’s eye for cinematography. I’m not saying that you need to be Wes Anderson to be an awesome vlogger, but knowing what is in the frame with you, the angle of the shot, the movement of the camera, and the quality of light will help the product look better.</p><p>The great thing about vlogging is that you will get a lot of practice framing shots, so I encourage you to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the basics of video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Check out this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwmbv6NE4mOh8Z8VhPUx1Q" >Rosanna Pansino <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, where she gives a tour of her bedroom.</p><p> The camera follows her fluidly throughout the video, but it is her eyes that guide both the camera moves and what she wants our attention to be directed to. Don’t hesitate to let the viewer know what you want them to see.</p><h2 id="6-Be-Prepared-3"><a href="#6-Be-Prepared-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Be Prepared"></a><strong>6. Be Prepared</strong></h2><p>While you can pick up a camera and start vlogging on the fly, being prepared enables you to produce the best video possible. Take a few minutes before you hit record simply to outline the key points you want to talk about and how the video will end, ensuring that after filming you haven’t forgotten a crucial part.</p><p>Additionally, knowing what to say makes you a better host for your vlog. Watch your favorite vlogger, I bet when they are speaking on camera, their speech is not littered with umms and ahhs…</p><p>Good preparation includes having all your gear ready for filming when you need it. There is nothing worse than being set to shoot and running out of battery or memory.</p><p>Take a look at <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GTe3Wn7dtWXf3B%5Fv5gm9w" >Ashley Nichole <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in this vlog and notice that although she sounds spontaneous, it is also evident that she knows what she is going to talk about next.</p><h2 id="7-Be-Expressive-3"><a href="#7-Be-Expressive-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Be Expressive"></a><strong>7. Be Expressive</strong></h2><p>Remember those teachers that drone on and on, without adding any expression or passion to what they are lecturing? While they might have been perfectly suitable as teachers, they wouldn’t make good vloggers.</p><p>If you speak on camera in a monotone voice, you are not being expressive. Your facial and body language will match your lackluster performance. Even if you are talking about something you are excited about, if your demeanor doesn’t match that, then the video is going to be lifeless. Vlogging is a presentation, a performance. There needs to be energy.</p><p>Consider your audience: they are coming home from school or work, where there were classes and meetings, and the last thing they want to watch is a video of your speaking without energy.</p><p>Want to see a vlogger that is awesome at being expressive on camera? Check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC78cxCAcp7JfQPgKxYdyGrg" >Emma Chamberlain <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, if you haven’t already. Every word she says in her video is layered with emotion. We know exactly how she feels.</p><h2 id="8-Stay-Organized-3"><a href="#8-Stay-Organized-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Stay Organized"></a><strong>8. Stay Organized</strong></h2><p>The same way you should prepare before filming, it’s also important to be organized comes the editing phase. Editing is arguably the most time-consuming part of the vlogging process, so have a system for categorizing and finding your footages.</p><p>This is especially important when you have multiple video and audio files and if you are capturing footage over a number of days or in different locations.</p><p>Additionally, while filming your vlog, you are going to mess up. It’s also helpful to add a cue after you messed up, this can be a sound cue that causes the levels to spike (clapping or snapping your fingers work) or a video cue such as a dramatic gesture to the camera. When skipping through your footage to find the part where you messed up, later on, it’s easier to have a mark to help you locate it.</p><p>Vlogging is hard, so don’t make more work for yourself. Learn little tricks to make life easier for yourself at every step.</p><p>The more organized you are the more attention you can put into the creative aspect of vlogging, and less time finding a video file or syncing audio to video.</p><p>There you have it, 8 tips to help you vlog like the pros. Anyone can vlog. But only until you point a camera at yourself in public for the first time, do you realize how uncomfortable vlogging can be.</p><p>Even filming yourself in your room with the door closed — and nobody is in the house with you — can be a challenge for beginning vloggers.

This applies the effect to the entire video that you’ve selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/youtube-slow-motion.png"                      alt="slow motion youtube video"                ></p><p>If you just want to slow down parts of the video, go back to the main editing tab, clip it from the original video using the slicing tool and add the slow-motion effect to that clip only. You can then arrange the different clips you have in the editor to create your final video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tick the option “Preview effects side-by-side” with original video and then you can see how the original video plays compared to the one you’ve slowed down. If you’re happy with the result, hit “Done” to save the settings.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Above are the 3 ways that you can watch a YouTube video in slow motion, and slow down YouTube videos. You can directly change the playback speed of the YouTube video on Youtube, or download the YouTube video first and then slow down the speed of the YouTube video with some video editing software for YouTube like Filmora. No matter which way you prefer, we hope these information can help you slow down youtube videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img

Make sure you have even light over your whole face by ‘front lighting’ your vlog. Front lighting means having a light source right in front of you.</p><p>Depending on your budget, you can either use a window as a front light or buy a diva ring light.</p><p><strong>Using a Window:</strong>  Face the window while you vlog and be careful that the camera’s shadow is not visible in your shot. Avoid using a window the sun is shining directly into. You want softer, more diffused, light for a beauty vlog.</p><p><strong>Using a Ring Light:</strong>  Mount your camera either inside the ring or right behind it on a tripod. Ring lights are powerful options for illuminating your entire face, and they are very popular with makeup vloggers.</p><p>Front lighting can make you appear flat against your background, so it is also a good idea to set up a backlight behind you to make you pop out. Setting up lights on either side of you can also help add dimension to your shot.</p><p>Check this tutorial to know more details:</p><h4 id="2-Organize-Your-Makeup"><a href="#2-Organize-Your-Makeup" class="headerlink" title="2. Organize Your Makeup"></a>2. Organize Your Makeup</h4><p>Having to search for makeup or reach across to where you are storing your curling iron will kill your vlogging momentum. Creating a great look is the fun part of beauty vlogging, and probably the part you want to focus on. Not looking for your missing brush. The best way to set yourself up for a beauty vlog is at a desk or table where you can lay everything out neatly right in front of you.</p><h4 id="3-Alter-Your-Background"><a href="#3-Alter-Your-Background" class="headerlink" title="3. Alter Your Background"></a>3. Alter Your Background</h4><p>Making your vlog look more professional can be as easy as dressing up your background. You do not want there to be a lot of clutter behind you, but you don’t want to shoot with your back to a plain beige wall either. One simple way to keep your background beautiful, but not distracting, is to use a backdrop. Just hang a sheet or other piece of fabric behind you. You can even use patterns and change your backdrop to match your makeup in different videos.</p><p>Another great way to disguise the room you are vlogging in, and make sure nothing behind you distracts your viewers, is to blur your background. You really stand out when your background is blurry and you are in perfect focus.</p><h4 id="4-Be-Audible"><a href="#4-Be-Audible" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Audible"></a>4. Be Audible</h4><p>You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you. Most cameras do not have great microphones, so you will need to use an external mic. To see what kinds of options you have make sure to read and watch “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Microphone for YouTube - Top 5 Mics for YouTube Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”.</p><p>If you do not have access to an external mic then you may be able to get by without one for a while using software. Make sure there is no background noise competing with your voice, and download a free audio editing program called Audacity from Audacityteam.org. Using Audacity you will be able to improve a mediocre audio recording from your camera and make it usable. This is a popular option among YouTube gamers who record both video and audio from their webcams, but there is no reason it should not be useful for beauty gurus too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Beauty Vlogs are some of the most popular channels on YouTube.

What’s the ideal YouTube thumbnail Size and Dimension?</strong></h2><p>An essential thing that every YouTube video developer needs to know is about the selection of the right side of the thumbnail for any video. As per the guidelines circulated by Google itself, the most appropriate size for the thumbnail image is 1280x720 pixels, where the recommended minimal pixel width is 640 pixels. Generally, the 16:9 ratio is considered as an ideal choice for Most of YouTube previews and players.</p><p>Here is one interesting thing that you need to know; the thumbnail of videos appears smaller during searches, but it naturally grows to the full size of a video during suggestions. Now the fact is that upscaling of images often loses the quality of content, whereas it is much easier to downscale larger images into smaller ones. Hence, the best idea is to use large size images so that this search and suggestion based scaling needs can be well accomplished.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 12 Best Free YouTube Thumbnail Makers &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > How to Download YouTube Thumbnail in 3 Ways [Online&#x2F;Win&#x2F;Mac] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Tips-for-Perfect-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2.

The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p><h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p><p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p><p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p><p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p><p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p><p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p><p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p><p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p><h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p><p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p><p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p><p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p><h4 id="3-Put-It-Together"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p><p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p><p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p><ol><li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li><li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li><li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li><li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li></ol><p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p><p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p><p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p><h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it). Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p><p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p><p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p><p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p><p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p><p>Click to check more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p><h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p><p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p><p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p><p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p><h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p><p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p><h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p><p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p><p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser.

It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p><p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background.

Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p><p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content.

Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p><p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p><p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background-1"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="#2.

Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p><p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p><p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p><p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p><p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p><p>Click to check more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p><h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-1"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-1" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p><p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-1"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-1" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face-1"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face-1" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p><p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p><p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics-1"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics-1" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p><h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-1"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-1" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p><p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p><h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition-1"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition-1" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p><p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p><p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser.

The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p><h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo-2"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo-2" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p><p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p><p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p><p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p><p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-2"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-2" class="headerlink" title="#2.

Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p><p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p><p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily.

Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p><p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used.

Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p><h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face-2"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face-2" class="headerlink" title="#3.

Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p><h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-2"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-2" class="headerlink" title="#5.

Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p><p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p><h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition-2"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition-2" class="headerlink" title="#6.

These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p><p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout.

You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p><p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-youtube-thumbnail-layout.jpg"                      alt="Popular YouTube Thumbnail Layout"                ></p><h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-3"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-3" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p><h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo-3"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p><p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p><p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p><p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p><p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-3"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p><p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p><p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p><p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p><h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-3"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p><p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-3"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p><p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p><p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background-3"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p><h4 id="3-Put-It-Together-3"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together-3" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p><p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p><h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-3"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-3" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p><p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p><ol><li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li><li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li><li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li><li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li></ol><p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p><p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p><p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p><h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-3"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it).

As a content creator, you go toiling several processes to ensure its success. More so, you are probably building a brand and want people to know about your product or services. What about one easy way to remember the URL and share it with your potential subscribers? Besides sending such links to people, you’ll be reminding them to subscribe with just a click. And that’s YouTube auto-subscribe link. It is a more effective way than asking or directing to check your YouTube channel. They’ll probably not find it easy, maneuvering around numbers of other channels that bear names close to your channel. A visitor will quickly give up. You can save them the crap and engage more effectively.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/create-youtube-subscribe-link-1.png"                      alt="youtube auto subscribe link"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How to subscribe to a YouTube channel?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to create an auto-subscribe link for your YouTube channel?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Other tricks that work besides YouTube auto-subscribe.</a></p><h2 id="How-to-subscribe-to-a-YouTube-channel"><a href="#How-to-subscribe-to-a-YouTube-channel" class="headerlink" title="How to subscribe to a YouTube channel?"></a>How to subscribe to a YouTube channel?</h2><p>A YouTube auto-subscribe link will be beneficial in many ways.

In this case, they may automatically subscribe you to their new channel. In most cases, such content creators want to promote their new channel.</p><p>• Check your extensions<br>One of your browsers may be playing tricks on your YouTube account. Extensions may change your browser’s settings and make the “Unsubscribe” option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.</p><p>• Someone else can hit the button<br>Do you share your computer with other fellows?

However, some reasons may contribute to that. You may have realized that YouTube just subscribed you to random channels without asking you. Here are the possible reasons for that.</p><p>• Spinoff Channel<br>A content creator may decide to come up with a Spinoff channel. In this case, they may automatically subscribe you to their new channel. In most cases, such content creators want to promote their new channel.</p><p>• Check your extensions<br>One of your browsers may be playing tricks on your YouTube account. Extensions may change your browser’s settings and make the “Unsubscribe” option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.</p><p>• Someone else can hit the button<br>Do you share your computer with other fellows? The chances are that someone hit the “Subscribe” button without your consent.

Can’t come up with one? Let me help. I heard you can make a mean scrambled egg, why don’t you show the world how you do it?</p><p>Excellent! Let’s go with that idea.</p><p>Wait, don’t go making the video yet. First, we have to do some research. We need to know what videos already exist out there.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Find-Related-Videos"><a href="#Step-1-Find-Related-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Find Related Videos"></a>Step 1: Find Related Videos</h4><p>Do a quick search on YouTube to see what videos already exist on your topic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-related-videos.jpg"                      alt="Find Related Videos Sample"                ></p><p>Uh oh… your video will be competing against celebrities like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver.</p><p>Okay, don’t panic!

You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p><p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p><p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p><p>- To be entertained</p><p>- To learn something new</p><p>- To be inspired</p><p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p><p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p><p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p><p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"                ></p><p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p><p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt=" Keywords in Ubersuggest"                ></p><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p><p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p><p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p><p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p><p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p><p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p><h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p><p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p><p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p><p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p><p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p><p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p><p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p><p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p><p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p><p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p><p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p><h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p><p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p><p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p><p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p><p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p><p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p><p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p><p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p><p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p><p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p><p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p><p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p><p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p><p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p><p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/encourage-viewers-to-engage-min.gif"                      alt="Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"                ></p><p>Who knows, who will respond.</p><h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p><p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"                ></p><p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different.

Can’t come up with one? Let me help. I heard you can make a mean scrambled egg, why don’t you show the world how you do it?</p><p>Excellent! Let’s go with that idea.</p><p>Wait, don’t go making the video yet. First, we have to do some research. We need to know what videos already exist out there.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Find-Related-Videos-1"><a href="#Step-1-Find-Related-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Find Related Videos"></a>Step 1: Find Related Videos</h4><p>Do a quick search on YouTube to see what videos already exist on your topic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-related-videos.jpg"                      alt="Find Related Videos Sample"                ></p><p>Uh oh… your video will be competing against celebrities like Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver.</p><p>Okay, don’t panic!

You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p><p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p><p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p><p>- To be entertained</p><p>- To learn something new</p><p>- To be inspired</p><p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p><p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords-1"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p><p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p><p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"                ></p><p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p><p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt=" Keywords in Ubersuggest"                ></p><h4 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-1"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p><p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p><p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p><p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p><p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p><p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p><h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title-1"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p><p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p><p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p><p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p><p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p><p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p><p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p><p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p><p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p><p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p><p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p><h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description-1"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p><p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p><p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags-1"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p><p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p><p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p><p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p><p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p><p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-1"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p><p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-1"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll-1"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p><p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p><p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p><p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-1"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p><p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p><p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p><p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/encourage-viewers-to-engage-min.gif"                      alt="Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"                ></p><p>Who knows, who will respond.</p><h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail-1"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p><p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"                ></p><p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p><p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p><p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful.

You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p><p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p><p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p><p>- To be entertained</p><p>- To learn something new</p><p>- To be inspired</p><p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p><p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords-2"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p><p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p><p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"                ></p><p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p><p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt=" Keywords in Ubersuggest"                ></p><h4 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-2"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p><p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p><p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p><p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p><p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p><p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p><h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title-2"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p><p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p><p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p><p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p><p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p><p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p><p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p><p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p><p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p><p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p><p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p><h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description-2"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p><p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p><p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags-2"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p><p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p><p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p><p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p><p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p><p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-2"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p><p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-2"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll-2"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p><p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p><p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p><p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-2"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p><p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p><p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p><p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/encourage-viewers-to-engage-min.gif"                      alt="Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"                ></p><p>Who knows, who will respond.</p><h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail-2"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p><p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"                ></p><p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p><p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p><p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful.

This step is easy, upload the video, and fill out the assets, and give yourself a pat on the back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creator-stuido-fill-out-video-assets.jpg"                      alt="Fill Out Your Videos Assets"                ></p><h4 id="Step-11-Add-Transcripts-2"><a href="#Step-11-Add-Transcripts-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 11: Add Transcripts"></a>Step 11: Add Transcripts</h4><p>In addition to making your content accessible for people who don’t want to or can’t listen to the audio in your video, adding subtitles and closed captions will help YouTube understand the spoken content in your video.</p><p>While YouTube does have an automatic subtitle generator, it’s not reliable enough to be used for identifying the keywords you use in your video.</p><p>You can choose to write out the whole transcript of your video yourself, but if you are press on time, which of course you are, you can simply go and edit the automatic transcript already available in your video. By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist-2"><a href="#Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 12: Add Video to Playlist"></a>Step 12: Add Video to Playlist</h4><p>Finally the last thing you need to do for your video is to add it to a playlist. Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist. As you accumulate more content, having videos in playlists makes content easier to find and keeps relevant videos together.</p><p>When viewers searches, having your videos in playlists increases the chance of it being discovered.</p><p>So if your first video is about scrambled eggs, maybe you next video can be about the awesome butter toasts.</p><p>I guess, you are on your way to making a pretty badass breakfast playlist. I personally can’t wait to see it!</p><p>If you treat SEO as an afterthought, only after your video is created, you are not using it to its full potential. If you follow these 12 steps during the course of your production, you will find that SEO doesn’t simply help your video perform at the end, but contributes in all the other phases of creating your video as well.</p><p>Besides considering YouTube SEO, you should make a good YouTube video as well.

Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p><p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p><p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"                ></p><p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p><p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt=" Keywords in Ubersuggest"                ></p><h4 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-3"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p><p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p><p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p><p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p><p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p><p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p><h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title-3"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p><p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p><p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p><p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p><p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p><p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p><p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p><p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p><p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p><p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p><p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p><h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description-3"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p><p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p><p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags-3"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p><p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p><p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p><p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p><p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p><p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-3"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p><p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-3"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll-3"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p><p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p><p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p><p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-3"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p><p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p><p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p><p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/encourage-viewers-to-engage-min.gif"                      alt="Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"                ></p><p>Who knows, who will respond.</p><h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail-3"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p><p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"                ></p><p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p><p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p><p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful. These will help you get the job done as you are starting out.</p><p>Want to know more thumbnail maker? Check our picks of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Publishing-With-Attention-to-Optimization-3"><a href="#Part-3-Publishing-With-Attention-to-Optimization-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Publishing With Attention to Optimization"></a>Part 3: Publishing With Attention to Optimization</h2><p>Well done finishing the video! You are almost there… but not there yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.filmora.io/5/XDyocwuGRiSptxueJZ5aokKqKt-JXMbX.gif"                      alt="XDyocwuGRiSptxueJZ5aokKqKt-JXMbX"                ></p><p>Come on, keep going!</p><h4 id="Step-10-Fill-Out-Your-Videos-Assets-3"><a href="#Step-10-Fill-Out-Your-Videos-Assets-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 10: Fill Out Your Videos Assets"></a>Step 10: Fill Out Your Videos Assets</h4><p>The video is done, the thumbnail is designed, and you have all your title, description, and tags ready to go. This step is easy, upload the video, and fill out the assets, and give yourself a pat on the back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creator-stuido-fill-out-video-assets.jpg"                      alt="Fill Out Your Videos Assets"                ></p><h4 id="Step-11-Add-Transcripts-3"><a href="#Step-11-Add-Transcripts-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 11: Add Transcripts"></a>Step 11: Add Transcripts</h4><p>In addition to making your content accessible for people who don’t want to or can’t listen to the audio in your video, adding subtitles and closed captions will help YouTube understand the spoken content in your video.</p><p>While YouTube does have an automatic subtitle generator, it’s not reliable enough to be used for identifying the keywords you use in your video.</p><p>You can choose to write out the whole transcript of your video yourself, but if you are press on time, which of course you are, you can simply go and edit the automatic transcript already available in your video. By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist-3"><a href="#Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 12: Add Video to Playlist"></a>Step 12: Add Video to Playlist</h4><p>Finally the last thing you need to do for your video is to add it to a playlist. Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist. As you accumulate more content, having videos in playlists makes content easier to find and keeps relevant videos together.</p><p>When viewers searches, having your videos in playlists increases the chance of it being discovered.</p><p>So if your first video is about scrambled eggs, maybe you next video can be about the awesome butter toasts.</p><p>I guess, you are on your way to making a pretty badass breakfast playlist. I personally can’t wait to see it!</p><p>If you treat SEO as an afterthought, only after your video is created, you are not using it to its full potential. If you follow these 12 steps during the course of your production, you will find that SEO doesn’t simply help your video perform at the end, but contributes in all the other phases of creating your video as well.</p><p>Besides considering YouTube SEO, you should make a good YouTube video as well.

However, some reasons may contribute to that. You may have realized that YouTube just subscribed you to random channels without asking you. Here are the possible reasons for that.</p><p>• Spinoff Channel<br>A content creator may decide to come up with a Spinoff channel. In this case, they may automatically subscribe you to their new channel. In most cases, such content creators want to promote their new channel.</p><p>• Check your extensions<br>One of your browsers may be playing tricks on your YouTube account. Extensions may change your browser’s settings and make the “Unsubscribe” option unavailable. Try disabling all of your browser extensions, then check back if YouTube still subscribes you to channels unknown to you. If so, solve the issue by uninstalling the specific extensions. These could be ad blockers or free VPN extensions.</p><p>• Someone else can hit the button<br>Do you share your computer with other fellows? The chances are that someone hit the “Subscribe” button without your consent. Just unsubscribe and keep watching next time.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● The internet arena is very competitive.

It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p><p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p><ol><li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li><li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li></ol><p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p><p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/average-view-duration.jpg"                      alt="average-view-duration"                >  </p><h4 id="See-Audience-Retention-of-Individual-Videos"><a href="#See-Audience-Retention-of-Individual-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See Audience Retention of Individual Videos"></a><strong>See Audience Retention of Individual Videos</strong></h4><p><strong>Absolute Audience Retention:</strong> This report shows you the number of views at every point in the video as a percentage.

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/how-to-use-audience-retention.jpg"                      alt="how-to-use-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p><p><strong>7.

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/how-to-use-audience-retention.jpg"                      alt="how-to-use-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p><p><strong>7.

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/how-to-use-audience-retention.jpg"                      alt="how-to-use-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p><p><strong>7.

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p><p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p><p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/how-to-use-audience-retention.jpg"                      alt="how-to-use-audience-retention"                ></p><p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p><p><strong>7.

Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow.

You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p><p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop).

The categories are more related to moods than genres and include things like ‘cute’, ‘sneaky’, and ‘reflective’. Because they know you may want to use this music in film projects, you can even find categories like ‘dark backgrounds’.</p><p>Once you click into a category everything is listed, you can’t narrow your results. There’s not an overwhelming number of songs in each category, though, so it’s easy to choose something just by reading descriptions and listening to what’s there.</p><h4 id="15-Sounds-Crate-3"><a href="#15-Sounds-Crate-3" class="headerlink" title="15.

After you click into music, you’ll see thumbnails for sections related to a number of themes such as action music, corporate music, and hip hop. You’ll be able to preview and download all the songs in the category once you’re on the category page.</p><p>You are only allowed 5 downloads per day while you’re using Sounds Crate for free. They also request a $10 annual donation from free users, but it’s optional.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

YouTube is a powerful channel to promote your video and get more traffic.</p><p>The most common question is how much YouTubers earn on 100, 1000, or 10,000 views. We’re going to answer that question in this article and explain how to calculate YouTube views to money.</p><p>First off, we’re going to talk about how YouTube works.</p><p>Next, we’ll examine the importance of YouTube views, plus how to calculate them.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">YouTube Money Calculator</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Aux mode</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Tunepocket</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Estimated your YouTube earning by YouTube revenue reports</a></li><li><a href="#part4">How much money can you make on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Bonus tip: Increase YouTube earnings with a powerful video editing software</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-The-rules-to-know-for-each-means-earning-money-from-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-The-rules-to-know-for-each-means-earning-money-from-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The rules to know for each means earning money from YouTube"></a>Part 1: The rules to know for each means earning money from YouTube</h2><p>As a YouTube creator, finding ways to earn money from your content cannot be easy. Some creators make a living solely off their channels. Others supplement their income with affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and ad revenue. But if you want to earn money from YouTube truly, you need to understand which monetization methods work best for you and your content.</p><p>Here’s what you should know when using each method and why you should consider doing so:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Methods</strong></th><th><strong>Viewers&#x2F;Clicks&#x2F;Impressions</strong></th><th><strong>Earnings&#x2F;Commission</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>YouTube Ads $1 CPM</strong></td><td>1 million Ad views</td><td>Average rate per ad&#x3D;0.18Total ~ $5000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brand Sponsorships</strong></td><td>5K Sub 5K-30K Sub 30K-500K Sub 500K-1M+ Sub</td><td>$300 $700 $950 $3500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Affiliate Marketing 30%-35% commission</strong></td><td>If 100 people buys $20 product through affiliate link. Total $2000</td><td>$2000*35%&#x3D; $700</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Crowdfunding (Patreon, Indiegogo, GoFundMe) $5</strong></td><td>100 subscribers funds the channel</td><td>100*5&#x3D;$500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Merchandise Shelf $5 Shirt</strong></td><td>100 subscribers purchases your merch</td><td>100*5&#x3D;$500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Channel Memberships $5&#x2F;month</strong></td><td>100 loyal subscribers join membership</td><td>100*5&#x3D;$500</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="YouTube-Ads"><a href="#YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Ads"></a>YouTube Ads</h3><p>The video ads on the platform aren’t lucrative and can be used to supplement your income in the form of AdSense earnings. An actual advertiser pays 0.18 per ad view on average (as shown above). That means 1000 ad views equals $18 and $3-$5 per 1000 views.</p><h3 id="Brand-Sponsorships"><a href="#Brand-Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="Brand Sponsorships"></a>Brand Sponsorships</h3><p>Brands can sponsor your videos to reach their target audience. YouTube videos are a big part of our lives, and brands are becoming increasingly aware of how useful these videos can be. To be eligible for sponsorship, your channel must be of 5000 subscribers.</p><h3 id="Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Marketing"></a>Affiliate Marketing</h3><p>YouTubers help brands increase sales by encouraging their viewers to shop at the company’s store or visit its specific product pages. They then earn a commission (30%-35%) on products that people buy after clicking an affiliate link.</p><h3 id="Crowdfunding"><a href="#Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="Crowdfunding"></a>Crowdfunding</h3><p>Today many people use crowdfunding websites to raise money for personal, channel-related projects. Most YouTubers are doing it to generate steady cash flow. Some of them use this source to fund their YouTube videos so that it increases quality and engagement.</p><h3 id="Merchandise-Shelf"><a href="#Merchandise-Shelf" class="headerlink" title="Merchandise Shelf"></a>Merchandise Shelf</h3><p>Your merchandise represents and feeds your audience’s connection with you. Your product is your business, so you’re first and foremost an entrepreneur. Then design your YouTube marketing strategy to sell your merchandise and generate income.</p><h3 id="Channel-Membership"><a href="#Channel-Membership" class="headerlink" title="Channel Membership"></a>Channel Membership</h3><p>YouTube has a plan that allows you to charge your subscribers for membership on your YouTube channel.

Ensure you peruse through the various categories and find one that speaks to you and fits the kind of content you create.</p><p>Below is a step-by-step guide on how to edit YouTube thumbnail text fonts.</p><p>Step1 Launch Wondershare Filmora on your device and select “New Project.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-01.png"                      alt="filmora new project"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the icon shown below to import media from your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-03.png"                      alt="filmora import media"                ></p><p>Step3 Drag and drop your photos as shown below to create your YouTube Thumbnail on the platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-add-media-to-timeline.jpg"                      alt="filmora add media to timeline"                ></p><p>Step4 Add titles to customize the texts in your Thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-add-titles.jpg"                      alt="filmora add titles"                ></p><p>Step5 In the Titles panel, you can customize the font.

Right click the snapshot, and select “Reveal in Explorer” to locate it in your local drive. Then you can use it as your YouTube Thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-reveal-in-explorer.jpg"                      alt="filmora reveal in explorer"                ></p><p>You don’t need to search for fonts on the Internet when Wondershare Filmora offers downloadable fonts. If you are interested in installing fonts in Filmora, watch this video to learn how.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you generate thumbnails for your YouTube videos, it would be wise to ensure you make them full-sized. The ideal dimension for a YouTube thumbnail should be 1280*720. Since most of your viewers use their mobile phones to watch YouTube videos, it would help to ensure the thumbnail looks the same on your laptop and your mobile device.</p><p>A hazy or pixelated thumbnail could discourage the viewer from clicking on your video. We hope you have found a font you like and will incorporate it into your next YouTube video.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"
