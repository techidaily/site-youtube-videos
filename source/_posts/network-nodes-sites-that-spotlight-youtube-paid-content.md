Famebit is the most popular influencer marketing platform, but there are lots of sites like Famebit where YouTube creators can find sponsorships. The key is to find one where you won't be reduced to a database entry listing your channel’s genre and your subscriber count.

If you want to be valued for your talent then FameBit is a great choice, but it’s not your only choice. If you are serious about finding sponsorships and creating branded content then there is no reason you shouldn’t be on multiple platforms.

2. [**TapInfluence**](#tapin)
3. [**Izea**](#izea)
4. [**ReadyPulse**](#readypulse)

## 4 Alternatives to FameBit

Here are four influencer marketing platforms besides FameBit that cater to creators, not just brands.

#### **Revfluence**  

[Revfluence](http://www.revfluence.com/) promises creators they will be able to ‘create content on their terms’. They work with both YouTubers and Instagrammers.

A lot of big fashion brands like Calvin Klein, Madewell, and Gap can be found on Revfluence. This platform is a must if you have a lifestyle, beauty, or fashion channel.

On Revfluence you can browse through brands instead of waiting for them to contact you. You choose which companies you want to endorse, so you never have to worry about losing your integrity in the eyes of your subscribers. Once you find a sponsor, you maintain control over how you choose to collaborate with them.

**![Alternatives to FameBit - Tapinfluence](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-tapinfluence.jpg)**

#### **TapInfluence**

[TapInfluence](http://www.tapinfluence.com/) might initially seem more brand-focused than equal, like FameBit, because it makes you wait for brands to select you. You are not simply on-call for any brand willing to pay, though.

After a brand approaches you, you get to examine their offer and decide whether you would feel proud to be associated with them.

The main thing that sets TapInfluence apart from other platforms where brands approach you is their attitude towards influencers and the way they define influence.

Some creators get turned off by the word ‘influencer’, and it is easy to understand why. Your subscriber count is important when you want to participate in an ad campaign, but your subscribers are not just numbers and you are not some kind of puppetmaster ‘influencing’ them for monetary gain.

TapInfluence values authenticity and works with brands that hold that same value. Your ability to be genuine with your audience is never compromised because it is that honest relationship that makes you valuable to brands.

**![Alternatives to FameBit - Izea](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-izea.jpg)**

#### **Izea**

[Izea’s](https://izea.com/) motto states that they champion the creators. They value you for whatever it is you already do, be it ranting vlogs or educational content.

When you create your profile on Izea you connect your YouTube account, and any other social media account you open to use for branded content. You also describe your audience and state your asking price.

Brands distribute their sponsorship opportunities to select groups of creators based on what they are looking for. Sponsors may approach you, or you can take matters into your own hands and approach brands with creative pitches.

**![Alternatives to FameBit - ReadyPulse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-to-famebit-readypulse.jpg)**

#### **ReadyPulse**

[ReadyPulse](http://www.readypulse.com/) is different from both FameBit and the other platforms on this list because you do not join brands for specific campaigns, you become a brand ambassador.

The idea is that you continue being you – creating the same style of content you already do – but you also have a relationship with a brand that you openly support and advocate for. The trust your subscribers have in you is supposed to be extended to your associated brands.

This is excellent if you have the opportunity to become a brand ambassador for a company you respect and are excited to work with. You can get all kinds of perks – like discounts and early releases – from your partner brand, and there is no reason you should not want your subscribers to trust the brand that you trust.

It becomes problematic if you find yourself matched with brands you do not have total confidence in, although ReadyPulse does try to match brands with influencers who are already fans of them.

Only you can decide if becoming a brand ambassador is right for you and your audience.

 Do you know about any other sites like Famebit?

## Top 5 Cozy Winter Scenes for YouTube Backdrops

There’s something special about wintertime that makes us all want to get as cozy and as warm as possible. When you’re a YouTube creator, you should definitely take advantage of this desire and use a YouTube background video designed specifically with this in mind.

In this guide, we’ll go over how to get or make such a background and show you five incredible examples you can use now.

**YouTube Video Background** Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.

[Create Video Backgrounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Create Video Backgrounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Learn Green Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![Wondershare Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png)

## What Is a YouTube Video Background?

A **YouTube video background** is a simple image or video that sits in place at the back of your videos. It’s just a simple background that can greatly impact your brand, presence, and style as a creator.

Even something as small as your **YouTube video thumbnail background** can strongly impact your results.

Obviously, choosing the right **custom YouTube background** is important. And, now that it’s winter, this requires a special approach.

## Why Are Seasonal Backgrounds Effective?

There are several important reasons why a seasonal YouTube video background or photo, and other elements are very effective and engage us more.

The main reasons include:

* Creates a meaningful connection;
* Boosts engagement with fellow winter lovers;
* Builds a better brand;
* Enhances everyone’s mood, especially during the holidays.

So, whenever you can and whenever there is an opportunity, don’t be afraid to use a seasonal **YouTube video background download**.

## Factors to Consider When Choosing a Background for YouTube Videos

Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.

### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

### Editing

If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a **green screen background for YouTube videos**.

## **5 Winter YouTube Background Ideas**

It’s finally time to have a look at some examples of highly effective and engaging YouTube video backgrounds for the winter season.

Enjoy!

## How to Create or Source Winter Backgrounds

If you want to make your own winter backgrounds or simply edit the ones you have, the most effective way is to use a beginner-friendly video editing platform, such as [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

This type of platform has all the necessary tools, templates, and presets for professionals to use but all of it is packed in a very easy-to-use interface that anyone can get the hang of.

Just follow these steps and you’ll have the perfect winter **background for YouTube** in no time.

##### Step 4

Select your favorite background clip and drag it down to the Timeline.

That’s it! You won’t believe how many video clips you can use, all of which are extremely high-quality. As a result, you’ll have a professional video for free.

Now, if you want, you can freely edit these backgrounds as you wish. You can mess around with them as much as you want, use various tools to edit, and make the perfect result.

And don’t worry, if you mess up the background and don’t know how to restore it, just delete it from the timeline and drag it again from the Stock Media tab. It will be as good as new.

Once you’re done, simply export it and you’re done.

## Integrating Your Background Into Videos

Finally, once you have the perfect YouTube studio background, it’s time to glue it to your video and upload this masterpiece.

In order to do this, you will need to use a video editing platform once again. This is not optional as there is no other way to merge these clips.

Luckily, you now have Filmora downloaded and can easily make it happen.

So, here’s how to combine everything.

##### Step 1

Start up a New Project in Filmora.

##### Step 2

Click on **“**My Media” and then click in the middle of the small box to upload your background and your video clips.

![upload media in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/winter-youtube-background-ideas-to-warm-up-your-videos-8.png)

##### Step 3

After uploading all the files, simply drag everything in a separate Track down on the Timeline.

##### Step 4

Export and upload to YouTube. That’s it!

## Summary

You’re now ready to make some outstanding Winter YouTube videos and bless everyone with amazing scenery and backgrounds that will make their hearts warm up. Not only do you have infinite backgrounds to choose from, you also know how to perfectly blend them in any of your videos.

Now, before we dive into the examples themselves and the tutorial on how to make the best backgrounds yourself, here are several factors you must consider before proceeding.

### Content Relevance

As a video creator, you must ensure to be consistent with your elements. This includes your **background tune for YouTube videos.** For example, if you’re talking about books in your video, including a bookshelf in the winter background makes all the difference.

### Audience Appeal

If you already have an audience, regardless of its size, you should definitely consider what they like and don’t like. You should then leverage this information to create highly appealing content for them and adjust your background scenery accordingly.

### Lighting and Visibility

Another thing you must ensure is to keep your background simple and not too distracting. Remember, even though you have the **best background for YouTube videos**, you still need to realize that it’s not the main focus of the video. It’s just there to make it better.

### Personal Branding

If you want to improve your brand identity and get your name known by more people, incorporate your logo, name, or something similar in the background. It will have a small but meaningful impact, and it’s easy to do.

### Editing

If you plan to shoot a YouTube live background and not some stock images or videos, then you must make sure it has enough headroom for editing later on. The best option here is to use a **green screen background for YouTube videos**.

This type of platform has all the necessary tools, templates, and presets for professionals to use but all of it is packed in a very easy-to-use interface that anyone can get the hang of.

Just follow these steps and you’ll have the perfect winter **background for YouTube** in no time.

##### Step 4

Select your favorite background clip and drag it down to the Timeline.

That’s it! You won’t believe how many video clips you can use, all of which are extremely high-quality. As a result, you’ll have a professional video for free.

Now, if you want, you can freely edit these backgrounds as you wish. You can mess around with them as much as you want, use various tools to edit, and make the perfect result.

And don’t worry, if you mess up the background and don’t know how to restore it, just delete it from the timeline and drag it again from the Stock Media tab. It will be as good as new.

Once you’re done, simply export it and you’re done.

## Integrating Your Background Into Videos

Finally, once you have the perfect YouTube studio background, it’s time to glue it to your video and upload this masterpiece.

In order to do this, you will need to use a video editing platform once again. This is not optional as there is no other way to merge these clips.

Luckily, you now have Filmora downloaded and can easily make it happen.

So, here’s how to combine everything.

##### Step 1

Start up a New Project in Filmora.

##### Step 2

Click on **“**My Media” and then click in the middle of the small box to upload your background and your video clips.

##### Step 3

##### Step 4

Export and upload to YouTube. That’s it!
