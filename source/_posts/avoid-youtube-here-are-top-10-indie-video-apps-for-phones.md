## 5 Best YouTube App Alternatives for Android Phone

We will not be leaving our Android phone readers behind. For the best YouTube App for their gadgets, here are our top picks for this year.

### 1\. [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/)

**Price:** Free

This Freeware, open-source app is basically a lighter version of the YouTube app that doesn't require any Google Play services to run smoothly. NewPipe collects the URL source from YouTube and displays the information it gathers in the app that is completely independent of this platform. The app's users can search videos, view the video's info, or choose which streaming player they are going to use to watch the video. The app offers support for videos in 1080p, 2K, or 4K resolution, which means that you watch high-quality videos from your phone. The NewPipe app is a great choice for YouTubers who don't have powerful Android phones but still want to enjoy the benefits of browsing the world's largest video-sharing platform.

**NewPipe Features**

* Runs without Google Play Services
* Unlimited downloads
* You can set and change the quality of video play
* Play videos in the background while you use other apps
* Download the video and audio at different resolutions.
* Play video as a Pop-up box for multitasking
* Lightweight and consumes low storage and battery

[Download New Pipe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/)

![NewPipe YouTube Alternative ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/NewPipe-youtube-alternative-android.jpg)

##### Pros

Great browsing and search features

Lets you download videos to your device

Offers support for high-resolution videos

##### Cons

The app is not available on the Google Play store

Limited tools for creating playlists

### 2\. [OGYouTube](https://ogyoutube.en.uptodown.com/android)

**Price:** Free

Like most YouTube client apps, OGYouTube lets you browse the platform, listen to music or watch videos in different resolutions. As a matter of fact, this app is just an older version of the YouTube client app, that still provides the option to download videos. However, if you log into your account on YouTube, with the OGYouTube app you won't be able to download videos. The app's interface is identical to YouTube's interface, which means that you won't have to waste a lot of time trying to figure out how to use OGYouTube.

**OGYouTube Features**

* Play and download videos directly from the app
* Supports different video qualities
* Play video in background
* Comes with a dark mode on android devices

##### Pros

A great option for people who don't have powerful Android phones

Lets you play videos while using other apps

The app doesn't contain ads

##### Cons

Not an official YouTube client app

Not available on Google Play Store

### 3\. [YouTube GO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.mango&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

YouTube's official app can be quite demanding since it requires a fast Internet connection. That's the reason why the company launched a lighter version of their official app, which is currently available in 130 countries around the world. One of the greatest advantages of the YouTube Go app is the fact that it lets you choose how many MB you spend on videos. Furthermore, the app is built to work seamlessly even at low Internet speeds, so its users can listen to music or download videos even if they don't have access to an ultra-fast WiFi connection.

**YouTube Go Features**

* Official YouTube app for rapid downloads and sharing
* Download the app directly from Google Play Store
* You can preview videos before watching
* Download videos to your device and watch offline
* You can watch videos in different qualities
* Lets you control data speed

##### Pros

Video transfers don't use data

Remarkable video sharing capabilities

Compatible with older versions of Android OS

##### Cons

Users can't create playlists

The app contains ads

### 4\. [FlyTube APK](https://flytube.en.uptodown.com/android)

YouTube Creator Summit has been held for several years. In 2019, it was held in Tokyo, Japan, but back in 2016, 2017 and 2018, it was held in New York City. This article just introduced the YouTube Creator Summit in 2017.

Tons of big-name creators were flown out by YouTube for a week of activities, networking opportunities, interesting speakers, and unicorn petting zoos. We assume.

* [**A map of Dumbo**](#dumbo)
* [**Post Cards**](#postcards)
* [**S’well bottle**](#bottle)
* [**Branded slippers**](#slippers)
* [**Pins, pins, pins**](#pins)
* [**Denim jacket**](#jacket)

_Lilly’s Creator Summit adventures._

The Creator Summit is invite-only, and only 120 YouTubers attended including Grace Helbig, Lilly Singh, Matthew Santoro, Eva Gutowski, Jon Cozart, and Hannah Hart. We can really only imagine what went on based on what some YouTubers chose to share with us over social media. That’s how we know there were appearances from off-YouTube celebrities too, like Will Smith and Riz Ahmed.

![YouTube Creator Summit Group Photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-2017.jpg)

_Will Smith was one of the speakers at the summit. Turns out_ [_he’s a big fan of Lilly Singh_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGlcsogbAQY)_._

Thanks to Nick from nickatnyte, for example, we have a pretty clear picture of the kinds of swag YouTube was giving away.

_Nick talks about arriving in New York and goes through the swag box waiting in his hotel room._

There were some clues as to what the rest of the summit was like hiding amongst the swag too. Here’s what was in the box:

## 1\. A map of Dumbo

The hotel YouTube put the creators up in was in Dumbo, Brooklyn. ‘Dumbo’ is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. While it used to be primarily an industrial area, Dumbo is now the most expensive neighborhood in Brooklyn with many of the old industrial spaces now serving as luxury residential lofts. Dumbo is also a hub for tech startups.

_Tess takes you to some of her favorite places in Dumbo._

Dumbo is home to an interesting mix of ‘past’ and ‘future’. The creators who attended the summit probably had a lot of fun exploring it.

## 2\. Post Cards

One of the major benefits of attending this summit would have been networking with other creators, but because of how busy everyone was and how awkward it can be to arrange ‘bumping into’ someone YouTube created a way for creators to send each other notes. All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.

## 3\. S’well bottle

S’well bottles are stainless steel beverage containers that keep drinks hot or cold. They retail for around $45\. YouTubers invited to the Creator Summit received ones with YouTube branding on them. A good water bottle is a convention/conference essential, so this was a very practical gift.

## 4\. Branded slippers

To help them relax after long days at the summit, YouTube provided creators with YouTube-branded slippers. They look pretty comfy. Plus, now every time these YouTubers look down at their feet they’ll be reminded to go make some videos.

![Branded slippers - 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-branded-slippers.jpg)

_thinknoodles wearing his YouTube slippers._

## 5\. Pins, pins, pins

There were numerous custom pins available at different events at the summit. Aside from a complementary Brooklyn and 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (the hotel the creators were staying at) pins, the creators did not receive these in their swag boxes – they had to collect them.

## 6\. Denim jacket

A denim jacket with a play button on it was also in the box. The idea was that creators would collect pins and display them on their new jackets. At the end of the week, they would have a great souvenir reminding them of every event they attended at the summit.

_![Denim jacket- 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-denim-jacket.jpg)_

_Hannah Hart posted this photo from a river cruise she and other YouTubers went on while in New York for the summit._

Most creators here on Filmora are still trying to grow their channels, but one day I hope you’ll be able to attend an event like the YouTube Creator Summit and tell us all about it!

Want to join the YouTube Creator Summit in the future? We all know that there is a long way to go, but we can start making good YouTube videos now. Remember to use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with the templates and effects to touch up your YouTube videos.

Want to join the YouTube Creator Summit in the future? We all know that there is a long way to go, but we can start making good YouTube videos now. Remember to use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with the templates and effects to touch up your YouTube videos.
