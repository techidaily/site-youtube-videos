If you’re a musician who wants the world to hear your music, getting your music on YouTube is a must! By uploading your work onto the world’s most popular video platform, you talent has the potential to reach millions of listeners. Here are fifteen YouTube video ideas you can use to share your music.

## Polish Your YouTube Music Videos with Filmora

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) features plentiful video and audio editing tools, which allows you to cut out unwanted clips, [remove the background noise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), change the video and audio speed. The tutorial below shows you [how to create a split-screen video with fun](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with the split-screen presets in Filmora.

[![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora9 Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1. Live Performance

Raw talent that is unedited and uncut can make a huge impact on your audience. In the above video, William Singe and Alex Aiono perform a live mashup from beginning to end without stopping. This kind of all-in-one-take performance is even more impressive when it is flawless. If you’ve got what it takes to perform your music from beginning to end without stopping, try recording yourself doing a live performance.

#### 2. Cover A Classic Song

Although you might gain a lot of views in the short-run by covering a popular song that is currently in the top charts, you may find that your views will drop significantly in a few years when the song loses its relevance in pop culture. On the other hand, classic songs are timeless and performing them may even pleasantly evoke nostalgia to many listeners. In the video above, Daniela Andrade and HanByul Kang beautifully cover the 1934 jazz classic “Stars Fell on Alabama.” Do you have any favorite old classics?

#### 3. Cover a Popular Song With Your Own Lyrics

As mentioned above, covering a popular song that is currently in the top charts can bring in a lot of views. But since many people do just straight covers of songs, you’ll find yourself competing for views against many other musicians if you do the same. Creatively rewriting the lyrics of the song you choose to cover is one way you can set your cover apart from all the others out there. In the above video, the performer creatively sings a cover of MAGIC!’s “Rude” from the perspective of the father in the song.

#### 4. Cover a Popular Song In a Different Genre

Another way to set your cover apart from all the other many covers out there is to change up the genre. Whether or not everyone likes the genre you choose, it’s still undoubtedly interesting to hear a familiar song in such a different way. Postmodern Jukebox transforms a lot of current songs into old genres of music. Check out their jazzy version of Meghan Trainor’s “All About That Bass.”

#### 5. Show Your Musical Adaptability Through Many Genres

Professional musicians mostly adhere to fewer genres of music so that they don’t leave their listeners confused about who they are as a musician. This, at times, can get quite predictable and boring. Switching between multiple genres can be refreshingly interesting, especially if it’s many genres in one video. Rapper Mac Lethal explores 27 styles of rap in the above video.

#### 6. Cover a Popular Song With a Musical Instrument (Or With Several If You Know How To Play More Than One)

If you cover a popular song with a musical instrument, you not only have the potential to gain many views from people searching up your song, but you also have the potential to gain many views from people searching up your instrument. In the above video, Lily Liu performs “See You Again” on her Zither/Guzheng.

#### 7. Play Your Musical Instrument In a Unique Way

In much of the same way that performing a familiar song in a different genre can be refreshingly interesting, playing a familiar musical instrument in a different way can have the same effect. The above video is a YouTube classic video featuring Greg Pattillo playing his flute while simultaneously beatboxing.

#### 8. Cover a Popular Song Using Odd (Non-Musical) Objects

Since music is a combination of notes, you can practically create music out of anything that has a pitch, which is everything that makes a sound. With the power of editing and pitch manipulation, you can create fascinating instrumental covers like Andrew Huang’s 99 Red Balloons.

#### 9. Transform Non-Melodic Speech Into Music

There’s a lot you can do with music creation when you have access to software pitch manipulation. One of those things you can do is transform non-melodic speech into music. In the above video, many different clips of Donald Trump have been edited together to recreate Camila Cabello’s hit song “Havana.”

#### 10. Produce a Remix

Most of the ideas we mention in this list have to do with taking something already existing and transforming it into something new. Similarly, a remix is a transformative musical piece. But rather than performing your music in a different and interesting way, remixing involves producing digital music using music production software. In the above video, C2C remixes Stevie Wonder’s “Superstition.”

#### 11. Produce a Mashup

Unlike a medley where you perform one song and then move onto the next in a sequential manner, in a mashup you blend parts and fragments of songs together in a non-sequential manner, oftentimes overlapping parts that belong to different songs (vocals from one song over the instrumental of another song). In order to do this in a way that ends up not sounding like a jumbled mess, you need to make sure all the parts you’re mixing together are not only in the same tempo, but also in the same key. My mashups have been shared all over the world.

#### 12. Make An Acapella Arrangement

Most songs on the radio have all kinds of different sounds going on that it can be difficult to just appreciate and enjoy the sound of the human voice. Acapella arrangements, on the other hand, attempt to recreate music with just the voice. Your own voice is a musical instrument that you can use in so many different ways to make all kinds of unique sounds. Mike Tompkins is someone who has made his mark on YouTube as an acapella musician.

#### 13. Impersonate Celebrities

If you’re a musician who also happens to be good at doing impersonations of celebrities, recording yourself performing a song in different voices that others are familiar with can be a huge hit. In the above video, Yanina Chiesa performs a medley of songs featuring 15 different celebrity singers.

#### 14. Music Tutorial

YouTube is the go-to place for many people who want to learn how to do something, including music. In the above video, Anna-Maria Hefele explains how polyphonic overtone singing works.

#### 15. Make A Song So Bad, It Just Might Go Viral

Making music that’s so bad that it goes viral is not as easy as you might think. When it comes to bad quality material, there’s probably more of those on YouTube than there is good quality material. Your music will have to be extra bad in order to stand out among the competition. Rebecca Black's “Friday” is a notable example of this last YouTube video idea.

## Part 1: When does youtube pay you \[threshold to meet\]

As a YouTuber, do you feel like you're always struggling to reach some "threshold" where YouTube finally starts rewarding your efforts with some financial reward? You came to the right place; here's a list of Youtube minimum criteria to reach the threshold.

### 1\. 1K subscribers

The first requirement to monetize your channel is to increase your subscribers to at least 1000.

### 2\. Follow all the YouTube channel monetization policies

These policies are a collection of documents containing all the policies, guidelines, and terms that apply to the YouTube Partner Program and advertising programs.

### 3\. Availability in your region

It would be best if you were in the listed countries where Youtube Partner Program is available.

### 4\. Strike free channel

Remember to avoid any strikes if you are planning to monetize your channel.

### 5\. 4,000 watch hours

To qualify as a creator with a sustainable audience, you'll need at least 4,000 public watch hours within 12 months in your channel.

### 6\. AdSense account

You'll need to ensure that you have a Google Adsense account set up and ready to go. Without an Adsense account, the video isn't eligible to be monetized.

## Part 2: How Do You Get Paid on YouTube?

We know that making money from YouTube can be challenging but not impossible. We'll help you figure out how to get paid. Whether you want to create your videos and monetize them or you want to take advantage of the huge pool of talent. We'll show you what the impact of the Youtube Partner program is on the revenue of YouTube channel owners:

### Video length

One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length. A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.

### Ad Quality

The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what's happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you're looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.

### Number of clicks each ad receives

The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes. You can increase your ads' revenue potential by increasing the ad's number of clicks. Advertisers use this metric to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigns, which is why optimizing the number of clicks your ads get is so important.

### Ad Blockers

And there are two problems with ad blocking. The first is that it cuts off revenue. The second problem is that it reduces user engagement. Ad blocking decreases the amount of time that users spend watching videos. Youtube videos that rely on advertising to generate revenue may decrease their income.

## Part 4: Alternative ways to earn more money from YouTube

Some people think they can't make money from YouTube...but that's not true. You can make good money from YouTube, even as a newbie. It just takes some persistence and hard work to make that happen. We'll show you some alternative ways to make more money on YouTube.

### Make Good Content Continuously

Making good content that people love to watch repeatedly is a great way to earn more money. The key is improving the content continuously every week, month, or year.

Creating content that is both entertaining and informative helps people to make decisions. An audience can get a lot of information from the video, but if it is not of good quality, it will not have a good impression.

### Bonus: Spice up your videos with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

A powerful video editing software can help you a lot. With an impactful editor software like Filmora, it allows you to add titles, music, and transition effects to give your video more visual appeal.

![total earnings by channel and video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-does-youtube-pay-you-4.jpg)

The current most popular video editing software application on the market is, hands down, Wondershare Filmora. Editing is incredibly easy with Filmora. Even the most inexperienced user can create a compelling, professional-looking video with Filmora in minutes. With Filmora's video creation tools, anyone can easily edit, add effects, change text, and even make voiceovers. Filmora's intuitive interface is a dream for non-experts as well. Some of its unique features include:

### Stock Media

A royalty-free stock media, smart templates, and visual effects plug-ins will help you add more variety to your videos.

### AI Portrait

### Green Screen

The green screen doesn't just change your background but creates special effects, too.

### Keyframing

It helps your videos look more energetic with smooth animation.

#### Color Correction

Add or make your own stunning 3D LUTs with color correction.

### Join Affiliate

Affiliate marketing is a relatively easy way to turn YouTube viewers into customers. You can join many successful affiliate programs, but if you're looking for the most money, go for the ones that offer a recurring commission.

### Get Brand sponsorships

If you're wondering if getting brand sponsorships for Youtube is worth the money, the answer is a resounding yes. Sponsorships on Youtube generate tons of views and even more engagement than ads do.

But brands tend to sponsor only content deemed relevant to the brand. So if you want to be a sponsored content creator, you must get to know your audience first and then build out your social media strategy around the products you sell and the messages you want to communicate.

## Hot FAQs on YouTube channel monetization

### 1\. What if I don't meet the program threshold?

While trying to meet the threshold, focus on making content that will stand out from the competition and build your channel.

### 2\. If I meet the threshold, do I automatically get into the YouTube Partner Program (YPP)?

No, the Youtube team will review every channel that passes the threshold. You cannot apply to join the YPP if your account has any active Community Guidelines strike. Plus, your channel must follow Youtube policies and guidelines.

### 3\. How much money does 1 million views make?

For every one million views a YouTube video gets, a YouTuber can make upwards of $5000, based on [Forbes's](https://mint.intuit.com/blog/relationships/how-much-do-youtubers-make/#:~:text=their%20videos.%20Using-,Forbes%E2%80%99s,-estimated%20pay%20rate) estimated pay rate of $5\. However, these are estimates, and the amount YouTubers earn from Youtube varies wildly.

## Final Words

This article is a pretty good overview of the "how" of YouTube monetization, though we would also add that it can take a while to build up a following on YouTube if you're starting. You'll want to ensure that you put enough time and effort into your videos.

Your content must be unique so your viewers will want to stick around and engage with you. And lastly, if you're looking to monetize your YouTube channel, focus on building your channel and growing your audience.
