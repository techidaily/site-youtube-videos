Looking at channels that have millions of subscribers or videos that have God knows how many daily views may prompt you to start thinking about buying subscribers for your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not this is a legitimate method of promoting the organic growth of your channel. A lot of people think buying subscribers and viewers is more damaging than it is helpful for YouTubers who opt to go down that road.</p>
<p>Before buying subscribers or views you first must make sure that the provider you’re considering doing business with is trustworthy. It may turn out that the service you purchased subscribers from is a scam designed to take your money. Besides being scammed, there are several other major concerns that make buying subscribers for your YouTube channel a questionable choice.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at how buying subscribers may hurt your channel and ruin your chances of achieving YouTube success.</p>
<h2 id="The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned"><a href="#The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned" class="headerlink" title="The Odds of Getting Banned"></a>The Odds of Getting Banned</h2><p>If you’re considering buying subscribers, your most pressing question might be “Will I get banned?” This is completely within reason because your first concern should be to avoid being penalized by YouTube.</p>
<p>If YouTube’s algorithm catches you buying fake views, your video will be removed. We should specify that “fake views” means “views generated by a bot.”</p>
<p>Buying real human views is a bit of a grey area — not technically against the rules, but frowned upon and potentially risky if the delivery of the views results makes YouTube think you’re using a bot.</p>
<h4 id="What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views"><a href="#What-To-Do-If-You-Get-Caught-For-Fake-Subs-and-Views" class="headerlink" title="What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views"></a>What To Do If You Get Caught For Fake Subs and Views</h4><p>If your video is removed for artificially inflating your view count you can try to restore it by filling out the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802168?hl=en" >YouTube View Abuse Appeal Form <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even if you manage to restore your video, your channel will get a red flag — not the kind you get for copyright violation, but an internal one that keeps the YouTube’s algorithm alert in case you try to do the same thing again.</p>
<p>Being caught more than once gaming the system may result in your videos being permanently removed or your channel being completely suspended. When providers of views and subscribers advertise their services as safe they are actually saying that their service will not raise red flags with YouTube’s algorithm.</p>
<p>The only way in which they can guarantee that is if they intend on delivering high retention views, which means that actual people will click on your video and watch it from the beginning until the end. There are services that have proven to deliver this level of quality, and if you are interested you should check out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>Buy Views Review</strong></a>, which is a site that tests and rates these services.</p>
<p>Buying subscribers is riskier than buying views, but there are still some services that are better than others.</p>
<h4 id="What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Buying-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers"></a>What to Consider When Buying YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>While purchasing subscribers for a YouTube channel that doesn’t really make money is looked upon relatively lightly, buying views or subscribers to gain profit is an entirely different matter.</p>
<p>As you probably already know, YouTube videos are monetized through AdSense, which has far stricter rules about attempts to trick the system. Getting caught by AdSense may result in being banned from using AdSense, which means that your account will be suspended and you will not be allowed to open another account.</p>
<p>Buying fake views and subscribers to try and turn a profit involves a lot of risks, especially because the financial gain you will be able to make isn’t significant. There are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >other ways to make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than to get subscribers.</p>
<p>The best advice for YouTube creators who want to buy views and subscribers is to go through official channels. The reason for buying real views isn’t technically against the rules is because Google could be said to sell views itself through its ad services. Paying Google for YouTube views is highly unlikely to backfire on you, while you can also consider hiring freelancers to get you legitimate subscribers and views, the quality of their services can range from excellent to terrible and it will be hard to find reliable reviews.</p>
<h2 id="Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers"><a href="#Other-Risks-of-Buying-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Other Risks of Buying Subscribers"></a>Other Risks of Buying Subscribers</h2><p>Besides getting into trouble with YouTube, there are other risks involved with buying subscribers.</p>
<p>The whole idea behind buying fake subscribers is to make your channel look more popular to attract real subscribers, but in order to attract real subscribers, your videos need to rank in YouTube’s search engine. There are legitimate optimization tactics that can help you do that, but it does require more patience.</p>
<p>The amount of time viewers spend watching your video is the most important statistic for determining how well ranked your videos are in search queries on YouTube and if you buy fake views or fake subscribers, the viewer retention rates will remain the same.</p>
<h4 id="Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money"><a href="#Why-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers-Are-a-Waste-of-Money" class="headerlink" title="Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money"></a>Why Fake YouTube Subscribers Are a Waste of Money</h4><p>Buying fake subscribers won’t help get your videos in front of real viewers.</p>
<p>Your channel and your videos will continue to perform poorly in the search results as long as the viewer retention rates remain low. This is because buying subscribers doesn’t mean that you will be buying views or watch time.</p>
<p>In most cases, subscribers who you have paid for will not watch your videos. If your subscriber count suddenly shoots up, but your view count and watch time does not reflect that growth, YouTube’s algorithm will pick up on that. You may not face any official disciplinary action, but the algorithm will ensure that your videos are ranked very low in search results making it impossible to grow.</p>
<h4 id="Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers"><a href="#Alternative-to-Buying-Fake-YouTube-Subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers"></a>Alternative to Buying Fake YouTube Subscribers</h4><p>The best strategy is to grow your channel organically, even though it will take a lot of time. Create a community that loves and follows your work and you will never have to think about how to get fake subscribers.</p>
<p>If you would like to avoid even the slightest possibility of your channel getting hurt, create content that YouTube viewers will enjoy watching or find helpful, and keep making them consistently. It might take a long time, but you will start to see growth.</p>
<p>This is the best way to develop a loyal fan base that will help you get more subscribers. Views and subscribers you get from bot farms, which is where most of the bought subscribers and views come from, maybe excellent at imitating the human online behavior, but there will be consequences if you get caught.</p>
<p>Buying subscribers is unlikely to have a huge effect on the growth rate of your channel. Also, this method for increasing traffic on your channel will not take you a step closer to creating a community of subscribers who can’t wait to watch your next video, which should be the ultimate goal of every aspiring YouTube creator.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we don’t recommend that you buy fake YouTube subscribers.</p>

Looking at channels that have millions of subscribers or videos that have God knows how many daily views may prompt you to start thinking about buying subscribers for your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not this is a legitimate method of promoting the organic growth of your channel. A lot of people think buying subscribers and viewers is more damaging than it is helpful for YouTubers who opt to go down that road.</p>
<p>Before buying subscribers or views you first must make sure that the provider you’re considering doing business with is trustworthy. It may turn out that the service you purchased subscribers from is a scam designed to take your money. Besides being scammed, there are several other major concerns that make buying subscribers for your YouTube channel a questionable choice.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at how buying subscribers may hurt your channel and ruin your chances of achieving YouTube success.</p>
<h2 id="The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned-2"><a href="#The-Odds-of-Getting-Banned-2" class="headerlink" title="The Odds of Getting Banned"></a>The Odds of Getting Banned</h2><p>If you’re considering buying subscribers, your most pressing question might be “Will I get banned?” This is completely within reason because your first concern should be to avoid being penalized by YouTube.</p>
<p>If YouTube’s algorithm catches you buying fake views, your video will be removed. We should specify that “fake views” means “views generated by a bot.”</p>
<p>Buying real human views is a bit of a grey area — not technically against the rules, but frowned upon and potentially risky if the delivery of the views results makes YouTube think you’re using a bot.</p>

Even if you manage to restore your video, your channel will get a red flag — not the kind you get for copyright violation, but an internal one that keeps the YouTube’s algorithm alert in case you try to do the same thing again.</p>
<p>Being caught more than once gaming the system may result in your videos being permanently removed or your channel being completely suspended. When providers of views and subscribers advertise their services as safe they are actually saying that their service will not raise red flags with YouTube’s algorithm.</p>
<p>The only way in which they can guarantee that is if they intend on delivering high retention views, which means that actual people will click on your video and watch it from the beginning until the end.

<p>As you probably already know, YouTube videos are monetized through AdSense, which has far stricter rules about attempts to trick the system. Getting caught by AdSense may result in being banned from using AdSense, which means that your account will be suspended and you will not be allowed to open another account.</p>
<p>Buying fake views and subscribers to try and turn a profit involves a lot of risks, especially because the financial gain you will be able to make isn’t significant. There are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >other ways to make money on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than to get subscribers.</p>

<p>Search for any topic on YouTube and you’ll find thousands of videos. How do you decide which of them to watch? Thumbnails play a major role in what viewers decide to click on. They’re often more important than video titles.</p>
<p>Viewers click on thumbnails that both standout and feel relevant to their search. Your task when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails is to make something that does both of those things while also maintaining your personal style.</p>

You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p>

<h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p>
<h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p>
<p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p>
<p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p>
<p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p>
<p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p>
<p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p>
<p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p>
<p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p>
<p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p>
<p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p>
<p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p>
<h4 id="3-Put-It-Together"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p>
<p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p>
<p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li>
<li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p>
<p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p>
<p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it). Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p>
<p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p>
<p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p>
<p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p>
<h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p>
<p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p>
<h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p>
<h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p>
<p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p>
<p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p>
<h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p>
<p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p>
<h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p>
<p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p>
<p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser. Videos have to be at least 30 seconds long to get moving thumbnails.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-1"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-1" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p>
<p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p>
<p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background-1"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p>
<h4 id="3-Put-It-Together-1"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together-1" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p>
<p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p>
<p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li>
<li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p>
<p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p>
<p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-1"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it). Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p>
<p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p>
<p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p>
<p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p>
<h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-1"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-1" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p>
<p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p>
<h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-1"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-1" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p>
<h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face-1"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face-1" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p>
<p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p>
<p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics-1"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics-1" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p>
<h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-1"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-1" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p>
<p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p>
<h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition-1"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition-1" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p>
<p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-1"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p>
<p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser. Videos have to be at least 30 seconds long to get moving thumbnails.</p>

<p>Search for any topic on YouTube and you’ll find thousands of videos. How do you decide which of them to watch? Thumbnails play a major role in what viewers decide to click on. They’re often more important than video titles.</p>
<p>Viewers click on thumbnails that both standout and feel relevant to their search. Your task when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails is to make something that does both of those things while also maintaining your personal style.</p>

You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-2"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-2" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p>
<h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo-2"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo-2" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p>
<p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p>
<p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p>
<p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p>
<p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-2"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-2" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p>
<p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p>
<p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p>
<p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-2"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-2" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p>
<p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Thumbnails-That-Get-Clicks-Without-Clickbait-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)"></a>Part 4: How to Make Thumbnails That Get Clicks (Without Clickbait!)</h2><p>Here are the top 10 best practices for creating effective YouTube thumbnails:</p>
<h4 id="1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-2"><a href="#1-Show-What-Your-Video-Is-About-2" class="headerlink" title="#1. Show What Your Video Is About"></a>#1. Show What Your Video Is About</h4><p>Being mysterious and clickbaity can get you views, if you’re already big. For small YouTubers, it pays off to be clear about your video’s topic. You want people to click who want to watch the actual content of your video. Even if you manage to get some clicks by being mysterious, you’ll probably end up with low viewer retention because people are clicking away when they realize your video isn’t what they were looking for. That will make YouTube’s algorithm rank your video lower, and then even fewer people will find it.</p>
<p>If your video is a product review, show the product in the thumbnail and maybe even write ‘review’ on it. If your video is a makeup tutorial, show your face with the finished makeup and maybe even include pictures of the products you used. People want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</p>
<h4 id="2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-2"><a href="#2-Use-a-Consistent-Layout-2" class="headerlink" title="#2. Use a Consistent Layout"></a>#2. Use a Consistent Layout</h4><p>As you grow, you’ll want people to be able to see one of your thumbnails and instantly know it’s yours. Building a recognizable brand is about consistency. Try to stick with one basic layout for all of your videos. You can still customize every individual thumbnail by using different facial expressions and different graphics, but try to use similar backgrounds, fonts, and general layouts (i.e. you to the right of the thumbnails, text to the left) over and over.</p>
<h4 id="3-Use-Your-Face-2"><a href="#3-Use-Your-Face-2" class="headerlink" title="#3. Use Your Face"></a>#3. Use Your Face</h4><p>Why should people want to watch your videos? If the answer is ‘because I can teach them to create delicious food’ or ‘because they want to learn about the latest iPhone’ then your thumbnail should include that food or that iPhone.</p>
<p>If part of the reason people want to watch your videos is you – your personality and your sense of humor – then you should be in your thumbnail.</p>
<p>Viewers who are on YouTube because they like seeing a creator’s personality like to feel the presence of that personality in the video thumbnail, and eye contact naturally draws attention and clicks.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Small-Graphics-2"><a href="#4-Add-Small-Graphics-2" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Small Graphics"></a>#4. Add Small Graphics</h4><p>Adding small graphics, like emojis or hearts, to your thumbnail can help you stand out in a couple different ways. First, if they’re being compared to thumbnails that are just screenshots from the video, your thumbnails will look a lot more polished. Second, they’ll add a splash of color which can draw eyes to your video in a search where other thumbnails are not using those same colors.</p>
<h4 id="5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-2"><a href="#5-Your-Text-Should-Be-Huge-2" class="headerlink" title="#5. Your Text Should Be Huge"></a>#5. Your Text Should Be Huge</h4><p>Your thumbnail will end up being a fraction of the size it is while you’re creating it in your thumbnail maker, and that means that any text you use will end up being shrunk down. You could probably type a six-word sentence in a size 18 font and have it look fine while you’re making your thumbnail, but after you upload it there’s no way people will be able to read it at a glance.</p>
<p>Aim for a huge font size, and 3 words or less (so your thumbnail doesn’t end up looking crowded).</p>
<h4 id="6-Check-Out-The-Competition-2"><a href="#6-Check-Out-The-Competition-2" class="headerlink" title="#6. Check Out The Competition"></a>#6. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Type your video’s title or topic into the search engine on YouTube and look at the thumbnails for the videos that come up. These are your competition. You want to make a thumbnail that is similar enough to what comes up that viewers know it’s on the same topic, but different enough that it stands out.</p>
<p>Generally, if most of the thumbnails have the same layout, you’ll want to mimic that layout. Where you can break from the crowd is in the colors, fonts, and graphics you use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-2"><a href="#Part-5-Animated-YouTube-Thumbnails-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails"></a>Part 5: Animated YouTube Thumbnails</h2><p>Whether or not you upload a custom thumbnail to YouTube, YouTube’s A.I will choose what it thinks are the 3 juiciest seconds of your video (you cannot choose for yourself) and play them as a GIF-like animation when people mouseover your video thumbnails.</p>
<p>As of now, this only works in the Google Chrome desktop browser. Videos have to be at least 30 seconds long to get moving thumbnails.</p>

<p>Search for any topic on YouTube and you’ll find thousands of videos. How do you decide which of them to watch? Thumbnails play a major role in what viewers decide to click on. They’re often more important than video titles.</p>
<p>Viewers click on thumbnails that both standout and feel relevant to their search. Your task when it comes to creating YouTube thumbnails is to make something that does both of those things while also maintaining your personal style.</p>

You can use an image editing program like Photoshop if you have one, but if you don’t you can check out these <a href="#makers">free thumbnail makers</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of popular thumbnail styles.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/popular-youtube-thumbnail-layout.jpg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-3"><a href="#1-The-Classic-Thumbnail-Photo-or-Screenshot-3" class="headerlink" title="1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)"></a>1. The Classic Thumbnail (Photo or Screenshot)</h3><p>A photo that shows what happens in your video – whether that means the finished ‘look’ from your makeup tutorial or you posing in front of the landmark you shot your travel vlog in front of – is a great way to let viewers know what to expect. While curiosity can be a big motive behind clicking on a video thumbnail (or anything online), when people have searched for a specific topic they want to be convinced that your video has what they’re looking for.</p>
<h4 id="1-Choose-Your-Photo-3"><a href="#1-Choose-Your-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="#1. Choose Your Photo"></a>#1. Choose Your Photo</h4><p>To start off, either choose a still frame from your video or take a photograph while you’re still set up from your video. A separate photograph is usually a better idea because your video editor might not be able to export a high-quality snapshot, and also because you’re able to choose your facial expression.</p>
<p>Aim to make this shot a close-up or medium close-up and make sure you’re either in the center of the screen or off to one side, as per the ‘rule of thirds’. Many cameras allow you to bring an optional grid up onto your viewfinder. This will divide your screen into three equal segments both vertically and horizontally. Try to make sure your eyes line up with the top line, and if you’re going to be off to one side then make sure you’re on one of the vertical lines. This will ensure your image is visually appealing.</p>
<p>If you want to add text later, it’s a good idea to be off to one side.</p>
<p>Including your face is important for most types of YouTube videos. People are attracted to eye contact and are more likely to click on thumbnails that feature a face. Gamers might choose to use a picture of a video game character instead and it will have the same effect.</p>
<p>Some situations where it isn’t essential to include your face include tech reviews, where viewers will be more interested in seeing the product, and cooking videos where people are looking to be tempted by a yummy food pic.</p>
<h4 id="2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-3"><a href="#2-Add-Text-and-or-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images"></a>#2. Add Text and&#x2F;or Images</h4><p>This part isn’t essential – in some cases, a photo is enough – but a lot of the thumbnails for the videos ranked highest in YouTube’s search results include either a couple of words of text, a simple graphic (i.e. an emoji), or both.</p>
<p>In some cases you might use text to make it clear what type of video you’ve made, i.e. ‘review’ or ‘tutorial’. It’s best to keep any text you use brief, but you could get a bit more descriptive and write something like ‘fall makeup tutorial’. Three words is probably the most you can get away with. Remember that your text will be shrunk down with the rest of your image; you need to make it big enough to read easily once it’s shrunk, and that means you don’t have a ton of room for text.</p>
<p>You should also avoid fonts that are harder to read. Fonts with a lot of curves can be harder to read, and you want to make sure you choose a color that stands out from your background. Yellow might work against black, but it probably won’t work against the beige wall of your sunny bedroom. Sans serif fonts tend to be best.</p>
<p>Another tactic used in successful thumbnails is to add small graphics, like emojis or small images (i.e. pumpkins for a Halloween video), which are related to your video’s content. As with text, you don’t want to overload your thumbnail with images, but they’re a great way to add something eye-catching that’s a bit different from competing thumbnails.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-3"><a href="#2-The-Emotional-Laser-Background-Face-Reacting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)"></a>2. The Emotional Laser (Background + Face Reacting)</h3><p>One increasingly popular style of YouTube thumbnail is what we’re going to call the ‘Emotional Laser’. It’s bright (like, blindingly bright), it communicates a clear feeling, and it creates high expectations for how exciting the video’s content is going to be.</p>
<p>The three main elements of the Emotional Laser thumbnail are a background (usually bright), your face on the right wearing an over-pronounced expression, and either the thing your expression is in reaction to (i.e. food, a product, the topic of your video in text) or reinforcement of your emotion (i.e an emoji or question marks) on the left.</p>

<h4 id="1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-3"><a href="#1-Ham-It-Up-Take-Your-Reaction-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)"></a>#1. Ham It Up (Take Your Reaction Photo)</h4><p>Take a high-quality photograph of yourself conveying strong emotion. Generally, you want to look extremely excited, disgusted, angry, or shocked depending on the theme of the video.</p>
<p>If there’s an object you want to include in your thumbnail, like a product you’ll be talking about, then it’s a good idea to hold it for this photo. Hold it to one side of your head, turn towards it slightly (but not so much that the camera can only see the side of your face) and put on the expression that’s supposed to be a reaction to the object.</p>
<p>It can be a good idea to take this photo in front of a solid color so you can remove the background easily with chroma key.</p>
<h4 id="2-Choose-Your-Background-3"><a href="#2-Choose-Your-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="#2. Choose Your Background"></a>#2. Choose Your Background</h4><p>Your background might be scenery, a solid color, or even the room you filmed the video in. Light or bright colors are popular. Make sure there’s nothing that will distract from your expression. If your background is a room, or anything else where there could be things like pictures hanging, you may want to add a blur effect in the next step.</p>
<h4 id="3-Put-It-Together-3"><a href="#3-Put-It-Together-3" class="headerlink" title="#3. Put It Together"></a>#3. Put It Together</h4><p>In your thumbnail maker or a program like Photoshop, you’ll need to put your photo and your background together. This will work differently depending on what program you use. If your program has a chroma key tool and your reaction photo was taken against a solid color then you can make that solid color transparent.</p>
<p><strong><em>What if I don’t have a separate background?</em></strong> If you don’t have a background you want to use, but you still want your reaction to stand out the same way it would if you did, then you can use your photo editor’s blur tool to turn the normal background of your photo into something you can pop-out from.</p>
<h4 id="4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-3"><a href="#4-Add-Extras-Text-Emojis-etc-3" class="headerlink" title="#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)"></a>#4. Add Extras (Text, Emojis, etc.)</h4><p>If instead of an object you plan to fill the other side of your thumbnail with text, question marks, emojis, or some other graphic element then now is the time to add it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Part 2: How to Upload a YouTube Thumbnail</h2><p>When you upload a new video to YouTube, you will see a <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video thumbnails</strong> after your upload is complete.</p>
<p>If you want to add a custom thumbnail to a video that’s already up, that’s easy too.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong>Video Manager</strong> in the <strong>Creator Studio</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the video you want to change the thumbnail for and click <strong>Edit</strong> next to it.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Custom thumbnail</strong> on the right of the preview screen.</li>
<li>Upload your thumbnail and click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember when you’re uploading custom thumbnails that you need to use a .JPG, .GIF, .BMP, or .PNG image with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and that your file size has to be under 2MB.</p>
<p>YouTube recommends that thumbnail images have a resolution of <strong>1280x720px</strong>, and you cannot upload an image with a width of less than 640 pixels.</p>
<p>Make sure that all of your thumbnails adhere to YouTube’s Community guidelines. Anything sexually suggestive, violent, or otherwise graphic could result in your video being age-restricted.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-3"><a href="#Part-3-YouTube-Thumbnail-Makers-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers"></a>Part 3: YouTube Thumbnail Makers</h2><p>You don’t have to go out and buy a photo editor like Photoshop to make custom video thumbnails (although it’s a good thing to use if you already have it). Here are two free online programs you can use instead:</p>
<p><strong>Canva</strong> is an intuitive option with templates for Thumbnails, Channel Art, and other social media graphics. There are stock photos and graphics provided, but not all of them are free (paid options cost $1 each). Canva’s templates do tend to include paid resources, so you may want to use them mostly for their layouts or as inspiration and replace everything they provide with your own images.</p>
<p>Generally, using Canva is as easy as dragging and dropping things where you want them. You’ll be able to set the dimensions for your project so the image you export is a perfect size. Adding text and changing the size, font, or color is easy too.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Spark</strong> also has templates for channel art, and it’s also very easy to use. The first time you use it helpful notes will pop up to guide you through the process. Using templates is especially simple because you just click on the elements in the pre-made thumbnail and replace them with your own photos&#x2F;text.</p>
<p>You can make changes to the colors in your Spark thumbnail easily by selecting a new color scheme or filter. You can even toggle through layouts easily. When you choose a new layout, Spark will rearrange all the pieces of your current thumbnail to align with the new layout so you can quickly see what it looks like instead of having to rebuild.</p>
