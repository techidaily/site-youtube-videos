People will subscribe when they feel invested in you as a person, and that happens when they feel like you are being sincere. You do not need to share all of your innermost secrets on your vlog, but you should let your viewers feel like they know you.</p>

Don’t forget to add a call to action</h3><p>Some people need to be prompted to subscribe to your channel, no matter how much they enjoy your content. At the end of all your videos, ask your viewers to subscribe to your channel and like your social media page.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to explain the benefits of subscribing to them, such as to benefit from your informative tips and gain a deeper insight into your projects. If you have any interesting videos in the pipeline, let them know about them.</p>

Listen To Your Subscribers</h3><p>It feels nice to get positive comments on your videos. If people feel comfortable enough to leave you suggestions and requests then that is even better. It means that you have succeeded in making them feel like they are part of your community.</p>
<p>If you get a video request, try to do it. People like to feel that you are open to trying the things they want to see. However, there are also times when you should just ignore requests and suggestions. If the majority of your subscribers enjoy your jokes and you get one comment telling you to stop trying to be funny then it is fairly obvious that that ‘suggestion’ does not really reflect the wishes of your community.</p>

Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.</p>
<p>Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end. The more effort you put into your videos, the bigger the rewards are likely to become.

Make a Schedule and Stick To It</h3><p>You want to vlog at least once a week, and making a schedule will help you keep on top of that. It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.</p>
<p>Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.</p>
<h3 id="5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers"><a href="#5-Collaborate-With-Other-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers"></a>5. Collaborate With Other Vloggers</h3><p>Collaboration videos are always big hits. When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.</p>
<p>Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.</p>

<p>Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.</p>
<h3 id="4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return"><a href="#4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return" class="headerlink" title="4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return"></a>4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return</h3><p>Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else’s positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p>
<p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.</p>
<h3 id="5-Reach-out-on-social-media"><a href="#5-Reach-out-on-social-media" class="headerlink" title="5. Reach out on social media"></a>5. Reach out on social media</h3><p>YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p>

And again</h3><p>You aren’t going to see great results overnight. You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.</p>
<p>When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What’s your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.</p>

Your trailer gives you a valuable opportunity to quickly explain what your channel is all about and what the benefits of following you are.</p>
<p>Don’t waffle on – try to get your clip down to 90 seconds maximum. Include clips from your videos and don’t forget to add a strong call to action at the end.

Make a Schedule and Stick To It</h3><p>You want to vlog at least once a week, and making a schedule will help you keep on top of that. It will also give your subscribers a chance to anticipate your videos and get excited. They are more likely to watch an update they have been expecting than one that was not already on their minds.</p>
<p>Sticking to your schedule is a good wait to build up credibility with your audience, but late or skipped updates will cause you to lose that credibility. If you do not post for a month then people who already subscribed to you might still ignore your update because it has been too long and they forgot about you.</p>

Collaborate With Other Vloggers</h3><p>Collaboration videos are always big hits. When you collaborate with another vlogger you are essentially introducing each other to your subscribers. This is a great way to grow your community quickly: by connecting it to another community.</p>
<p>Collaborations work best when the other vlogger is located close enough to you that you can actually meet up, but you can do distance collaborations too. When you collaborate you and the other vlogger should have close to the same number of subscribers, so the video will benefit you both equally.</p>

This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos.

<p>In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don’t need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return.

This proven method involves networking with other creators! Making your presence felt on YouTube is an important part of creating your network of subscribers that watch, share and talk about your videos. Interaction with your subscribers, reaching new audiences every day, and a plethora of other factors influence how well your YouTube channel is doing.</p>
<p>In this part, we will show you how you can build your own network of loyal YouTube supporters and prove that you don’t need the services of paid providers who promise better reach for your channel.</p>
<h3 id="1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche-2"><a href="#1-Find-YouTubers-in-your-niche-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Find YouTubers in your niche"></a>1. Find YouTubers in your niche</h3><p>The first step to building an enviable army of YouTube subscribers starts with the realization that you are not alone. Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.</p>
<h3 id="2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like-2"><a href="#2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like"></a>2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like</h3><p>Of the channels you found in Step 1, choose the ones you genuinely like and subscribe to them.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return. By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel’s owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.</p>
<h3 id="3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day-2"><a href="#3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Spend time watching videos each day"></a>3. Spend time watching videos each day</h3><p>Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.</p>
<p>Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.</p>
<h3 id="4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return-2"><a href="#4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return"></a>4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return</h3><p>Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else’s positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p>
<p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.</p>
<h3 id="5-Reach-out-on-social-media-2"><a href="#5-Reach-out-on-social-media-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Reach out on social media"></a>5. Reach out on social media</h3><p>YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again-2"><a href="#6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Do it all again. And again. And again"></a>6. Do it all again. And again. And again</h3><p>You aren’t going to see great results overnight. You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.</p>
<p>When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What’s your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.</p>

<p>If you get a video request, try to do it. People like to feel that you are open to trying the things they want to see. However, there are also times when you should just ignore requests and suggestions. If the majority of your subscribers enjoy your jokes and you get one comment telling you to stop trying to be funny then it is fairly obvious that that ‘suggestion’ does not really reflect the wishes of your community.</p>

Find YouTubers in your niche</h3><p>The first step to building an enviable army of YouTube subscribers starts with the realization that you are not alone. Regardless of the niche, your videos are covering, there are probably thousands of people who are just starting out or that have as many subscribers as your YouTube channel. Focus on finding them. You may even want to make a list.</p>
<h3 id="2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like-3"><a href="#2-Subscribe-to-YouTube-channels-you-really-like-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like"></a>2. Subscribe to YouTube channels you really like</h3><p>Of the channels you found in Step 1, choose the ones you genuinely like and subscribe to them.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that everyone enjoys support, especially if you are not asking for anything in return. By subscribing to YouTube channels in your genre you appreciate, you will make yourself known to the channel’s owner, and there is a chance they will check out and subscribe to your channel.</p>
<h3 id="3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day-3"><a href="#3-Spend-time-watching-videos-each-day-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Spend time watching videos each day"></a>3. Spend time watching videos each day</h3><p>Knowledge is power and, if you want to attract real people to your channel, you should learn how to use your knowledge to your advantage. By paying attention to other new videos in your genre you’ll gain insight into what is going over well with audiences like yours, and what isn’t.</p>
<p>Also, be especially sure to watch videos from those channels you found in Step 1 and subscribed to in Step 2. Try to watch at least two minutes of content from those channels whenever they upload.</p>
<h3 id="4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return-3"><a href="#4-Comment-thoughtfully-Don’t-ask-for-anything-in-return-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return"></a>4. Comment thoughtfully. Don’t ask for anything in return</h3><p>Most YouTubers are delighted to hear someone else’s positive opinion or constructive criticism regarding their work. The reason you are watching 2 minutes of content per video in Step 3 is so that you will really have something to say in this step.</p>
<p>If you do make a thoughtful comment, and especially if you use the time stamp of the part of the video you’re referring to, the video creator will know you have watched the video and that you are not just another spammer. Avoid the sub-4-sub strategy, and don’t be the person who’s always saying ‘Subscribe to my channel’. You will be ignored by both the creator and other viewers, and the creator will find you annoying. However, if you comment regularly without asking for anything, the creator and some of their viewers will naturally decide to check out your channel.</p>
<h3 id="5-Reach-out-on-social-media-3"><a href="#5-Reach-out-on-social-media-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Reach out on social media"></a>5. Reach out on social media</h3><p>YouTube is just one out of many channels through which you can reach like-minded people. Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest or any other social network can help you network with other creators and potential subscribers. Create accounts on social networks you find the most suitable for your video category and share links to your videos on these accounts as often as you can. Furthermore, if you try to foster real discussions about topics that are relevant, people who get to know you through these other platforms will probably decide to check out your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Social media is also a great place to reach out to other creators, whether it’s for collabs or just to chat about doing YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again-3"><a href="#6-Do-it-all-again-And-again-And-again-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Do it all again. And again. And again"></a>6. Do it all again. And again. And again</h3><p>You aren’t going to see great results overnight. You have to spend time almost every day repeating the steps we just described. This might seem intimidating, but as time passes it will become routine.</p>
<p>When you build your presence on YouTube in this way, other creators and their subscribers will naturally start becoming your subscribers. What’s your best tip for free YouTube subscribers?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Some people might need to watch multiple videos by you before they decide they want to subscribe. If you stop making videos because you did not get any subscribers or comments on your first few then chances are there were people who were paying attention who may have subscribed if you had kept at it.</p>
