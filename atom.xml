It is evident that a video must have a perfect soundtrack for video masterpieces, but ensuring it is copyright free music is a must.</p><p>It is because you would never want YouTube to remove your video due to copyright violation after working so hard on it. Fortunately, there are a few trusted resources that offer perfect royalty free music for youtube videos.</p><p>Here is a list of 10 best royalty free music for videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Does-‘Royalty-Free’-Mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-Does-‘Royalty-Free’-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean?"></a>Part 1: What Does ‘Royalty Free’ Mean?</h2><p>‘Royalty free’ does not mean that the artist has given up ownership of their music, just that they have licensed it for others to use. Licenses have conditions, but they should not affect your ability to use royalty free music in your vlog. The most common condition for using royalty free music is that you need to credit the artist, which can be as simple as including a ‘music by’ note in your video’s description.</p><p>Because royalty free music still has a copyright claim on it YouTube may occasionally flag your video even though you are only using music you are allowed to use. YouTube’s flagging system is automated and prone to error. If your video is incorrectly flagged you can dispute it with YouTube and get your video cleared again.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-10-Best-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 2: 10 Best Royalty Free Music for YouTube Videos</h2><h3 id="1-YouTube-Audio-Library"><a href="#1-YouTube-Audio-Library" class="headerlink" title="1.

Viewers are more likely to click your cards if there are fewer of them, and more likely to start ignoring them if it seems like they’re always popping up. Also, do not have all three of these cards appear at once and make people choose between them. Stagger them throughout your video.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Your cards should be related to what you are saying in your vlog. Avoid posting completely random links in the middle of your video because a viewer who clicks on them will get confused. You can post any type of link you want at the very end of your video, though.</p><p> <strong>4.</strong> The end of your video is always a great place to link viewers to another of your videos, whether you use a card or an end screen. If somebody liked your video enough to watch until the end they’ll probably welcome a chance to consume similar content.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now, that you are aware how to add YouTube end screen to your video, make use of the amazing features of YouTube end screen and cards and let driving in traffic to your site be easy and fruitful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-captivating-cinematic-experiences-in-youtube-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting Captivating Cinematic Experiences in YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capturing-moving-images-mirrorless-versus-dslr/"><u>2024 Approved  Capturing Moving Images  Mirrorless Versus DSLR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/seamlessly-personalize-your-youtube-shorts-with-custom-thumbnails/"><u>Seamlessly Personalize Your Youtube Shorts with Custom Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/stand-out-in-the-stream-top-name-generators-reviewed/"><u>Stand Out in the Stream  Top Name Generators Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/skyrocket-your-channel-the-ultimate-guide-to-youtube-backlinks/"><u>Skyrocket Your Channel  The Ultimate Guide to YouTube Backlinks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/negative-space-creating-youtube-reverse-videos/"><u>Negative Space  Creating YouTube Reverse Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-essential-insights-on-asmr-videos-unveiled/"><u>[New] Essential Insights on ASMR Videos Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-ever-fading-memories-revived-youtubes-lost-content-hunt/"><u>[Updated] Ever-Fading Memories Revived  YouTube's Lost Content Hunt</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-designing-an-easy-access-subscribe-link-to-channels/"><u>[New] Designing an Easy Access Subscribe Link to Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-iphone-music-video-production-basics/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step  IPhone Music Video Production Basics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-screen-snip-prospects-top-5-capture-tools-reviewed-on-windows-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Screen Snip Prospects  Top 5 Capture Tools Reviewed on Windows for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-compelling-examples-podcast-summaries/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting Compelling Examples  Podcast Summaries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ideal-hosts-maximizing-youtube-video-exposure/"><u>2024 Approved  Ideal Hosts Maximizing YouTube Video Exposure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-premier-alternatives-exceeding-the-limits-of-twitter/"><u>[New] In 2024, Premier Alternatives Exceeding the Limits of Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-cast-motorola-razr-40-to-computer-for-iphone-and-android-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Cast Motorola Razr 40 to Computer for iPhone and Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-windows-11-excellent-video-capture-tools-compared/"><u>[Updated] Windows 11  Excellent Video Capture Tools Compared</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-data-from-apple-iphone-xr-to-zte-phones-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Data from Apple iPhone XR to ZTE Phones | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-maximize-your-library-a-comprehensive-list-of-online-mp3-tag-editor-powerhouses-for-2024/"><u>New Maximize Your Library A Comprehensive List of Online MP3 Tag Editor Powerhouses for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-connectivity-aid-fb-stories-saver-pro/"><u>[Updated] Connectivity Aid  FB Stories Saver Pro</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg"                      alt="Locate enhancements features"                ></p><p> Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video. There is nothing sophisticated there, but it is a really easy and practical solution for those who do not wish to waste time editing. It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg"                      alt="Qucik Fix"                ></p><p> Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements. You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-filters.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Filters"                ></p><p> Blurring Effects are perhaps the most advanced on YouTube Enhancements, and they provide the opportunity to maintain your privacy, by removing people’s distinctive details from the video and blurring them or putting mosaic on their face. With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-costum-blurring.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Costum Blurring"                ></p><p> Once you are done, there is an option to preview the video that you have edited. In this way, you will know if the editions that you have made are sufficient for you or not. Finally, you can choose either to save the video as a new file or revert to the original video. These options are welcome, as sometimes you just do not get what you have expected and you do not want to replace the video you have already uploaded.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Wondershare-Filmora-to-improve-YouTube-videos"><a href="#How-to-Use-Wondershare-Filmora-to-improve-YouTube-videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos"></a>How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos</h2><p> These are the steps that you need to follow, so as to proceed with high-quality video editing on Filmora:</p><ul><li>Open Wordershare Filmora</li><li>Choose if you want 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio</li><li>Tap Import so as to upload the files</li><li>Drag and drop them, in order to place them in the right order</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-videos.jpg"                      alt="Import Video"                ></p><ul><li>Click Edit and adjust the settings (rotation, contrast, saturation, brightness, hue, auto de-noise and speed)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-contrast-saturation.jpg"                      alt="Adjust Contrast Saturation"                ></p><ul><li>Click OK, and you are done with the improvement of Video Quality</li></ul><p> If you wish to fine-tune the images of the videos and place special filters, you can go ahead as follows:</p><ul><li>Tap the Effect button</li><li>Drag the effect you want to use on the timeline (you can choose from a wide variety of effects, including Bokeh and Light Leaks, Old Film, etc.)</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-movie-special-effects.jpg"                      alt="Free Movie Special Effect"                ></p><p> After having finished with the video editing process, you can preview the video and see if it is of acceptable quality standards.

The minimum width of the image is 640 pixels.</li><li>About the YouTube Image thumbnail format: Use .JPG, .PNG, .GIF or .BMP files for your thumbnail image.</li><li>You’ll want your thumbnails to stand out. Bright colored text is a simple, easy way to draw people’s attention. Red, white, yellow, or orange are all popular choices.</li><li>You can even do a little homework to see what colors others are using for similar videos to yours, and then choose different colors to stand out.</li></ul><p>One word of warning: your thumbnail should be related to the content of your video. Misleading thumbnail images, if reported, will reflect poorly on your channel. You’ll get a negative rating in the community status part of your channel.

This part will give you 6 tips on creating thumbnails that help grow your channel. Now let’s learn how to make thumbnails using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-Stay-On-Topic"><a href="#1-Stay-On-Topic" class="headerlink" title="1. Stay On Topic"></a>1. Stay On Topic</h4><p>Your thumbnail should tell a story; it should be clear from looking at it what viewers will get out of watching the video, be it knowledge or entertainment. If your thumbnail sets expectations that your video doesn’t deliver on, people will click away quickly. You may get views quickly, but you won’t get much watch time. That will tell YouTube’s search algorithm ‘people aren’t getting what they want from this, rank it lower’. That leads to fewer views over time, and gives the people who do manage to find your video a negative opinion of your channel.</p><p>Very few people intentionally use thumbnails that have nothing to do with the content of their videos – i.e, most people understand not to use a picture of a kitten in the thumbnail for their tech review, unless maybe their kitten is the one doing the review (which would be adorable, someone should do that). People who want serious advice won’t click, and people who click to see a kitten will click away fast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-should-stay-on-topic.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail Should be relevant"                ></p><p><em>This thumbnail had better be for a kitten’s iPhone review video or people will click away. Fast.</em></p><p>A mistake a lot of creators do make is creating a thumbnail that is meant to evoke an emotion which the video itself does not justify. For example, if you see a picture of a YouTuber looking nervous alongside text that reads ‘My Secret’, you will think they are going to share something deeply personal. You will be curious, and you may even be worried about them. You’ll probably click. Then, if their secret is that they don’t like pineapple on pizza, you’ll probably be angry. This technique gets clicks, but not a lot of watch time and it will lose you subs in the long run.</p><h4 id="2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious"><a href="#2-Don’t-Be-Mysterious" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Be Mysterious"></a>2. Don’t Be Mysterious</h4><p>A good thumbnail doesn’t make people guess. Your thumbnail should tell people what’s in your video, not make them wonder about it. People want to know what they’re being asked to spend time watching.</p><p>Often, they will be looking for the answer to a specific question and will completely ignore anything that doesn’t show – in the thumbnail – that it has their answer.</p><p>Sometimes big channels can get away with stuff like this, because large portions of their audiences are interested in them as people and will already be curious about anything they post. This technique will not bring in new viewers, though.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-tips-2.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail:  Don’t Be Mysterious"                ></p><p><em>If this came up in a search for ‘smoky eye tutorial’, would you click it?</em></p><p>When people want answers, they want to feel confident that they video they click on will have those answers. If you have great content, then let people know it!</p><h4 id="3-People-Like-People"><a href="#3-People-Like-People" class="headerlink" title="3. People Like People"></a>3. People Like People</h4><p>Viewers are more likely to click on a thumbnail if they feel a connection when they look at it. One of the best ways to create a feeling of connection is through eye contact, and you can apply that principle to your YouTube thumbnails easily.</p><p>Just make sure you’re in them.</p><p>You can either compose a photo to use as your thumbnail, or use a screenshot from your video. Ideally, the image of you will convey the emotional tone of the video and tell potential viewers what it is about, besides you.</p><p>So, if you want to post a funny video that is also about making brownies, maybe a picture of you smiling while holding up a tray of brownies would be a better direction than just showing the brownies?</p><h4 id="4-Check-Out-The-Competition"><a href="#4-Check-Out-The-Competition" class="headerlink" title="4. Check Out The Competition"></a>4. Check Out The Competition</h4><p>Before you post your video, type your topic into YouTube’s search engine and see what comes up. This will give you insight into what kinds of thumbnails are performing well for other people, as well as what you can do to stand out in comparison.</p><p><em>Phil starts talking about thumbnails at 6:09, and he has great tips on checking out your competition!</em></p><p>For example, if all five of the top-ranked videos for the search ‘how to build a cabinet’ show images of the YouTuber smiling while holding a power tool, then your thumbnail for a video on the same topic should also be a picture of you smiling and holding a power tool. You know that works, so why not do it?</p><h4 id="5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways"><a href="#5-Use-Color-in-Interesting-Ways" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Color in Interesting Ways"></a>5. Use Color in Interesting Ways</h4><p>You want to use colors that will help you stand out from the other search results. While checking out your competition if you notice that all the people in the other thumbnails are wearing black or navy blue, it will be a good idea for you to wear a brighter color for your shoot to grab a bit more attention.</p><p>Beyond simply using colors that are different from other people’s colors, you should consider the emotions different colors trigger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-use-color.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Thumbnail Making Tips"                ></p><p><em>Maybe don’t use a lot of green and yellow in the thumbnail for your angry video rant?</em></p><h4 id="6-Make-Your-Text-Huge"><a href="#6-Make-Your-Text-Huge" class="headerlink" title="6. Make Your Text Huge"></a>6. Make Your Text Huge</h4><p>Usually, you’ll want to use a bit of text in your thumbnail. It might be the full title of your video, or just a keyword or phrase. You don’t want to use a full sentence because you won’t have room for it if you’re using huge text.</p><p>The reason you should use huge text is so that people can read it. Remember that when people see your thumbnail in their search results, it will be much smaller than it will look while you are creating it. Text that looks big enough while you are creating your thumbnail will be much smaller when people are actually trying to read it, and that goes double for viewers watching on their small smartphone screens.</p><h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail"></a>Frequently Asked Questions about YouTube Thumbnail</h3><h4 id="1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail"><a href="#1-What-is-YouTube-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="1.

It is distracting and makes it difficult to engage with the content of a video. If there is noticeable background noise in a video, even a small noise like the faint hum of a computer fan, then it will increase the chances of viewers clicking away. The good news is that these kinds of noises are fairly easy to get rid of.</p><p>In order to remove background noise from your video clip, you will first need to create an MP3 of your audio. Then you will be able to take out the unwanted noise in a free program called Audacity and reintroduce your corrected audio into your Filmora project. This article will walk you through the audio editing process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/remove-background-noise-from-video.jpg"                      alt="remove background noise from video"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Remove-Background-Noise-from-Your-Youtube-Video-1"><a href="#How-To-Remove-Background-Noise-from-Your-Youtube-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Remove Background Noise from Your Youtube Video"></a>How To Remove Background Noise from Your Youtube Video</h2><h3 id="Background-Noise-Removal"><a href="#Background-Noise-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Background Noise Removal"></a>Background Noise Removal</h3><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Open up Filmora, import your clip, and drag it into the timeline.

Creating An MP3"></a>1.  Creating An MP3</h4><p>If you do not already have it you will need to download VLC Media Player from videoLAN.org. VLC is a completely free media player that can play almost any type of file, is great for converting files, and can even be used as a screen recorder. If you consume a lot of media online then chances are you already have VLC. You could also use is Free Video to MP3 Converter by DVDVideoSoft.</p><p>If you choose to use VLC, open it up and select <strong>Convert&#x2F;Save</strong> under <strong>Media</strong>. Select your video in the <strong>Open Media</strong> window that pops up. After you click <strong>Convert&#x2F;Save</strong> you will be able to choose your format, in this case, MP3, under <strong>Save as type</strong>.</p><h4 id="2-Removing-Background-Noise-in-Audacity"><a href="#2-Removing-Background-Noise-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="2.  Removing Background Noise in Audacity"></a>2.  Removing Background Noise in Audacity</h4><p>You can download Audacity for free at Audacityteam.org.</p><p>Once you have Audacity use it to open your MP3. Then, find a section of your audio that is silent aside from your background noise and highlight it by clicking and dragging. The idea is to point out to the program exactly what sound is a problem for you so it knows what to remove. If you have trouble finding a significant stretch of background noise that does not also include dialogue remember to record a pause before or after the content of your video next time you film.</p><p>With your section of background noise highlighted, go to <strong>Effect</strong> and then <strong>Noise Reduction</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Get Noise Profile</strong>. After that, you will select your entire audio timeline before going back to <strong>Noise Reduction</strong> under <strong>Effect</strong>. This time click on <strong>OK</strong> (the default settings are the best in most situations so you do not need to worry about changing them).</p><p>Audacity will remove everything that sounds like the sound profile, eliminating your background noise. Sometimes this method will also dull your dialogue, which can be fixed by selecting your entire track and then going to <strong>Effect</strong> and <strong>Amplify</strong>. Increasing amplification will fix any muffling of your audio.</p><h4 id="3-Syncing-in-Filmora"><a href="#3-Syncing-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="3. Syncing in Filmora"></a>3. Syncing in Filmora</h4><p>Export your corrected MP3 from Audacity and import it into Filmora. Then, drag it into your music track. Syncing your audio should not be difficult, but you can always use your original audio to help you line it up properly if you need to. Just look for a significant spike in your audio waves in both your MP3 and the original audio and make sure they are right on top of each other.</p><p>Then, since you no longer need your original audio, you can delete it. Right-click on your clip and select <strong>Audio Detach</strong>. Once your audio is on its own track just select it and click delete.</p><h3 id="Covering-Background-Noise"><a href="#Covering-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Covering Background Noise"></a>Covering Background Noise</h3><p>Sometimes background noise is so minor that you do not want to bother going through the process of removing it. In these situations, it may be easier to cover up your background noise than to remove it. This is as simple as dragging a song into the music track of your timeline and adjusting its volume so it is not loud enough to draw attention away from your dialogue. Chances are you want to add background music anyways and this is not even an extra step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/streaming-success-with-top-tier-tech/"><u>Streaming Success with Top-Tier Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-best-recording-equipment-for-creating-youtube-masterpieces/"><u>[Updated] Best Recording Equipment  For Creating YouTube Masterpieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-earning-edge-exploiting-youtube-studio-for-global-viewers/"><u>[New] Earning Edge  Exploiting YouTube Studio for Global Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-banishing-the-blank-screen-from-youtube-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Banishing the Blank Screen From YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/16-best-kickstart-videos-on-youtube-for-visibility-boost/"><u>16 Best Kickstart Videos on YouTube for Visibility Boost</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/the-leading-17-lights-and-stands-reviewed/"><u>The Leading 17 Lights & Stands Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-channel-success-across-social-networks-youtube-plus-more/"><u>2024 Approved  Channel Success Across Social Networks  YouTube + More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensive-review-evolution-of-digital-entertainment/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensive Review  Evolution of Digital Entertainment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-acquiring-free-music-youtube-video-edition/"><u>2024 Approved  Acquiring Free Music  YouTube Video Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-the-perfect-close-youtubes-free-end-screen-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting the Perfect Close  YouTube's Free End Screen Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-maximize-gaming-essential-tips-and-picks-for-the-best-monitors-for-xbox-series-x/"><u>[Updated] Maximize Gaming - Essential Tips & Picks for the Best Monitors for Xbox Series X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/nailing-your-online-visibility-with-optimal-youtube-thumbnail-dimensions-for-2024/"><u>Nailing Your Online Visibility with Optimal YouTube Thumbnail Dimensions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/guide-to-the-elite-audiovideo-makers-web-for-2024/"><u>Guide to the Elite Audio/Video Makers Web for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-videography-with-your-macs-webcam-5-easy-ways-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Videography with Your Mac's Webcam (5 Easy Ways) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unravel-the-art-of-using-gifs-on-discord-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unravel the Art of Using GIFs on Discord - A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/locked-out-of-apple-iphone-15-plus-5-ways-to-get-into-a-locked-apple-iphone-15-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Locked Out of Apple iPhone 15 Plus? 5 Ways to get into a Locked Apple iPhone 15 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-blueprint-for-winning-campaigns-snapchat-edition/"><u>In 2024, The Blueprint for Winning Campaigns  Snapchat Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleash-your-creative-potential-with-these-5-leading-audio-distortion-programs/"><u>New In 2024, Unleash Your Creative Potential with These 5 Leading Audio Distortion Programs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-examining-video-comments-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Examining Video Comments on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-instant-video-posting-to-twitter-from-phone-avoid-the-retweet/"><u>[New] In 2024, Instant Video Posting to Twitter From Phone – Avoid the Retweet</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.</strong></p><p>YouTube is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms today. The amount of time we spend watching YouTube videos daily is simply mindboggling. The amazing thing about YouTube is how easy it is to share content and, in the process, build your audience. Many people have launched careers on the success of their videos and the popularity of their channels. It doesn’t matter if you are an expert, a hobbyist, an aspiring musician, a citizen journalist, a DIY maven, a cook, or a makeup fiend – YouTube can help you reach more people, develop your brand and launch your new career. All you have to do is create your channel, upload good videos, promote your content, and watch the magic happen. Well, if only it were that simple…</p><p>In reality, getting people to watch your content can be difficult. Even for people who have large personal networks, hitting 5000 or 10000 views can be tough. The reason is simply that YouTube videos, like other web content, thrive on Social Proof, and Social Proof equals credibility. The more views a video has, the more people are willing to watch it, and the better its chances of featuring as recommended content. It’s a vicious cycle. Time and time again, we see that given the choice, people would rather watch a video with 2000 views instead of a video with 200 views.</p><p>This is why <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >buying YouTube views can be a great way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to jumpstart the organic views of your content. It’s no silver bullet of course, but it can get you off to a good start. Buying YouTube views can help your video gain traction and get recommended. The trick is to buy from sources that provide real US and UK views in ways that do not violate YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). There are many scam services out there that can get your video the wrong kind of attention. Be sure to do your research before you buy, and understand that this is a tactic which promises short-term results. Buying YouTube views can be useful. However, it is no guarantee of long-term success. You still need to put hard work into your content for it to work.</p><h2 id="WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS"><a href="#WHERE-TO-BUY-VIEWS" class="headerlink" title="WHERE TO BUY VIEWS"></a>WHERE TO BUY VIEWS</h2><p>These top 5 sites for buying YouTube views are ranked according to the quality of the targeted views they deliver, viewer engagement, responsiveness, turnaround time, and their moneyback guarantee (if they have one). The site which tested these services is called <a href="http://buyviewsreview.com/"><strong>BuyViewsReview</strong></a>. To learn more about the top providers of YouTube views, and how you can avoid scams, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> you want ‘high retention views’ – views where your video has been watched for a significant period, not just clicked on. These will help your search engine rankings.</p><h3 id="1-DEVUMI"><a href="#1-DEVUMI" class="headerlink" title="1. DEVUMI"></a>1. DEVUMI</h3><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://devumi.com/" >Devumi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> is our #1 pick for buying YouTube views because it provides the best value for money. To start with, all Devumi’s packages come with likes included so there’s no need to shop around for engagement and retention after buying views from Devumi. They have a 100% money-back guarantee and some of the fastest turnaround time available on the market (for genuine high-retention views. Some bot services are faster, but it’s against YouTube’s TOS to use bots).</p><h3 id="2-BuyViews"><a href="#2-BuyViews" class="headerlink" title="2. BuyViews"></a>2. BuyViews</h3><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://buyviews.co/" >BuyViews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> come in at a close second to Devumi. They offer various social promotion options along with their packages. They also have an impressive 60% – 90% retention rate as well as a 100% moneyback guarantee. However, their turnaround time isn’t as good as Devumi’s. Also, they provide no time guarantee on their retention rate.</p><h3 id="3-MarketingHeaven"><a href="#3-MarketingHeaven" class="headerlink" title="3. MarketingHeaven"></a>3. MarketingHeaven</h3><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://themarketingheaven.com/" >MarketingHeaven <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> makes buying YouTube views very easy. On their homepage, you can add the link to the video you’d like to promote, select the number of views you want from a dropdown list and top it off with an optional selection of likes. While this ease of use is a plus, MarketingHeaven is a bit more expensive than the top 2 sites on this list, and it provides no retention guarantee. Also, it takes longer to see results and it provides no options for social promotion.</p><h3 id="4-500VIEWS"><a href="#4-500VIEWS" class="headerlink" title="4. 500VIEWS"></a>4. 500VIEWS</h3><p>On <em><a class="link"   href="http://500views.com/" >500VIEWS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em> you can buy everything, including YouTube views, likes, comments, and subscribers. They have an add-ons system that’s very easy to use. However, they don’t deliver on quality, retention, engagement, and customer support like the top 3 sites. It can also take up to 1 week to get results from 500VIEWS.</p><h3 id="5-Social-Shop"><a href="#5-Social-Shop" class="headerlink" title="5. Social Shop"></a>5. Social Shop</h3><p><em>Social Shop</em> has a very nice mix of packages. At the lowest end, they have the micro package which gets you 1000 views for $2, and at the high end, they have the Pro package which gets you 1,000,000 views for $999. Considering this range of options, their turnaround time of 2 days isn’t bad at all. However, Social Shop has limited engagement options. Unlike other sites on this list, they do not provide likes, comments, or subscribers. Their customer support also doesn’t compare too well against others on this list.</p><h2 id="HOW-DOES-IT-WORK"><a href="#HOW-DOES-IT-WORK" class="headerlink" title="HOW DOES IT WORK?"></a>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2><p>Buying YouTube views is easy and safe if you buy from reliable sources like the sites at the top of the list above. It also helps to know how YouTube judges view to understand why it’s important to choose the right source.</p><p>YouTube ranks views based on the location of the viewers and the quality of viewer engagement. When a user who is based in the US or UK uploads a video and it gets most of its views from Russia or Asia, that raises a red flag. YouTube checks to see that a good number of video viewers are part of the user’s target demographic, and that makes sense. You want targeted YouTube views because that can boost organic retention rates significantly. Untargeted views can lead to a high bounce rate which can lead YouTube to conclude that your video has been mistitled, among other things.</p><p>The best sellers of YouTube views go the extra mile to provide a mixed demographic of views with targeted hits from the US and UK to avoid the wrong kind of attention.</p><p>Some sellers simply rent IPs from different places and send them to the video link. While this method might not be detected by YouTube, it offers very low retention because there are no real people behind those IP addresses. It is always best to buy from sellers who can send real people to watch, like, and comment on your videos. Anything else is risky and can bring your content under increased scrutiny from YouTube.</p><h2 id="WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE"><a href="#WHAT-TO-LOOK-FOR-IN-A-GOOD-VIEW-BUYING-WEBSITE" class="headerlink" title="WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE"></a>WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A GOOD VIEW-BUYING WEBSITE</h2><p>The most important thing to look for in a good view buying website is a guarantee that you’ll be getting real humans, not bots, to watch your video. This is the only way to get organic retention and engagement from your purchase. While robots will inflate your views, there’ll be little else to show for those high numbers. Bot views won’t help you rank in search results, and they may hurt your chances of ranking (they also violate YouTube’s TOS and can get your videos taken down). With human views, things can be different.</p><p>Bear in mind that buying views will not guarantee long-term success or impactful engagement. This is why buying YouTube views is seen as a short-term tactic for jumpstarting organic growth and not something to keep on doing forever. Content creators still have to promote their content and build real relationships with their viewers to see meaningful results in the long term.</p><p>Next, you want to be sure that your view buying website can deliver targeted views. If you’re based in the UK, you want views from the UK, US, Australia, and Canada. Views originating predominantly from Russia or certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia could give you away, and you’d run the risk of disciplinary action from YouTube. Buying views isn’t technically against the rules, as long as they are human views, but if YouTube suspects there is a bot at work then they won’t be interested in any appeals about how ‘the service said they didn’t use bots’.</p><p>It’s also important to buy from providers whose viewers are active on YouTube. Their history of activity on YouTube will only boost the credibility of their views and by extension, the credibility of your video and its growing popularity.</p><p>Finally, you want to avoid sellers who provide views in a way that can put you at risk. Sites that provide views from similar IPs and same browsers with the same or similar cookies are just too obvious. YouTube can pick-up on that kind of activity and you could potentially have a problem on your hands.</p><h2 id="IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL"><a href="#IS-BUYING-VIEWS-ILLEGAL" class="headerlink" title="IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?"></a>IS BUYING VIEWS ILLEGAL?</h2><p>No. This goes double for users who are not monetizing their content. Videos that promote violence and copyright violations are illegal. Buying views is not against the law, or even YouTube’s Terms of Service depending on where your views come from.</p><p>YouTube’s TOS does state clearly that partners are not to engage third parties to “… generate artificial subscribers or views.” Partners are generally understood to be users who are monetizing their channels through affiliate programs or AdSense, and ‘artificial’ means the views need to come from a bot to be against the rules. However, some interpret this to mean that buying YouTube views is against the TOS for all users. It seems like YouTube would rather you not buy views at all since the language is ambiguous, but since there’s a way in which buying ads through Google for your channel could be seen as buying views they haven’t formally outlawed it. Whatever your perspective, there’s no denying that buying views is a risky business. This is all the more reason you should choose the sites you buy from carefully.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that tech companies like Google constantly review their policies. Bloggers have had to change tactics with changes to Google’s search engine algorithm. There’s no telling how things may change or evolve with YouTube in the future. That is why we strongly recommend that you buy views from websites that can deliver real human views with strong guarantees of service delivery and reliable turnaround times. Anything short of this could expose you and your content to the kind of attention you certainly don’t want.</p><h2 id="WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE"><a href="#WILL-BUYING-VIEWS-GET-ME-BANNED-FROM-YOUTUBE" class="headerlink" title="WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?"></a>WILL BUYING VIEWS GET ME BANNED FROM YOUTUBE?</h2><p>As mentioned above, buying views alone is unlikely to get you banned from YouTube. The worst-case scenario is that your video may be taken down for ‘view count gaming’ and even then, there’s an appeals process. The important thing is to understand Google and YouTube’s Terms of Service (TOS). Only explicit and egregious violations of their TOS could get your banned. You should also be mindful that community policing is a big part of how YouTube discovers users who may violate their TOS. If many viewers flag your video for takedown due to copyright violation or abusive content, that can lead to serious disciplinary action from YouTube and in some cases, you may be banned for life.</p><p>That’s why it’s important to buy likes and comments as well if you’re going to buy a large number of views – lots of views and no engagement will make organic viewers think you used a bot and they may report you.</p><p>Buying YouTube views is not illegal and certainly will not incur the same kind of disciplinary action as clear violations of YouTube’s TOS. What matters is that you buy your views in a way that won’t attract the wrong kind of attention. YouTube will sometimes flag videos for view auditing. If views are found to be fake, the view count is dropped to exclude fake views. If this has happened to you after you bought YouTube views, be wary of buying from the same source again. If your video is repeatedly found to be attracting purchased fake views, it may be taken down.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We see videos with thousands and millions of views so often that it’s easy to forget just how difficult it can be to get people to watch your videos. YouTube is very competitive, and it takes time to build a reputation, and the following needed to become a YouTube star.</p><p>To compete for viewer attention and engagement, it helps to have good numbers. Buying views can give you an edge by telling people that your content is worth their time. Just be sure to buy your views from the right sources. And after you’ve bought your views, do your part to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >promote your video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on YouTube and other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Also, engage with your audience and create content consistently. With all these in place, your audience will grow organically, and eventually, you may get your moment in the spotlight.</p><p> What do you think?

It is to see from these statistics why every video aspiring YouTubers post on their channels has to be perfect in every way in order to reach a wide audience. Fortunately, trimming a video even after you’ve uploaded it to YouTube is a quick and easy process, and in this article, we are going to show you a few different methods you can use to trim the videos you upload to YouTube. So, let’s get started.</p><hr><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><ul><li><a href="#part1">How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Trimming a Video Before Posting On YouTube with Filmora Video Editor [4 Ways]</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="How-to-Trim-a-Video-After-You-Upload-it-to-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#How-to-Trim-a-Video-After-You-Upload-it-to-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?"></a>How to Trim a Video After You Upload it to Your YouTube Channel?</h2><p>The <strong>YouTube Studio</strong> is no longer in beta phase, which means that the feature is here to stay. This is good news for all video creators who frequently update their YouTube videos after they upload them, as they no longer have to go through the endless uploads just because they wanted to trim a video.</p><p>Make sure that you’re signed into your YouTube channel, then click on your <strong>profile picture</strong> and select the <strong>YouTube Studio (Beta)</strong> option. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see a menu that contains different subcategories like <strong>Analytics, Dashboard or Videos</strong>, so just click on the <strong>Videos</strong> option and proceed to select a video you’d like to trim. After the Videos submenu appears on the screen you should click on the <strong>Editor</strong> option and the video you selected will open in the YouTube’s video editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-editor-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube videos after uploading"                ></p><p>Click on the <strong>Trim button</strong> to start trimming the video and drag the <strong>blue bars</strong> located at the start and the end of the file to designate the portion of the video you’d like to remove. Preview the changes and confirm what you’ve made by clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button located in the upper right corner of the screen and the new shortened version of the video will become available within a couple of hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-save-video-trimming-youtube-studio.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio - Trim YouTube videos after uploading"                ></p><p>In this way, you don’t need to take down the original video, edit it and re-upload.

Filmora video editing software for PC and Mac computers offers a few different tools for trimming videos. After you’ve created a new project in Filmora, you should import a video clip into the editor by clicking on the <strong>Import</strong> drop-down menu and select the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Each file you add to a project will be displayed in the <strong>Media tab</strong>, and you can just <strong>drag and drop</strong> it to a video track on the timeline.</p><p>All you have to do in order to trim a video after you’ve placed it on the timeline is drag <strong>one of its ends to the left or to the right</strong>. As you drag one of the clip’s edges the editor will only display <strong>the remaining footage</strong> while rendering the rest invisible. If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to <strong>extend the file by dragging it</strong> until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool"></a>Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool</h4><p>Filmora’s <strong>Split tool</strong> can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply <strong>place the playhead</strong> at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make <strong>a cut</strong>, and click on the <strong>Split icon</strong> that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Scene Detection"></a>Method 3: Using Scene Detection</h4><p>Wondershare’s video editor also offers an <strong>automatic way to split a video</strong> clip into a number of separate scenes. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the <strong>Scene Detection</strong> option from the menu and proceed to click on the <strong>Detect button</strong>, after the <strong>Scene Detection window</strong> pops up on the screen. The software will then <strong>automatically analyze the footage</strong> and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the <strong>Add to Timeline button</strong> once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection-interface.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Scene Detection Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool"></a>Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool</h4><p>The <strong>Instant Cutter Tool</strong> enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora. Select the <strong>Import with Instant Cutter Tool option</strong> from the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and wait for the <strong>Filmora Instant Cutter</strong> window to appear on the screen. In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see <strong>Trim and Merge tabs</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>Trim tab</strong> is selected and then click on the <strong>Open File button</strong> to import a video clip you’d like to trim. You can then use <strong>the trimming sliders</strong> to designate the parts of the video you’d like to remove or the set the <strong>In and Out points</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Set In Point or Set Out Point icons</strong>. Click on the <strong>Export button</strong> to save the new version of the video clip and <strong>click OK</strong> to complete the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instant-cutter-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Instant Cutter Tool"                ></p><h2 id="Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Using-Online-Video-Editing-Platforms-to-Trim-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos"></a>Using Online Video Editing Platforms to Trim YouTube Videos</h2><p>In case you’re looking for a tool that lets you save extracts of scenes from YouTube to your computer free of charge <a class="link"   href="https://ytcutter.com/" >YT Cutter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> may be one of your best options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yt-cutter-youtube-trimmer.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos online"                ></p><p>This online video editing platform is remarkably easy to use since you just have to <strong>copy</strong> <strong>the link to the YouTube video</strong> you’d like to trim into <strong>YT Cutter’s URL box</strong> and then select how long the new video should be.

When someone leaves a mean, negative comment on one of your videos it will likely affect you. It may make you angry, hurt your feelings, or just leave you baffled over how someone could come away from your video with out-of-the-blue opinion the hater has posted. ‘Do not feed the trolls’ is a mantra that can be hard to abide by. This article will explain why you should not engage trolls and how to talk to them if you find yourself doing it anyways.</p><h2 id="How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube"></a>How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube</h2><h4 id="1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll"><a href="#1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll" class="headerlink" title="1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?"></a>1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?</h4><p> The internet is full of trolls and if you continue making YouTube videos – especially videos that get a lot of views – then you are sure to be attacked by a few. Or, alternatively, a troll may attack your other viewers in the comments of your videos. It is extremely easy to be a troll and so there are a lot of them.</p><p> Most trolls are easy to spot. They leave comments designed to hurt you or make you angry, often using over-the-top offensive language. Not all trolls are so obvious, though. Some trolls will be nice at first – flatteringly nice, even – and it will take a few comments before they turn on you or your subscribers. They want you to like them so you put more stock in what they are saying later and take longer to start ignoring them. Some trolls will even go back to being nice to reel you back in.</p><p> It is important to remember that not everybody who leaves negative comments on YouTube videos is a troll. Step back from your emotional reaction to a comment and make sure there is really nothing constructive in it before you dismiss it. Some people have nasty ways of expressing legitimate opinions, and sometimes even when there is no decipherable meaning behind a rude comment the person is not trying to troll you. Some people just have poor communication skills. For example, if someone leaves a comment on your video that consists of only the word ‘bad’ you cannot know for sure what they meant. It could be that they are agreeing with something you mentioned disliking in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls"><a href="#2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls" class="headerlink" title="2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls"></a>2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls</h4><p> Trolls are bored and looking for attention. When you respond, they win. You may think you are demonstrating to them that they were out of line, or logically proving them wrong, but the troll does not care. Your outraged responses are what trolls want and will only entertain them.</p><p> Also, trolls do not care if they are wrong. They almost always seem to think that their opinions are the only ones that count for anything, but quite often their opinions are not even their real opinions. Chances are they do not actually believe anything they are saying to you they just know what to say to make you mad. Remember that you will always be more invested in any interaction you have with a troll than they are. For them it is a game and they cannot lose because they do not really care. If you take the bait it’s fun, and if you do not then they will move on to a target that will. Even if you put hours of effort into chasing off a troll and manage to make them go away they will have enjoyed the whole thing and you will be left exhausted.</p><h4 id="3-But-If-You-Do…"><a href="#3-But-If-You-Do…" class="headerlink" title="3. But If You Do…"></a>3. But If You Do…</h4><p> While you should avoid talking to trolls, sometimes you cannot. Trolls occasionally start off making kind comments or asking legitimate questions to lure you in. You might be a couple comments into a conversation before a troll reveals their true colors.</p><p> There are also times when you respond even though you know you should not because you just cannot let a specific rude comment go unanswered. It is easy to say you should never feed the trolls, but a lot of people cannot help it. If you find yourself engaging a troll there are a few things you can do to try and manage the situation.</p><p> First, avoid using any emotional language; they love that. Keep your responses either pleasantly detached or dry and factual. Say what you feel you need to say and ask the troll for more information. If the troll has made a false claim then ask them for evidence as if you are genuinely interested in learning more. It is highly unlikely they will be able to provide any, although they may make something up. If the troll has made a blanket statement about how terrible they think you are then pretend you either value their input or find them funny and ask them to explain. They will either leave or respond with more insults.</p><p> You will not get the troll to say they were wrong or apologize so that should never be your goal. What you can do is create a public record of the troll being corrected for others to judge for themselves. If you maintain a calm, unaffected, tone then the troll will find you boring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/film-swapping-ideas-best-replacements-1-7/"><u>Film Swapping Ideas  Best Replacements #1-7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-engaging-youtube-thumbnails-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting Engaging YouTube Thumbnails  A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-channeling-wealth-through-beauty-online-platforms/"><u>[Updated] Channeling Wealth Through Beauty Online Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/elevate-engagement-enhancing-videos-with-pro-editing-skills/"><u>Elevate Engagement  Enhancing Videos with Pro Editing Skills</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-deciphering-the-art-of-personalized-playlist-curation-for-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Deciphering the Art of Personalized Playlist Curation for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/the-key-to-wealth-in-web-videos-view-count-imperative/"><u>The Key to Wealth in Web Videos  View Count Imperative</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-achieving-peak-performance-in-video-submissions-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Achieving Peak Performance in Video Submissions on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/quickedit-videotool/"><u>QuickEdit VideoTool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/building-a-successful-career-through-youtube-short-film-making-for-2024/"><u>Building a Successful Career Through YouTube Short Film-Making for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/mastering-video-lighting-techniques/"><u>Mastering Video Lighting Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-quick-guide-incorporating-more-photos-into-your-instagram-story/"><u>In 2024, Quick Guide  Incorporating More Photos Into Your Instagram Story</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-master-your-download-installation-and-usage-of-ez-grabber/"><u>[Updated] Master Your Download  Installation and Usage of EZ Grabber</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/easy-guide-to-vivo-x100-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-by-drfone-android/"><u>Easy Guide to Vivo X100 FRP Bypass With Best Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhance-dji-flight-aesthetics-start-with-free-trial-lutts/"><u>2024 Approved  Enhance DJI Flight Aesthetics – Start With Free Trial LUTTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-10-royale-showdowns/"><u>2024 Approved  Ultimate 10 Royale Showdowns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-touch-screen-on-lenovo-thinkphone-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Lenovo ThinkPhone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-addrom-bypass-an-android-tool-to-unlock-frp-lock-screen-for-your-vivo-t2-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, AddROM Bypass An Android Tool to Unlock FRP Lock Screen For your Vivo T2 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-key-to-captivating-tiktok-audienenas-creative-advertising-insights/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Key to Captivating TikTok Audienenas Creative Advertising Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-top-5-techniques-for-quiet-filming-experiences/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Top 5 Techniques for Quiet Filming Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/legal-music-archives-top-10-websites-for-game-playlists/"><u>Legal Music Archives  Top 10 Websites for Game Playlists</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

These are all industries that understand the value of quality social media content.</p><p> In the video above, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >beauty YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Gena M explains all the ways there are to make money posting makeup and fashion videos on YouTube. Gena’s most important piece of advice for other beauty vloggers is, to be honest. There is nothing wrong with making money from affiliates or sponsors, so long as you only associate with and recommend products you would actually buy.</p><p>Here’s more advice on how you can make money from your makeup videos:</p><h2 id="Sponsorships"><a href="#Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorships"></a>Sponsorships</h2><p>If you are truly passionate about makeup or fashion then you probably have a few favorite brands. Even if you have never really thought about a brand as your favorite, chances are you purchase one or two types of lip gloss – or any other product – over others on a regular basis.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be nice if a company whose product you already love and use in your videos would start paying you just to mention them?</p><p>There are sites called influencer marketing platforms – the most popular one is FameBit – where you can find brands that are looking for creators just like you to work with them on marketing campaigns. Brands post what they are looking for, and you send them proposals for what kinds of videos you want to make for them.</p><p>Sometimes, creating branded content can be as easy as drawing attention to the brand of the eyeliner you use in a few of your tutorials.</p><p>Other times, brands may want you to say specific things or include logos in your videos.</p><p>Make sure to incorporate any brand messages or product placement you agree to do in ways that will feel natural to your viewers. You should let them know that you have a sponsor, and then incorporate the branded content in ways that do not take away from their enjoyment of your videos.</p><h2 id="Ad-Revenue"><a href="#Ad-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Ad Revenue"></a>Ad Revenue</h2><p>Monetizing your videos and earning ad revenue is one of the primary ways beauty vloggers, and all other YouTubers, make money. It takes a long time to earn more than the pocket change from ads, but so long as you keep growing your audience your revenue will keep going up.</p><p>Pay attention to the estimated revenue reports to see which of your videos are earning the most money from ads (they won’t always be your most popular videos). By making more videos on similar topics you will be able to make more money.</p><h2 id="Affiliate-Links"><a href="#Affiliate-Links" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate Links"></a>Affiliate Links</h2><p>By becoming an Amazon affiliate, or joining the affiliate program of another online store, you can make money by including links to products in the descriptions of your video or in your related blog posts.</p><p>For example, if you talk about your new curling iron in a hair tutorial then you can include a special link to it on Amazon. If any of your viewers follow that link and buy it, you earn a percentage of the purchase.</p><p>Even better – if that person keeps shopping, or even skips the curling iron and buys something else, you earn a percentage of any purchase they make on Amazon for a certain period of time.</p><p>Affiliate links are mostly used by bloggers, not YouTubers, but you can still include them in the descriptions of your videos (not YouTube Cards or annotations though). It is not a bad idea for you to create blog posts to accompany your videos and post your affiliate links. Blogs are a great way to generate traffic to your videos.</p><h2 id="Gifts"><a href="#Gifts" class="headerlink" title="Gifts"></a>Gifts</h2><p>Sometimes companies might just give you stuff.</p><p>As your following gets bigger, brands might start sending you samples of their products in the hopes that you will fall in love with them and mention, review, or use them in your videos. This is not the same as a sponsorship because the brand is not paying you for a specific kind of message.</p><p>Receiving these kinds of gifts is not the same as getting paid, but it can certainly save you money on makeup.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-bulk-buy-subscribers-cost-effective-growth-strategy/"><u>In 2024, Bulk Buy Subscribers  Cost-Effective Growth Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-boosting-views-from-zeros-the-top-10-reasons-and-fixes/"><u>[Updated] Boosting Views From Zeros  The Top 10 Reasons & Fixes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-event-ready-top-dj-templates-download-guide/"><u>[New] Event-Ready  Top DJ Templates Download Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/1716464385185-explore-the-finest-movie-series-youtubes-10-pack-no-cost/"><u>Explore the Finest Movie Series  YouTube's 10-Pack, No Cost!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-best-composers-for-the-ultimate-video-photographic-symphony/"><u>[New] Best Composers for the Ultimate Video-Photographic Symphony</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-profit-from-your-youtube-channels/"><u>How to Profit From Your YouTube Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/1716463789597-get-your-hand-on-the-latest-50-youtube-promo-banners/"><u>Get Your Hand on the Latest 50 YouTube Promo Banners!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/elevate-your-video-popularity-essential-seo-techniques-for-success/"><u>Elevate Your Video Popularity  Essential SEO Techniques for Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/openvidview-a-2024-innovation-no-price-tag/"><u>OpenVidView  A 2024 Innovation, No Price Tag</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-secrets-of-the-pros-screening-your-switch-games/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Secrets of the Pros  Screening Your Switch Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-use-allshare-cast-to-turn-on-screen-mirroring-on-realme-c67-5g-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Use Allshare Cast To Turn On Screen Mirroring On Realme C67 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-itel-p40-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Itel P40 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-7-color-match-paint-apps/"><u>Updated In 2024, Best 7 Color Match Paint Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-solutions-to-spy-on-samsung-galaxy-f15-5g-with-and-without-jailbreak-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Solutions to Spy on Samsung Galaxy F15 5G with and without jailbreak | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/viral-vignette-visor/"><u>Viral Vignette Visor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-the-secrets-of-instagrams-video-capsule-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking the Secrets of Instagram's Video Capsule for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/wondering-the-best-alternative-to-hola-on-nubia-red-magic-9-pro-here-is-the-answer-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Wondering the Best Alternative to Hola On Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro?

Post YouTube Videos Consistently"></a>1. Post YouTube Videos Consistently</h2><p>In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html" >keep posting constantly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.</p><h2 id="2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video"><a href="#2-Provide-Value-in-Each-Video" class="headerlink" title="2. Provide Value in Each Video"></a>2. Provide Value in Each Video</h2><p>Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.</p><h2 id="3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’"><a href="#3-Ask-Viewers-to-Subscribe-with-a-‘CTA’" class="headerlink" title="3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’"></a>3. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a ‘CTA’</h2><p>Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >call to action <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.</p><p>One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html" >brand-new viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.</p><h2 id="4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community"><a href="#4-Spend-Time-Building-your-YouTube-Community" class="headerlink" title="4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community"></a>4. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community</h2><p>YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html" >gain support for your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.</p><p>Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >appear in one of their videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.</p><h2 id="5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them"><a href="#5-Set-YouTube-Goals-and-Announce-Them" class="headerlink" title="5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them"></a>5. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them</h2><p>Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.</p><p>Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos"><a href="#6-Find-a-Niche-for-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="6. Find a Niche for Your Videos"></a>6. Find a Niche for Your Videos</h2><p>Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html" >niches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.</p><p>Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.</p><h2 id="7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand"><a href="#7-Build-a-Strong-Personal-Brand" class="headerlink" title="7. Build a Strong Personal Brand"></a>7. Build a Strong Personal Brand</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html" >Building a brand on YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html" >channel art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.</p><p>Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.</p><h2 id="8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art"><a href="#8-Create-Custom-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="8. Create Custom Channel Art"></a>8. Create Custom Channel Art</h2><p>To differentiate yourself from your competition you’re going to need to have <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html" >custom Channel Art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.</p><h2 id="9-Practice-Makes-Perfect"><a href="#9-Practice-Makes-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="9. Practice Makes Perfect"></a>9. Practice Makes Perfect</h2><p>In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.</p><p>Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you’re working with will<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html" >save you time when you’re actually polishing a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.</p><p>Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.</p><h2 id="10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video"><a href="#10-Add-a-YouTube-Intro-Video" class="headerlink" title="10. Add a YouTube Intro Video"></a>10. Add a YouTube Intro Video</h2><p>A professional-looking intro clip (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >learn how to make one here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions"><a href="#11-Use-Video-Effects-and-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="11. Use Video Effects and Transitions"></a>11. Use Video Effects and Transitions</h2><p>Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.</p><p>Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.</p><p>It can take some time to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html" >add these kinds of effects to your videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.</p><h2 id="12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails"><a href="#12-Make-Eye-Catching-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails"></a>12. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails</h2><p>A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html" >or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).</p><h2 id="13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags"><a href="#13-Use-Lots-of-YouTube-Tags" class="headerlink" title="13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags"></a>13. Use Lots of YouTube Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >Tags should include keywords&#x2F;search terms <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.</p><p>Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords&#x2F;tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.</p><h2 id="14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time"><a href="#14-Use-YouTube-Playlists-to-Increase-Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time"></a>14. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it’s much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.</p><p>Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.</p><h2 id="15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media"><a href="#15-Promote-Your-YouTube-Channel-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media"></a>15. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media</h2><p>Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html" >the promotion that you do through social media <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="16-Interact-with-your-Viewers"><a href="#16-Interact-with-your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="16. Interact with your Viewers"></a>16. Interact with your Viewers</h2><p>Spending time <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-youtube-audience-283.html" >interacting with your viewers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> via comments and social media is important. Taking suggestions and paying attention to what your viewers like most about your videos will make your viewers feel more included in the process of creating your videos. This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&amp;A videos.</p><h2 id="17-Check-Out-the-Big-Channels-in-Your-Genre"><a href="#17-Check-Out-the-Big-Channels-in-Your-Genre" class="headerlink" title="17.

Check Out the Big Channels in Your Genre</h2><p>Spending time <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/your-youtube-rivals---how-to-get-more-views-by-checking-out-the-competition-62.html" >examining your competition <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is very important. By looking at the popular channels in your genre you can learn what kinds of videos are popular and what types of video titles and tags you should be using.</p><h2 id="18-Do-Collaboration-Videos"><a href="#18-Do-Collaboration-Videos" class="headerlink" title="18. Do Collaboration Videos"></a>18. Do Collaboration Videos</h2><p>When you <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html" >collaborate with other YouTube creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it leads to mutual success. You can cross-promote some of their content and they can promote some of your content in the process. It’s amazing how much your channel can grow when you’re exposed to other people’s audiences. Even if you might view another content creator is your competition, sometimes uniting together on a project can help you to mutually prosper.</p><p>Make sure your potential partner makes the kinds of videos your own audience would like. Then you’ll know that your videos are something your partner’s audience will like.</p><h2 id="19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video"><a href="#19-Write-a-Detailed-Description-for-Every-Video" class="headerlink" title="19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video"></a>19. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video</h2><p>The description box is one of the most commonly underutilized tools on YouTube. Make sure that you use the space to write a full description of each video. In the first three lines of every video description, use the keywords most relevant to your content, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Lower down in your description, under the ‘read more’ tab, write a detailed summary of your video. This will improve your SEO&#x2F;search engine optimization.</p><h2 id="20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable"><a href="#20-Use-Keywords-That-Are-Searchable" class="headerlink" title="20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable"></a>20. Use Keywords That Are Searchable</h2><p>In your titles, descriptions, and tags you need to use the words or phrases that viewers are most likely to type into YouTube’s search bar when looking for content like yours. Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.</p><p>For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.</p><p> <em>Contest now closed.</em></p><h2 id="21-Make-your-Thumbnails-Consistent"><a href="#21-Make-your-Thumbnails-Consistent" class="headerlink" title="21. Make your Thumbnails Consistent"></a>21. Make your Thumbnails Consistent</h2><p>The thumbnails that you choose for your videos can be an extension of your brand. By using similar layouts, colors, and fonts for every thumbnail you will <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-video-thumbnails-for-youtube-288.html" >create a familiar look <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and viewers will recognize your videos when they see them. If someone can instantly recognize your video thumbnails it will strengthen your brand and encourage repeat viewership.</p><h2 id="22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos"><a href="#22-Always-Have-a-Plan-for-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos"></a>22. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos</h2><p>If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.</p><h2 id="23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views"><a href="#23-Make-Titles-that-Get-Views" class="headerlink" title="23. Make Titles that Get Views"></a>23. Make Titles that Get Views</h2><p>Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.</p><h2 id="24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer"><a href="#24-Create-a-YouTube-Channel-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer"></a>24. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer</h2><p>Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe. YouTube allows you to set a featured video that will autoplay in this space, and a lot of the most successful creators use this as an opportunity to post a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Your channel trailer welcomes new viewers and tells them what to expect from your content.</p><p>You can create a trailer quickly by filming a quick introduction and combining it with clips from your previous videos.</p><h2 id="25-Give-Each-of-Your-Videos-a-Memorable-Ending"><a href="#25-Give-Each-of-Your-Videos-a-Memorable-Ending" class="headerlink" title="25.

Having entertaining and&#x2F;or informative content is the most important thing, but making great videos can only get you so far if people never get a chance to watch them. There are strategies you can use to make sure people get a chance to watch your videos in the first place.</p><p>In this article, we will let you know how to get more views on <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-for-Getting-More-Views-on-YouTube"><a href="#10-Tips-for-Getting-More-Views-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips for Getting More Views on YouTube"></a>10 Tips for Getting More Views on YouTube</h2><h3 id="1-Be-Searchable"><a href="#1-Be-Searchable" class="headerlink" title="1. Be Searchable"></a>1. Be Searchable</h3><p>A big part of how to get views on YouTube is making sure people get a chance to watch your videos. People cannot click on something that does not come up in their search results. If you want people to get the chance to see your vlog you need to tailor the titles, descriptions, and tags of your videos so that they come up in searches.</p><p>A good way to start is to do a search for your topic and check out how videos that come up first are tagged. This will give you a sense for what keywords you should try to incorporate. For a more in-depth explanation of how you can use your titles, descriptions, and tags to get more views read ‘How To Upload Videos to YouTube’ and watch Tasha’s video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-views01.jpg"                      alt="be searchable"                ></p><h3 id="2-Link-Yourself"><a href="#2-Link-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Link Yourself"></a>2. Link Yourself</h3><p>If somebody is watching your video and enjoying it then they will probably welcome the chance to check out similar content. At the end of your videos always include a link to one of your previous videos. If somebody has watched your video all the way through then they must have liked it, and there is a good chance they will click your link. You can use either YouTube Cards or annotations to redirect viewers to your other videos.</p><p>You do not have to limit yourself to providing links only at the ends of your videos, but you should never include more than three total links in one video. If there are too many then people will start ignoring them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-views02.jpg"                      alt="link yourself"                ></p><h3 id="3-Make-Playlists"><a href="#3-Make-Playlists" class="headerlink" title="3. Make Playlists"></a>3. Make Playlists</h3><p>Playlists work for the same reason that linking to your other videos does. If somebody likes what they are watching they will probably like watching something similar. The great thing about playlists is that the viewer does not have to take action and click on another of your videos – one just automatically plays when their current video ends. People watching a video on a playlist are more likely to watch multiple videos from that playlist.</p><p>If one of your videos is ranked high on a YouTube search, and that video is also on a playlist, then your playlist will also come up in that same search. This will put your other videos in the path of potential viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/playlist-youtube.JPG"                      alt="playlist"                ></p><h3 id="4-Ask-and-You-Shall-Receive"><a href="#4-Ask-and-You-Shall-Receive" class="headerlink" title="4. Ask and You Shall Receive"></a>4. Ask and You Shall Receive</h3><p>If you can get more people to subscribe to your videos then you will see your view counts start to snowball. How do you get people to subscribe and share your videos? Ask them to.</p><p>People are more likely to subscribe or share if they are prompted to, so make sure to remind viewers to subscribe and share in every video. Consider putting a ‘subscribe’ button at the end of every video.</p><h3 id="5-Use-YouTube-Cards"><a href="#5-Use-YouTube-Cards" class="headerlink" title="5. Use YouTube Cards"></a>5. Use YouTube Cards</h3><p>The overlays that show up in the videos are the YouTube cards. In the overlays, you may add any link, call-to-action-button, image or a title that can explain the content of your video or help in sales.</p><p>For instance, when you create a video series, YouTube card helps your viewers to get to the webpage directly when you mention the link on the card or find and watch the following video in the sequence easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-youtube-annotations-and-cards.jpg"                      alt="youtube cards"                ></p><h3 id="6-End-Screens-Is-Useful"><a href="#6-End-Screens-Is-Useful" class="headerlink" title="6. End Screens Is Useful"></a>6. End Screens Is Useful</h3><p>The YouTube end screens are one of the best ways to get YouTube views. It offers several options to your viewers through the Call-to-Action button when you create your brand. You may consider inviting your audiences to subscribe and suggest a few videos that they may like from your channel.</p><p>The end screens appear at the last 20 seconds of your video and up to 4 elements can be added to each of it. You may also add your landing page’s link in the ens screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-end-screen.JPG"                      alt="end screen"                ></p><h3 id="7-Optimize-Thumbnail"><a href="#7-Optimize-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="7. Optimize Thumbnail"></a>7. Optimize Thumbnail</h3><p>In order to get more views on YouTube, the thumbnail image optimization can play a big role.</p><p>For instance, a celebrity or superhero image can prove to be beneficial when displayed in the suggested videos section, organic search results page or while you share on the social media.</p><p>It is highly recommended that only high-quality images must be used. The image must feature clear, comprehensible, and attractive fonts with facial-closeups.</p><p>But, you may use it only if they’re included in your video. The image thumbnail must relate to the description and title you used for the video to boost its value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="thumbnail"                ></p><h3 id="8-Provide-Value"><a href="#8-Provide-Value" class="headerlink" title="8. Provide Value"></a>8. Provide Value</h3><p>To get more views on YouTube, the content you offer must be valuable. It must either help people to learn something like how-to videos or keep people entertained and engaged. When you offer valuable content, people get back to you for more and also help in increasing views in your future videos.</p><h3 id="9-Interact-With-Your-Viewers"><a href="#9-Interact-With-Your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="9. Interact With Your Viewers"></a>9. Interact With Your Viewers</h3><p>Without the viewers, it is not possible to get YouTube views so keeping your viewers in the loop is an ideal way to get more views on YouTube.</p><p>For instance, when a viewer leaves a comment on your video, it may be a positive or a negative one, try to respond in a much detailed manner without ignoring the comment. When you be a part of your viewer’s community and engage in their discussion, it shows you care for them and think about their success.</p><p>You may try to know if your content is helping them out and in return, they might remember your generosity and view more of your content in future. Do not be too pushy, just share your views or products and content.</p><h3 id="10-Use-Youtube-Analytics-Properly"><a href="#10-Use-Youtube-Analytics-Properly" class="headerlink" title="10. Use Youtube Analytics Properly"></a>10. Use Youtube Analytics Properly</h3><p>To achieve success, it is essential to experiment, track the results, and make necessary changes as per requirement.</p><p>The YouTube Analytics helps to check the videos that performed best, the engagement of the viewers, and your audience’s demographics as well. With a detailed report, you can make necessary changes to your strategy that can help you to get more views on youtube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics.JPG"                      alt="youtube analytics"                ></p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Video Optimization [Free Checklist] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Loop a YouTube Video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using the strategies explained above you do not need to leave the success of your videos up to chance. It is often completely random which YouTube videos go viral, but you can have a lot of influence over how many views you get. Support your own content through links, playlists, and in video promotion. Also, make sure your titles, descriptions, and tags are optimized for YouTube searches. These are great methods for getting more views on YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-comprehensive-list-of-8-authentic-propagation-tools/"><u>2024 Approved  A Comprehensive List of 8 Authentic Propagation Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-content-creators-earnings-timeline-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, Content Creators’ Earnings Timeline on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/choosing-free-video-editing-software-on-iphone-and-ipad/"><u>Choosing Free Video Editing Software on iPhone & iPad</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-capture-clarity-high-quality-screen-recordings-for-youtubers-pcmac/"><u>In 2024, Capture Clarity  High-Quality Screen Recordings for YouTubers (PC/Mac)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-edit-youtube-videos-in-finalcut-pro/"><u>In 2024, How to Edit YouTube Videos in Finalcut Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/accelerated-pathway-through-keying-fundamentals/"><u>Accelerated Pathway Through Keying Fundamentals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/achieve-perfect-youtube-broadcasts-with-superior-webcams/"><u>Achieve Perfect YouTube Broadcasts with Superior Webcams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-stepwise-approach-to-designing-powerful-edu-vids-on-social-media/"><u>2024 Approved  A Stepwise Approach to Designing Powerful Edu-Vids on Social Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-use-phone-clone-to-migrate-your-motorola-moto-g04-data-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Use Phone Clone to Migrate Your Motorola Moto G04 Data? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-bites-and-bloopers-tasty-talents-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] In 2024, Bites & Bloopers  Tasty Talents on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-secure-youtube-channels-audible-content/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Secure YouTube Channels' Audible Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-capture-clarity-enjoy-convenience-with-our-top-5-recorder-recommendations/"><u>In 2024, Capture Clarity, Enjoy Convenience with Our Top 5 Recorder Recommendations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-vimeo-demystified-for-passionate-creators-and-viewers/"><u>In 2024, Vimeo Demystified  For Passionate Creators & Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensive-solution-for-srt-not-working-in-premiere/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensive Solution for SRT Not Working in Premiere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/top-strategies-for-changing-song-pace-on-spotify-app-for-2024/"><u>Top Strategies for Changing Song Pace on Spotify App for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-catch-the-regional-located-pokemon-for-realme-11x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Catch the Regional-Located Pokemon For Realme 11X 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigate-away-from-bot-influenced-metrics/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigate Away From Bot-Influenced Metrics</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

The mic’s source of power"></a>1. The mic’s source of power</h3><p>A microphone can draw power from two sources, as you can either connect it to a computer via a USB cable or you can use an XLR cable to connect the device to an external power source.</p><p>The so-called Phantom Power can be any type of adapter or audio recorder that supplies a microphone with power. All professional condenser microphones are connected to a power source through an XLR connection although some mics can have a built-in phantom power source that requires only an AA battery to function normally.</p><h3 id="2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction"><a href="#2-The-microphone’s-recording-direction" class="headerlink" title="2.

The level of self-noise a microphone makes"></a>3. The level of self-noise a microphone makes</h3><p>Recording low sounds can be challenging if your microphone is creating humming or crackling noises automatically. The so-called self-noise level a microphone makes is quantified in A-weighted decibels, and ideally, you should get a mic that makes around 15dBA in order to keep sounds a microphone produces automatically at the very minimum.</p><p>Besides the self-noise, you should also look into S&#x2F;N (Signal to Noise Ratio) that depicts the ratio of signal power to noise power. A mic that has approximately 80dBA or more should enable you to record low voices without having to worry about the unwanted noises.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-The-Best-Budget-ASMR-Microphones-for-Beginners"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-The-Best-Budget-ASMR-Microphones-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are The Best Budget ASMR Microphones for Beginners?"></a>Part 2: What Are The Best Budget ASMR Microphones for Beginners?</h2><p>If you are thinking about starting an ASMR YouTube channel, you don’t have to get a professional microphone right away, because there lots of affordable mics that will enable you to create crystal-clear audio recordings.</p><p>We’ve shortlisted a few of the best budget ASMR microphones for beginners on the market with the aim to help you narrow down your choices.

If you are on a budget, then a microphone like Blue Yeti may be a great choice, because it lets you choose between different polar patterns and it produces a great quality of sound.</p><p>On the other hand, 3Dio FS Pro II or Rode NT1-A Stereo microphones are worth investing in because they will enable you to record sound at a professional level.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/supercharge-your-content-editing-and-enhancing-youtube-tags/"><u>Supercharge Your Content  Editing and Enhancing YouTube Tags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/elevate-your-brand-with-these-biz-channel-standouts-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Your Brand with These Biz Channel Standouts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/the-powerhouses-unveiling-top-10-most-subscribed-youtube-stars/"><u>The Powerhouses  Unveiling Top 10 Most Subscribed YouTube Stars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-cerebral-channels-top-educational-yt-networks/"><u>[New] Cerebral Channels  Top Educational YT Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/unlock-google-meets-potential-on-youtube-with-this-guide/"><u>Unlock Google Meet's Potential on YouTube with This Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-building-your-youtube-empire-kit-overview/"><u>[New] Building Your YouTube Empire  Kit Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-educator-elite-selective-learning-yt-channels/"><u>[Updated] Educator Elite  Selective Learning YT Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/crafting-fast-fortnite-icons-in-minutes-for-2024/"><u>Crafting Fast Fortnite Icons in Minutes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/from-dorm-room-to-mainstream-trending-short-hashtags/"><u>From Dorm Room to Mainstream  Trending Short Hashtags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-airplane-mode-turn-off-gps-location-on-zte-axon-40-lite-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Does Airplane Mode Turn off GPS Location On ZTE Axon 40 Lite? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/bridging-the-gap-from-rgb-to-standardized-srgb/"><u>Bridging the Gap  From Rgb to Standardized Srgb</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/what-are-location-permissions-life360-on-vivo-v30-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What are Location Permissions Life360 On Vivo V30? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/top-10-free-online-animated-logo-makers-everyone-should-know/"><u>Top 10 Free Online Animated Logo Makers Everyone Should Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-windows-best-chat-tools-ranked-3-1/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Windows' Best Chat Tools  Ranked #3-#1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-ways-to-transfer-music-from-vivo-y100-5g-to-other-android-devices-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Ways to Transfer Music from Vivo Y100 5G to Other Android Devices Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Apple iPhone 6? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-digital-music-layering-and-editing-suite-for-2024/"><u>Updated Digital Music Layering & Editing Suite for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/revolutionary-top-8-methods-convert-subtitles-to-srt-format-seamlessly/"><u>Revolutionary Top 8 Methods  Convert Subtitles to SRT Format Seamlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023)? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Times them to music</li><li>Guides you with pop-up tips</li><li>No text&#x2F;title overlays</li><li>Exports directly to YouTube</li></ol><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a professional-grade desktop editor, and Adobe Premiere Clip lives up to the quality standards set by its big-brother software. It is missing some features you might want for YouTube videos, like title effects, but it does have some bells and whistles. There’s a good selection of filters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-filters.jpg"                      alt="adobe premiere filters"                ></p><p>Making changes to your picture, like adjusting the exposure or the prevalence of highlights or shadows, is just a matter of sliding bars. The tools for splitting and duplicating clips are easy to find too. You just toggle between the two icons right above your video – the one that looks like a shutter and the one that looks like adjustment bars – to switch between the picture tools and the other tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-clip-options.jpg"                      alt="adobe premiere clip options"                ></p><p>You cannot add what you might normally think of as a title effect in Adobe Premiere Clip, so it’ll be hard to fully complete your video. You can add text cards to put in-between your video clips, but you can’t overlay the title on top of a clip.</p><p>You can share your video directly to YouTube when you export.</p><h2 id="Cameo"><a href="#Cameo" class="headerlink" title="Cameo"></a>Cameo</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-ios.jpg"                      alt="cameo ios"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Easy-to-apply themes</li><li>Customizable titles</li><li>Limited features</li><li>Exports to 4K (if your clips are 4K)</li></ol><p>Vimeo is a video sharing site with more of a ‘filmmaker’ focus than YouTube, so it isn’t a surprise that their mobile editing app Cameo can export high-quality 4K videos.</p><p>Like some of the other apps on this list, Cameo does not have a huge variety of functions. You can reorder your clips, trim them, add titles, and apply themes (essentially filter and title combos).</p><p>There are three icons on the main interface: Scissors, a Music Note, and Filters.</p><p>The Scissors will take you to the trimming screen, where you can make your clip shorter or longer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-interface.jpg"                      alt="cameo interface"                ></p><p>You can also add a title in the trimming screen, but you will not be able to change the font style or color until you are in the Filter screen.</p><p>In the Filter screen (tap the overlapping filters icon on the main interface) you will be able to adjust the color of your text by tapping on the circle with the A in it. Tapping where it says ‘Font’ will change your font style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-font.jpg"                      alt="cameo font"                ></p><p>You can also tap on Themes and choose a premade style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-crush-style.jpg"                      alt="cameo crush style"                ></p><p>Here’s what ‘Crush’ looks like applied:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cameo-crush-preview.jpg"                      alt="cameo crush preview"                ></p><p>My font was changed, and there’s also a filter now. In order to apply a filter, you must start with a theme.</p><h2 id="Clips"><a href="#Clips" class="headerlink" title="Clips"></a>Clips</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips-ios.jpg"                      alt="clips ios"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Great selection of stickers</li><li>Lacks some basic tools</li><li>Simple interface</li></ol><p>Clips is an intuitive app with a lot of options for decorating your videos. It is lacking in some of the more basic editings features you might expect (i.e. you cannot split clips or do any color correction), but it has a lot of fun features like stickers and emojis that could make up for that depending on your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips-stickers-emojis.jpg"                      alt="clips stickers&amp;emojis"                ></p><p>There are also more traditional effects, like filters and titles. There are a wide range of title options in styles that are popular on YouTube, and a fairly standard filter selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips-effects.jpg"                      alt="clips effects"                ></p><p>While you cannot split clips in this app, but trimming and reordering them is easy. For trimming, you just select the clip and then Trim to open a screen where you can drag the start and end points of the clip.</p><p>To rearrange your clips, just tap the clip you want to move and hold down. You’ll be able to drag it to a new location.</p><p>It’d be hard to rely on Clips exclusively as your YouTube video editor, but it’s well suited for Instagram or for making quick ‘on-the-go’ videos.</p><h2 id="Filmora-Android"><a href="#Filmora-Android" class="headerlink" title="Filmora ( Android"></a>Filmora ( <strong>Android</strong></h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Export directly to YouTube</li><li>16:9 or 1:1 for Instagram</li><li>Includes effects like transitions, filters, and overlays</li><li>End-roll logo</li></ol><p>You can make a complete video easily just by tapping and dragging in Filmora, and there are even effects like filters, transitions, and overlays you can add to make your video more polished.</p><p>After importing your media into Filmora (you can import videos and photos saved on your phone, or media which has been uploaded to a social media account like Facebook or Instagram) you can change the order of your clips by tapping one, pressing down for a moment, and then dragging your clips where you want them.</p><p>Trimming a clip is as simple as tapping on it and then Duration. You’ll get this screen where you can adjust the length easily by dragging the markers to beginning or endpoints.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go-trim-clip.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go Trim&amp;Clip"                ></p><p>Cropping and zooming are simple too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go-crop-zoom.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go Crop&amp;Zoom"                ></p><p>Filmora comes with pre-made themes you can apply which include titles, filters, and other effects. These might not be ideal if you already have branding you like to use for YouTube, but in some situations, they can make video creation a lot faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go-effects.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go Effects"                ></p><p>Filmora comes loaded with music, or you can even import your own music from your phone.</p><p>Once you’re done, tap ‘save’ in the top right corner of your screen to export your video. From the save screen, you’ll be able to export your video directly to YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-go-save-export.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Go Save&amp;Export"                ></p><p>One potential drawback is that Filmora will add its own logo to the end of your exported video. This logo will not distract from your video content since it is added at the end and never overlaps any of your clips, but it still might not be ideal for all creators.</p><h2 id="Funimate-Android"><a href="#Funimate-Android" class="headerlink" title="Funimate ( Android"></a>Funimate ( Android</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/funimate-android-ios.jpg"                      alt="Funimate"                ></p><p> <strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Easily add text and shapes</li><li>Rainbow doodling</li><li>Shake effects</li><li>Small ‘Funimate’ watermark in videos from the free version</li></ol><p>Funimate is lives up to the ‘fun’ promise in its name. It’s designed mostly for music videos&#x2F;Musical.ly and while it is missing a lot of more typical editing options, there are a few free tools in Funimate that other apps just don’t have.</p><p>For example, there are shake and distortion effects available through Funimate that you usually only find in desktop software.</p><p>You can also draw rainbow designs on your video with your finger – no other app on this list can do that.</p><p>The text tool in Funimate is easy to use, and there are cool looking glow effects you can apply in the color selection screen. Those options are also available when you’re adding shapes, likes stars and sparkles.</p><p>Funimate is not built for typical editing, which is both its strength and its weakness. Trimming your clips is its own stage which you must complete before you start adding effects, and you cannot split clips or add multiple clips.</p><p>The free version of Funimate does add a small watermark to your videos in the bottom-right corner, but it is subtle enough that I almost missed it completely while reviewing the app.</p><h2 id="iMovie"><a href="#iMovie" class="headerlink" title="iMovie"></a>iMovie</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-ios.jpg"                      alt="iMovie"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Trailer templates</li><li>Themes</li><li>Limited tools and resources</li></ol><p>iMovie’s mobile app is designed for ease and includes things like ‘trailer templates’ and themes that allow you to make a video quickly and with minimal effort.</p><p>This streamlined app is limited in its features. Other apps on this list have left out color correction tools or clip splitting tools and instead loaded up on decorative features like stickers, emojis, and overlays. iMovie has left out these tools and does not have an abundance of decorative features either.</p><p>There are filters, themes, and titles, however.</p><p>The titles are simple but polished, and you’ll find all the standard types of filters.</p><p>The themes include a variety of graphics and are applied to your entire video, not individual clips. You can also apply one filter to your entire video.</p><p>iMovie also includes a decent selection of transitions, which you can apply easily by tapping the area between two clips.</p><h2 id="Movie-Maker-Filmmaker-by-Alive-Android"><a href="#Movie-Maker-Filmmaker-by-Alive-Android" class="headerlink" title="Movie Maker Filmmaker by Alive ( Android"></a>Movie Maker Filmmaker by Alive ( Android</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movie-maker-filmmaker-alive.jpg"                      alt="Movie Maker Filmmaker by Alive"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Good title tool</li><li>Stickers</li><li>Change clip duration</li><li>16:9 or 1:1</li></ol><p>Movie Maker Filmmaker (the app will be labeled ‘Alive’ in on your phone) has a lot of features that will help you put together a fun YouTube video. There’s a great selection of stickers, filters, and overlays and they’re all easy to apply. You just click on what you want and resize&#x2F;reposition it in the player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movie-maker-filmmaker-filters.jpg"                      alt="Movie Maker Filmmaker Filters"                ></p><p>This app is missing a lot of basic editing features, however. You cannot adjust things like brightness or saturation. This won’t be a problem if you’re happy with your clips as-is, but it’s a bit odd to not have those options.</p><p>There is a text tool and while it is fairly basic, it is also flexible. There is a good selection of fonts to choose from, and you can also choose whether or not you want a colored background, and if your text should have a shadow.</p><p>Once you’ve decided on the look of your text you can drag it, resize it, and tilt it however you want in the preview screen.</p><p>A slightly odd feature of this app is that it doesn’t save your video to your phone or export it directly to YouTube. Instead, it saves it – and shares it – within the app and gives you the option of sharing it with YouTube after.</p><h2 id="Power-Director"><a href="#Power-Director" class="headerlink" title="Power Director"></a>Power Director</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/power-director-android.jpg"                      alt="Power Director"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>A timeline like desktop software</li><li>All the basic editing features</li><li>Lots of transitions</li><li>Videos from the free version will be watermarked</li></ol><p>The first thing you’ll notice when you open up Power Director is that the interface looks a lot like the interface of a lot of desktop editors with a very classic timeline. This familiarity could make it easy to jump into if you’re used to editing on your laptop.</p><p>However, Power Director is a bit less intuitive than most of the other apps on this list. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s difficult to use – it isn’t, it’s much easier than a lot of desktop software – but among mobile apps designed for streamlined efficiency it does stand out as being a bit harder to dive into.</p><p>That is partly because there’s a lot you can do with it. It has the tools you would expect in an editor. You can split and trim clips, and you have all the standard color tools including some that most mobile apps leave out.</p><p>A lot of apps have Brightness, Contrast, and Saturation, but PowerDirector also has Color Temperature and Tint.</p><p>In addition to editing tools, PowerDirector has bells and whistles like filters –</p><p>- and a ton of great transitions.</p><p>One drawback of PowerDirector is that the free version will watermark your videos. This watermark is not intrusive, but it isn’t as subtle as the Funimate one either.</p><p>You can export videos from PowerDirector directly to YouTube.</p><h2 id="Vlogit-Android"><a href="#Vlogit-Android" class="headerlink" title="Vlogit ( Android"></a>Vlogit ( Android</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogit-android-ios.jpg"                      alt="Vlogit"                ></p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ol><li>Easy thumbnail maker</li><li>Export directly to YouTube</li><li>Animated stickers</li></ol><p>Vlogit is also an app from the creators of the Filmora Video Editor. It isn’t quite as intuitive as Filmora, but the major benefit of Vlogit for YouTube creators is that it was designed with you in mind. It has features like animated stickers, emojis, and a thumbnail maker which were included specifically because YouTubers and vloggers need them.</p><p>All the usual adjustments you might want to make, like saturation or sharpness, are easy in Vlogit. So are adjustments to the length or crop of clips.</p><p>After you save your video you’ll have the option of creating a thumbnail using a screenshot from your video. You can add a colored border, text, emojis, and more!</p><p>Once you’re done, you can export directly to YouTube. Like Filmora, Vlogit does have a post-video logo roll.</p><p> Have you ever used a free mobile app to edit one of your YouTube videos?

All the plans give you ad-free and uninterrupted streaming experience.</p><p>Note: The price of the plans may vary depending on the region of your residence and Google policies. Nevertheless, no annual subscription is available at the time of this writing, and the amount is deducted from your account on monthly basis.</p><p>While each plan has its own merits and demerits, the most used one is Individual that also gives free access to YouTube Music, an app that is available for Android and iOS devices, and is specifically dedicated to the music where you can watch and listen to your favorite tracks published on the platform.</p><p>What makes YouTube Music popular among the premium subscribers is its ability to play the music even when the app is not active and&#x2F;or when the phone screen is turned off. Furthermore, you can even configure the app to play the audio without video, thus significantly reducing the battery consumption.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Unlike the YouTube main app itself, YouTube Music is limited only to the music, and cannot play other videos.</p><p>Once you have subscribed for the YouTube Premium Individual plan, and downloaded and installed the YouTube Music app, you can follow the instructions given below to <strong>play YouTube in background Android or iPhone</strong> smartphone.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Launch-YouTube-Music-and-Start-Streaming"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-YouTube-Music-and-Start-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Launch YouTube Music and Start Streaming"></a>Step 1: Launch YouTube Music and Start Streaming</h3><p>Launch <strong>YouTube Music</strong>, search for your favorite music using the <strong>Search</strong> icon at the top-right corner, tap the song in the suggestions list, and then tap the name of the track to start playing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-premium-play-music-background.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Premium Play Music background"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Switch-to-Audio-Only-Optional"><a href="#Step-2-Switch-to-Audio-Only-Optional" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Switch to Audio Only (Optional)"></a>Step 2: Switch to Audio Only (Optional)</h3><p>Tap anywhere on the video player window, and tap <strong>Audio</strong> from the top of the screen to switch to the audio only mode where the video of the song won’t be played.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Play-YouTube-in-Background"><a href="#Step-3-Play-YouTube-in-Background" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Play YouTube in Background"></a>Step 3: Play YouTube in Background</h3><p>Use your phone-specific button or option to minimize YouTube Music.

One of the easiest methods among them is explained below:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Play-YouTube-Video-on-Browser"><a href="#Step-1-Play-YouTube-Video-on-Browser" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Play YouTube Video on Browser"></a>Step 1: Play YouTube Video on Browser</h3><p>Launch Safari on your iPhone, and go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"><strong>www.youtube.com</strong></a> (important). Make sure to type the URL in the address bar so the YouTube app doesn’t start, and you can access YouTube from within the browser window itself.</p><p>Use the regular method to search for the video you want to play in the background, and tap the <strong>Play</strong> button to start streaming.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Open-a-New-Tab"><a href="#Step-2-Open-a-New-Tab" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Open a New Tab"></a>Step 2: Open a New Tab</h3><p>Tap the <strong>All Tabs</strong> icon from the bottom-right corner of the browser, and tap <strong>+</strong> from the bottom-center.

Some of the most used programs are listed below:</p><h3 id="VLC-for-Android"><a href="#VLC-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="VLC for Android"></a>VLC for Android</h3><p>Being one of the most versatile media playing software, VLC needs no introduction, and icing on the cake was added when the program was made available on Google Play Store.

While many of them use the platform to learn new skills through the tutorials that are available for free, others love the idea of having unlimited and unrestricted access to the gigantic database of music videos that they can dig in to find and play their favorite tracks. For the latter scenario, the processes explained above are likely to come in handy in order to <strong>play YouTube in background</strong> so the users can take full advantage of their iPhone or Android smartphone in case they only want to listen to the audio, and are not interested in watching the video while streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/crafting-powerful-video-titles-and-sizes/"><u>Crafting Powerful Video Titles & Sizes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-channel-trailers-that-convert-viewers-into-customers/"><u>2024 Approved  Channel Trailers that Convert Viewers Into Customers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-collaborate-for-success-video-strategies/"><u>[Updated] Collaborate for Success  Video Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-boost-your-channels-following-by-a-thousand/"><u>2024 Approved  Boost Your Channels' Following by a Thousand</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/the-complete-playbook-for-broadcasting-spherical-content-on-youtube/"><u>The Complete Playbook for Broadcasting Spherical Content on Youtube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-list-of-no-cost-sound-sites-for-filmmakers/"><u>The Ultimate List of No-Cost Sound Sites for Filmmakers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/churning-charts-todays-1-backdrop-music-for-youtube-shorts/"><u>Churning Charts  Today's #1 Backdrop Music for YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/building-a-custom-link-for-youtubes-auto-subscribe/"><u>Building a Custom Link for YouTube's Auto-Subscribe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-customizing-youtubes-direct-subscribe-link/"><u>[Updated] Customizing YouTube's Direct Subscribe Link</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/end-credits-designed-for-you-free-top-6-suggestions-for-2024/"><u>End Credits Designed for You  Free Top 6 Suggestions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-affordable-gear-for-aspiring-content-creators-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Affordable Gear for Aspiring Content Creators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-prioritize-quality-and-ease-the-top-12-videophones/"><u>[New] Prioritize Quality and Ease  The Top 12 Videophones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-enhancing-roku-experience-for-facebook-live-broadcasts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Enhancing Roku Experience for Facebook Live Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/can-i-bypass-a-forgotten-phone-password-of-oppo-a1-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>Can I Bypass a Forgotten Phone Password Of Oppo A1 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/top-13-easy-to-master-revenue-strategies-on-reddit/"><u>Top 13 Easy-to-Master Revenue Strategies on Reddit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-6-with-an-apple-watch-and-what-to-do-if-it-doesnt-work-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 6 With an Apple Watch & What to Do if It Doesnt Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/new-slow-down-speed-up-advanced-timeline-control-in-fcpx/"><u>New Slow Down, Speed Up Advanced Timeline Control in FCPX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-record-gameplay-in-samsung-galaxy-phones/"><u>In 2024, Record Gameplay in Samsung Galaxy Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-shooting-gear-top-10-cameras-without-jitters/"><u>In 2024, Best Shooting Gear  Top 10 Cameras Without Jitters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mobile-3d-animation-made-easy-top-apps-for-android-and-iphone/"><u>Updated In 2024, Mobile 3D Animation Made Easy Top Apps for Android & iPhone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

All the uploads that the user has made before are added to the YouTube Video Editor. The tool allows the user to combine, trim, add music and customize. However, its functionality is limited to just that, and that’s why people are looking for the best YouTube Video Editor alternative.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite. Check the best <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editor alternatives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from this complete guide.</p><p>Some of the cons of the YouTube Video Editor are:</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced editing features.</li><li>It requires Internet connection to use.</li><li>It is slow.</li><li>Users can only edit videos that were already uploaded to their YouTube account.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-5-YouTube-Video-Editor-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-YouTube-Video-Editor-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives"></a>Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives</h2><p>The good news is that there are good offline YouTube Video Editor Alternatives out there. Below are the top five:</p><h4 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.  Wondershare Filmora"></a>1.  Wondershare Filmora</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the most popular YouTube Video Editor alternatives. It is available for both Windows and Mac platforms. The best thing about Wondershare Filmora is that it is easy to use. And at the same time, it has more features than the YouTube Video Editor.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>Some of the key features of Filmora include:</p><ul><li>Allows the user to crop, cut, and combine video clips in just a few clicks</li><li>Supports the addition of multiple audio and video tracks</li><li>Choose from various overlays and filters</li><li>Supports face off, green screen, and PIP effects</li><li>Supports a wide range of video formats that include MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and WMV, just to name a few</li><li>Burn video to DVD, or instantly upload it to YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo</li></ul><h4 id="2-WeVideo"><a href="#2-WeVideo" class="headerlink" title="2.  WeVideo"></a>2.  WeVideo</h4><p>Another YouTube Video Editor alternative is <a class="link"   href="https://www.wevideo.com/" >WeVideo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It is a cloud-based video editor that allows the user to do the editing in any web browser. Just like the YouTube editing tool, the user must first upload the clips online in order to edit them, and create a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bdayvideo-wevideo.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>One advantage of WeVideo is that it allows different users to collaborate in making a single video. A user can invite others to upload clips to the project, or even make different videos based on the same clips.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>And because it is a cloud-based video editor, it requires an Internet connection in order to get the clips and do the editing. Not only that, the videos must be uploaded before they can be used. And there are cases in which a five-minute video will require hours of raw footages. Users with slow upload speeds will take hours before they can start editing. And users of the free version can only export 480p videos that have a watermark. Users need to pay for the full version.</p><h4 id="3-Loopster"><a href="#3-Loopster" class="headerlink" title="3. Loopster"></a>3. Loopster</h4><p><a class="link"   href="http://www.loopster.com/" >Loopster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a mobile app that can be a YouTube Video Editor alternative. It is available for both the Android and iOS platforms. The tool allows the user to rotate, splice and add sound effects, zoom, and crop videos directly from one’s smartphone. It comes with advanced features that include title screens, slow motion effect, and bubble text. The app also lets the user record video and sounds directly. After editing the video, the app can export it directly to Facebook or YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loopster.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>It does what it was designed to do when it is working. It is user-friendly and comes with a tutorial. It also works even if the smartphone is not connected to the internet. Editing is done offline. And best of all, it is free.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>One the downside, it looks like the developer is no longer updating the app. Some users experience crashes and other bugs. There are also some users that stated that the slow motion effect didn’t work for them, which is why they can’t recommend it as a YouTube Video Editor alternative.</p><h4 id="4-Tubechop"><a href="#4-Tubechop" class="headerlink" title="4. Tubechop"></a>4. Tubechop</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.tubechop.com/" >Tubechop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows the user to trim a video from any YouTube video and then share it. There are some videos that are just too long, and you want to cut it to the section that you find interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubechop.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>Just like the other YouTube Video Editor alternatives, Tubechop is easy to use. The user just needs to enter the YouTube URL of the video, and then indicate the section that’s interesting, and that’s it.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>However, Tubechop doesn’t allow users to download the resulting video. Tubechop only provides a link that allows users to view the chopped video. And when the original video is deleted, the chopped version will also be deleted.</p><h4 id="5-Viddyad"><a href="#5-Viddyad" class="headerlink" title="5. Viddyad"></a>5. Viddyad</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://viddyad.com/" >Viddyad <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another cloud-based platform that lets users convert images, music, clips, and animated effects into a video. It is said to be the best way to create video ads for businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/viddyad.jpg"                                     ></p><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><p>There are several templates to choose from. Users can create video ads by adding videos, text, voiceover, special effects, music, and images. The platform also provides access to millions of image and video stock.</p><p> <strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>Viddyad is a YouTube Video Editor alternative for businesses that want to create video ads. It might not be the right video editor for individuals who just want to create and share their personal videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-amplify-impact-through-effective-video-marketing-on-youtubes-top-5-moves/"><u>In 2024, Amplify Impact Through Effective Video Marketing on YouTube's Top 5 Moves</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-affordable-and-effective-intros/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Affordable and Effective Intros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-channel-dynamo-craft-your-content-empire/"><u>In 2024, Channel Dynamo  Craft Your Content Empire</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-elevating-channel-excellence-with-ideas-and-vision/"><u>[New] Elevating Channel Excellence with Ideas & Vision</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/a-visual-voyage-through-youtubes-2017-data-deluge-for-2024/"><u>A Visual Voyage Through Youtube's 2017 Data Deluge for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/effortless-music-playlist-creation-for-youtube-anywhere-webmobile-for-2024/"><u>Effortless Music Playlist Creation for YouTube, Anywhere (Web/Mobile) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-your-vids-top-youtube-seo-gadgets/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Your Vids  Top YouTube SEO Gadgets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-set-up-iphone-xr-face-id-by-drfone-ios-unlock-ios-unlock/"><u>How to Set up iPhone XR Face ID?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/remove-samsung-lock-screen-without-password-samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-2023-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Remove Samsung Lock Screen without Password(Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023))</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-on-tecno-pova-6-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Is pgsharp legal when you are playing pokemon On Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-upgrade-or-downgrade-apple-iphone-6s-without-losing-anything-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Upgrade or Downgrade Apple iPhone 6s Without Losing Anything? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-does-rapid-subscription-improve-video-watching/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Does Rapid Subscription Improve Video Watching?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-complete-blueprint-incorporating-audio-in-kinemaster/"><u>Updated In 2024, The Complete Blueprint Incorporating Audio in KineMaster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-realme-narzo-n55s-potential-the-top-20-lock-screen-apps-you-need-to-try-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Realme Narzo N55s Potential The Top 20 Lock Screen Apps You Need to Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-transcribe-speech-to-text-in-microsoft-word-learn-it-here/"><u>[Updated] How to Transcribe Speech to Text in Microsoft Word  Learn It Here</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

In Filmora, you drag that alien effect into your PIP track and switch the green background to transparent.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Your alien buddy will be overlaid over your main clip, which will make it look like he is there with you.

Just go to the watch page for the video and type ‘ss’ in front of YouTube in the address bar (so your address looks like <strong><a class="link"   href="http://www.ssyoutube/" >http://www.ssyoutube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>). You will be taken to a page where you can download the video for free, so long as you don’t want it in HD. You have to pay for the service if you want a higher quality clip, but most of these green screen effects will look fine in 720p.</p><p>Have you made anything cool recently using a green screen?

Master Copy"></a>1. Master Copy</h4><p> Before exporting your work, it is important to first create a master copy of your project that is ‘as is’, in that it reflects the settings and codecs used in the original footage.</p><p> To do this you simply select the sequence within the Timeline or in the Project Panel, and go through the menu tree via <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Media</strong> to bring up the export dialogue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/exportdialogue.png"                      alt="exportdialogue"                ></p><p> To create your Master Copy, simply select the first option of ‘Match Sequence Settings’, this exports a file that is of the same quality as your original footage, essentially producing a digital copy of the work for archiving before anything else is done.</p><p> With you work safe and secure it is now time to look at ensuring the project is suitable for YouTube. With our sequence selected in the Timeline or Project Panel again, we go through the same <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Media</strong> path to bring up the media export dialogue as before.</p><h4 id="2-Container"><a href="#2-Container" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p> The first option we have to consider is the file format that our finished video needs to be in. Here you should refer to YouTube for its guidelines, whilst they do accept a number of file formats, digging through the YouTube help system to find the settings for highest quality we find that they recommend MPEG4 as the container, using the  codec.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/youtube-recommended-settings.png"                      alt="youtube-recommended-settings"                ></p><p> We can also see further recommended settings in this screenshot that will be covered later.</p><p> The good news is that Premiere automatically selects the appropriate container for us when we select our codec, however it is worth knowing the file type YouTube is expecting just to check yourself.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Codec"><a href="#3-Video-Codec" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Codec"></a>3. Video Codec</h4><p> So having established that YouTube recommends the MPEG4 container using the  codec, the first option we need to look for in the media export dialogue is to select the appropriate Format.</p><p> This is the first drop down in the dialogue box, and in this case we simply select  from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/choosing-format.png"                      alt="choosing-format"                ></p><p> Once you select  you can check the ‘output name’ field and see that premiere is automatically set the output file to .mp4 which is exactly what we need.</p><h4 id="4-Preset"><a href="#4-Preset" class="headerlink" title="4. Preset"></a>4. Preset</h4><p> The next field we come to is the ‘Preset’ dropdown menu. This is a major help to most people, as Adobe have very kindly included large numbers of presets to quickly adapt video settings to suit specific uses. They vary depending on the exact version of Premiere you are using, and each format type does have its own list of presets,  as we can see has a large number for YouTube, but also has many presets for specific devices (presets for iPad, Kindle, Nook, various other tablets and phones, Vimeo and a host of others) to make getting the right settings that bit easier for us.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/presets.png"                      alt="presets"                ></p><p> It is important here to select the correct preset from the various YouTube options. You want to select the resolution and frame rate that match your source file, for the best results. So, if your source file is 1080p with a frame rate of 29.97 fps then that is the YouTube setting you would select.</p><p> Once a preset is selected a summary of the settings is displayed below, normally these will be well suited to your project, however you can fine tune anything you wish by selecting the video or audio tabs at the bottom which give you the chance to adjust each parameter individually. If you do this, you can save these changes as a custom preset by clicking the button at the side of the Preset dropdown menu and simply use it on later projects by selecting it from the list the same as any other, a great time saving tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/finetuning.png"                      alt="finetuning"                ></p><h4 id="5-Rendering"><a href="#5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="5. Rendering"></a>5. Rendering</h4><p> Once you are satisfied with the settings, either from the Preset alone or if you have adjusted anything yourself, you are nearly ready to render the file and export it.</p><p> For YouTube it is recommended you select the ‘Use Maximum Render Quality’ option to maintain the best output you can, it does add time to the render process but if you value the quality of your work it is worthwhile.</p><p> Finally you can choose a suitable filename and the destination of the file by clicking on the ‘Output Name’ field.</p><p> I normally use a filename that includes the destination medium so I can differentiate between different versions of a project and know which one to upload where, in this case I include ‘youtube’, but if I were planning on uploading clips of the project to vimeo as well for instance there may be a cut of the project with ‘vimeo’ in the name too. The destination is personal preference, because I do use filenames to differentiate versions I can put the various iterations into a single project file, others have folder structures for each type of file , so all YouTube output goes into a single folder and so on, how you organize is entirely dependent on how you work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/filename.png"                      alt="filename"                ></p><p> Once those are selected clicking ‘Export’ starts the rendering process, and eventually (how long depends on the speed of your computer and the size and type of file involved), you will end up with your YouTube optimized video in the location you chose.</p><p> Here I created 4 key frames that let the ‘Animation’ object move around the ‘Demo Text’ Object and finally come to rest below it. Whilst this type of effect does look very effective on screen, such is the ease of use of After Effects it really is just a few minutes work to achieve.</p><p> Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text in Premiere &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-Uploading"><a href="#6-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="6. Uploading"></a>6. Uploading</h4><p> Now you have your file, the next step is to go to your YouTube account and log in if you need to.</p><p> On the top of your homepage on the right is the upload button, selecting that brings up the select file menu as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/upload-menu.png"                      alt="upload-menu"                ></p><p> You can either drag your file into the window or click on it to open a standard file browser to locate the desired file, click and the upload will begin. The dropdown underneath allows you to set the video as Public, Unlisted or Private. You can change this at any time once the video is uploaded as well.</p><p> This opens the upload progress window, where you can add in a name, description and tags as well as add the video to a playlist or adjust the privacy settings as the video is uploading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/upload-progress.png"                      alt="upload-progress"                ></p><p> Once the upload as finished, you can do final adjustments to settings and choose a thumbnail for the video. The final step is to click the ‘Publish’ button and your video will be processed and go live.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img

There are plenty of simple and completely free ways that you can gain more YouTube views and consistently see more traffic on every video that you produce.</p><p>Here are the top 12 ways that you can increase YouTube views on your videos:</p><ol><li><strong><a href="#one">Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#two">Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#three">Be a Part of the Community</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#four">Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#five">Optimizing Your Content for Keywords</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#six">Use Keywords in Your Video File Names</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#seven">Write Titles That Are Click-Worthy</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#eight">Use Lots of Tags</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#nine">Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#ten">Learn from the Success of Your Best Performing Videos</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#eleven">Embed Videos in Your Blog&#x2F;Website</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="#twelve">Share Your Videos on Social Media</a></strong></li></ol><h2 id="1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists"><a href="#1-Put-Your-Videos-in-YouTube-Playlists" class="headerlink" title="1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists"></a><strong>1. Put Your Videos in YouTube Playlists</strong></h2><p>YouTube playlists are an excellent way to chain together your video content and organize your channel, which will both translate into more views.</p><p>A quality playlist groups together several videos that are in some way similar. Think about the different ways you could sort your videos – by topic, by type, etc. – and make as many playlists as you can come up with. You can even reuse the same videos on multiple playlists where it makes sense. After you’re done, viewers who want to see all of you Call of Duty Let’s Plays or all of your makeup pallet reviews will be able to find them easily and will spend much more time watching your videos.</p><p>By creating a themed playlist of videos that will play one after another you increase the chances of your viewers sticking around to watch multiple videos. Making playlists helps you direct traffic from your more popular videos to the ones that haven’t gotten as many views, and it also helps drive up your watch time. Watch time is an important metric for YouTube’s search engine. When you increase your watch time, you can rank higher in search results and even get more views on YouTube.</p><h2 id="2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails"><a href="#2-Create-Custom-YouTube-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails"></a><strong>2. Create Custom YouTube Thumbnails</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >High-quality video thumbnails <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> play a major role in getting views for your YouTube videos. Spending a bit of time in Photoshop or a free online program like Canva on custom thumbnails for every video will help to boost YouTube views and earn you more clicks.</p><p>By having specialty thumbnails you will also have another type of content that is indexed by search engines. Every video you post will be searchable by not only text (your description) and video searches, but by image searches as well.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >For a list of YouTube thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="3-Be-a-Part-of-the-Community"><a href="#3-Be-a-Part-of-the-Community" class="headerlink" title="3. Be a Part of the Community"></a><strong>3. Be a Part of the Community</strong></h2><p>Regularly viewing videos from other channels within your genre, especially channels about the same size as yours, and taking the time to leave thoughtful comments can help to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >build your presence <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> within the online community. Other creators will notice you as you become a regular viewer and this will lead to them going to your channel and watching your videos (without you having to ask!).</p><p>You might even be able to create opportunities to collaborate with other creators by first becoming a fan of theirs. Collaboration videos allow you to cross-promote your content and attract new viewers and subscribers.</p><h2 id="4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends"><a href="#4-Tackle-the-Latest-YouTube-Trends" class="headerlink" title="4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends"></a><strong>4. Tackle the Latest YouTube Trends</strong></h2><p>New <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >trends are important to jump on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, especially when other YouTube creators are having success with videos on a particular set of trends. If there is a worldwide issue going on, a new and popular game, or a meme that everyone is making jokes about, you should consider making your own type of video related to that trend. Trending content almost always earns plenty of views because people search out content related to the trend they’re interested in. Covering a trend can bring in a whole new audience for your channel.</p><p>You can find trending topics to make videos on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or by checking out the popular channels in your genre to see if there’s a trend they’re all jumping on. When you cover a trend, always try to bring in your own original spin to stand out from the multitude of other videos covering the same trend.</p><h2 id="5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords"><a href="#5-Optimizing-your-Content-for-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords"></a><strong>5. Optimizing your Content for Keywords</strong></h2><p>Every piece of content that you produce for YouTube needs to be appropriately optimized with keywords. This means writing a full description that includes your 3 most important keywords in your first 3 lines, including a large number of appropriate tags and using your most important keyword in your title.</p><p>Do some keyword research to figure out what viewers who might enjoy your video will be typing into the search bar. You can start by searching for the topic of your video (i.e. ‘iPhone X review) and seeing what kinds of words are used in the titles and descriptions of the highest-ranked videos (or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check out these keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). You can even see the tags of other people’s videos using a free Chrome extension called VidIQ.</p><h2 id="6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names"><a href="#6-Use-Keywords-in-your-Video-File-Names" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names"></a><strong>6. Use Keywords in your Video File Names</strong></h2><p>A commonly overlooked area for optimization is the file names of YouTube videos. Many YouTube creators simply have generic filenames for all of the videos that they upload on the platform, such as ‘youtubevideo54.mp4’. Saving your files with names like this is actually a huge missed opportunity.</p><p>Consider renaming your video file to reflect your keyword-optimized video title. Including keywords within your file names will make sure that even the file itself will be indexed properly in a Google video search. This is a very quick, easy, way to increase your search ranking and get more views on YouTube.</p><h2 id="7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy"><a href="#7-Write-Titles-that-are-Click-Worthy" class="headerlink" title="7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy"></a><strong>7. Write Titles that are Click-Worthy</strong></h2><p>A title on a YouTube video needs to work just as effectively as any other headline on the internet. You need to be able to capture the attention of your audience and generate excitement while still using important keywords and letting your viewers know exactly what your video is about. Mysterious clickbait titles only work for channels that are already big.</p><p>Having the ability to write excellent titles that also carry keyword information that is relevant to your niche will take practice. In order for a title to be click-worthy, it needs to demonstrate a clear benefit for the viewer. A ‘clear benefit’ might be a skill the viewer will learn or information they will gain. Creating a sense of urgency in the title will also help to attract more clicks, and that can be done by using words like ‘now’ or ‘today’.</p><h2 id="8-Use-Lots-of-Tags"><a href="#8-Use-Lots-of-Tags" class="headerlink" title="8. Use Lots of Tags"></a><strong>8. Use Lots of Tags</strong></h2><p>Every YouTube user is limited to 426 characters for the total number of tags that they can include, and you should try to use as much of that space as you can. The more tags you use, the more potential searches YouTube might add your video to.</p><p>It’s important to have high converting tags that will generate a fair amount of viewership. By trying out a wide variety of tags related to your videos in the early days of your YouTube channel you will start to see which perform the best for you. You can then start making videos that target those tags in a more focused manner. As you start to do research into keywords and the types of tags that work best for your channel, you can eventually zero in on some of the best tags that you can use with all of your content moving forward.</p><h2 id="9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content"><a href="#9-Write-a-Thorough-Description-for-Every-Piece-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content"></a><strong>9. Write a Thorough Description for Every Piece of Content</strong></h2><p>The description that you post alongside your video is often one of the greatest ways that you can index your video in search engine results. Video content is starting to gain an extensive amount of traction especially when it comes to the way that it’s indexed in Google’s video search engine results. In order for your YouTube video to rank well within the search engine results, you need to have a thorough description.</p><p>A thorough description means doing keyword research as well as using the maximum number of characters that you can for the description. The largest YouTube descriptions that you might see are around 900 words. That means plenty of opportunities to use keywords within the content and help index the page in search engine results. Google will index the entire description just as it would any other webpage content so including a full transcription of your video or a detailed description of the content that’s in your video will help you to capture a huge audience and increase your YouTube views.</p><h2 id="10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos"><a href="#10-Learn-From-the-Success-of-Your-Best-Performing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos"></a><strong>10. Learn From the Success of Your Best Performing Videos</strong></h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Checking the analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of your channel regularly is important for creators both big and small. The analytics in your Creator Studio can tell you who’s watching your videos, which videos have the best watch time, and even which videos attract the newest subscribers.</p><p>When you know which videos are the most successful at getting people to subscribe, you can figure out why (perhaps it was the way you asked?) and replicate that method in your future videos. This will earn you more views over time because subscribers will watch more of your content.</p><p>You should also try to replicate the methods you used to get higher watch times in the videos that perform well in that regard. Improving your watch time will get you higher search engine rankings and more views.</p><h2 id="11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website"><a href="#11-Embed-Videos-in-your-Blog-Website" class="headerlink" title="11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website"></a><strong>11. Embed Videos in your Blog&#x2F;Website</strong></h2><p>Starting your own personal blog or website and embedding your videos within text posts is a great way to get more views. Views gathered outside of YouTube count too, and creating a web page means that there’s one more way for people to find your content in their search results.</p><p>If you do not have a blog and do not want to start one, consider whether you can get your videos embedded on someone else’s website or blog. It’s easiest to ask a friend, but you could also try to reach out to a blogger in your niche who doesn’t have their own YouTube channel. Explain that having a video embedded in their post might be useful for their readers, and can help to boost their session time which will be good for their search engine rankings.</p><h2 id="12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media"><a href="#12-Share-your-Videos-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="12. Share your Videos on Social Media"></a><strong>12. Share your Videos on Social Media</strong></h2><p>The YouTube community is quite a large one on its own but it doesn’t hurt to extend your social reach by <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >starting social media pages for your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well. Having an official Twitter or Instagram that is connected to your YouTube account can really help you to share your videos with a wider audience and ensure that you can capture views from many different sources at once.</p><p>Social media accounts also help you hold your subscribers’ attention across multiple platforms. Make sure you’re providing some additional value on social media and not just posting links to your videos (i.e. behind the scenes photos).</p><p>Building up social media pages will give you plenty of new search engine results with indexed content as well.</p><p>Most successful YouTube creators also have links to their social media accounts all across their channel banner and they regularly share their videos as soon as they are posted over their social media accounts so that their followers share their video too.</p><p>You should sign up for every social media platform you can think of with your channel name, just so that nobody else can use it, but you only need to actively use the platforms that are relevant to your audience. For example, lifestyle YouTubers should be on Instagram but gamers don’t need to be.</p><p> These are all <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >methods that anyone can use for free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Seeing improvements with your YouTube channel isn’t necessarily something that happens overnight but with dedicated work and marketing, you can start to see your channel grow. Consider using some of these strategies to <strong>increase YouTube views.</strong></p><p>Also want to create an attractive YouTube video?
