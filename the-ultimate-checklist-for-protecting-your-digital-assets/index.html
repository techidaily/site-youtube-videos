<p>One of the trickiest terrains for new YouTubers to navigate is the land of copyright rules.</p>
<p>We get it, it’s confusing and stressful, especially when what you want to focus on is making videos, but instead, you are worried about getting your account terminated or being sued.</p>
<p>Can you or can’t you use that song or that clip from the movie? That’s all you want to know.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to address the key areas that YouTubers need to understand when it comes to YouTube copyright. What is okay and what isn’t? What may be considered risky or what would be worth taking a chance?</p>
<p>Remember that everything discussed in this article is only best practices and shouldn’t be taken as definitive legal advice.</p>
<p>Now that we are set, let’s dive in:</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Fair Use?"></a>Part 1: What is Fair Use?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube copyright, we have to talk about fair use.</p>
<p>Without fair use, there wouldn’t be any flexibility for creators. There wouldn’t be mashups, parodies, or lip dubs. Without fair use, any video with copyright content such as music in the background or a reference to a scene from a famous movie will require approval from the content owner and can be removed. Because of fair use, you can publish a video with copyrighted material in it and not have to ask anyone.</p>
<p>Think of fair use as exceptions to copyright rules.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use"></a>Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use</h2><p>There are a few aspects YouTube looks at when it comes to determining whether creators are using copyrighted content that meets the fair use exceptions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the copyrighted content being creatively or purposefully used?</li>
<li>Are there more original content used than copyrighted content in the video?</li>
<li>Will your video benefit the original copyrighted content?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use"><a href="#Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use"></a>Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use</h2><p>Some acceptable styles of videos that allow you to exercise fair use are:</p>
<p><strong>Critiques and Reviews:</strong> You can use clips of a movie that you review or play a chorus from a song that you are analyzing in a video and it will be okay to use because it’s serving a purpose of educating the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials and Commentary:</strong> A YouTube gamer streaming the video games and making comments throughout, that is within fair use, because it can be said that it is giving the video game exposure. Additionally, anything that can be classified as tutorials can also fall under fair use. If you have a video teaching people how to play a famous song, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pGYeK0aiTQ" >The Beatles’ Let It Be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on piano, that’s fine!</p>
<p><strong>Mashups:</strong> Mashups tend to be built entirely out of copyrighted material, but when done well this style of videos are very creative and often serve to promote the original work as opposed to replacing it.</p>
<p>There couldn’t be two more different movies than Toy Story and Fight Club, but somehow thanks the the creativity of a YouTube creator, there is a now a mashup of it. Some might call it an abomination, but this type of recycled art takes skills and planning, and it wouldn’t exist without fair use.</p>
<p><strong>Parody:</strong> Imitation for comedic or dramatic effect is an artistic pursuit as long as it is done in a transformative manner. What does transformative mean? It means in some way, the original is being examined.</p>
<p>In this example from The Hillywood Show, we see a parody of both BBC’s Sherlock Holmes and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis’s Thrift Shop. The nuisance of the show and song recreated are there, but nobody who enjoys the originals will sit down and appreciate it in the same way. A parody is in no way trying to replace the original, but rather using the subject, structure, and style of the original as a vessel to another creative work.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike"></a>Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike</h2><p>If you are reading this, you may have already gotten a YouTube copyright strike.</p>
<p>This may have surprised you. Don’t be too concerned. If it was a mistake, the copyright strike merely acts as a warning, letting you know that the content in your video is copyrighted material.</p>
<p>However, if you were to get 3 copyright strikes in 90 days, you may be penalized by:</p>
<p>- Having all your accounts and videos removed</p>
<p>- Not being able to create a new channel</p>
<p>So what should you do? Here are the steps to take after you receive a copyright strike:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the copyright strike by going into Creator Studio &gt; Video Manager &gt; Copyright notice</li>
</ol>

                      alt="YouTube Copyright notice"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the “Copyright Strike” link beside the flagged video to see details</li>
<li>Decide how to respond to the strike:  <ol>
<li>Allow the strike to expire after 90 days and complete the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/copyright%5Fschool" >YouTube’s copyright school <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>  </li>
<li>Contact the person who reported your video and get the claim retracted  </li>
<li>Dispute the claim with a counter notification</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="Part-5-5-Ways-to-Avoid-Copyright-Strike"><a href="#Part-5-5-Ways-to-Avoid-Copyright-Strike" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: 5 Ways to Avoid Copyright Strike"></a>Part 5: 5 Ways to Avoid Copyright Strike</h2><p>It’s not always clear what YouTube deems fair use, but there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of meeting the qualification.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use non-fictional copyright content instead of creative and fictional copyrighted content.</strong> You’ll have a better chance of meeting fair use if you use footages from a news broadcast than you would from a movie or television show.</p>
<p>The intent is clear when using non-fictional copyright content, such as in Bad Lip Reading. They aren’t trying to rebroadcast the Mark Zuckerberg integration, they are parodying it. The easier it is for the public to recognize that the content is from a source, and understand that the creator isn’t trying to take credit for it, the more likely it’ll pass the fair use qualification.</p>
<p>However, if Bad Lip Reading posted the content without lip dubbing, then one can argue that they are taking views away from the original news sources and that wouldn’t be fair use.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make sure your video with copyrighted content isn’t replacing the original one.</strong> Only use enough of the source material to get your point across and ensure you are not negatively affecting the original through views and sales.</p>
<p>In this example from Screen Prism, we see scenes from Wes Anderson movies all through the video, however, it is not replacing any of the original films. In fact, you can say that because of this video, people will be motivated to go and watch a Wes Anderson movie, those benefiting the original creator.</p>
<p><strong>3. The copyrighted material is essential to your video.</strong> Whether the copyrighted content is needed in order to illustrate a point or if that one moment from a well-recognized movie helps tie together the message, as long as the copyrighted material is serving the video in some significant way, then it will be consider fair use.</p>
<p><strong>4. Give the original creator credit.</strong> Just because you give the original creator credit doesn’t mean you can rightfully use their content, however, it does give you a better chance at avoiding copyright strike. Most often, the original creators simply want credit for their work. If they see that you have noted that the content was made by them, it will only give them more exposure.</p>
<p><strong>5. Keep it short.</strong> There is no precise number of seconds or ratio of copyrighted to original footage you should have in your video to qualify as fair use. But generally, if the copyrighted clip is short and&#x2F;or broken up, then it stands a better chance at being approved by YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content"><a href="#Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content"></a>Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content</h2><p>As a new YouTuber, it’s a little freaky to think that someone is taking your content and republishing it or using your creations in their video without your permission.</p>
<p>If you ever notice that your content is being copied without your approval — if they have duplicated your video completely or is using your video without giving credit — and it is not benefiting your channel in any way, don’t worry, YouTube is designed to protect you.</p>

<h2 id="Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match"><a href="#Part-7-YouTube-Copyright-Match" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match"></a>Part 7: YouTube Copyright Match</h2><p>In 2018, YouTube launched a new feature called <strong>Copyright Match Tool</strong>, which automatically finds videos that are very similar or the same as the ones you’ve created. This gives you the power to determine what to do once you know the video exist.</p>
<p>- You can choose to do nothing.</p>
<p>- You can contact the publisher.</p>
<p>- You can report the video to YouTube for removal.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h2><p>I hope this article has clarified what you can and cannot do with copyrighted content. Here is a quick summary of what we touched on in this post:</p>
<p>- Avoid having 3 copyright strikes on your channel at all costs.</p>
<p>- When using copyrighted material, ensure it is essential to the video and you are not overdoing it.</p>
<p>- Make sure that the copyrighted content does not take views and sales away from the original source.</p>
<p>- Strive to use the copyrighted content in a transformative way, as a parody or a commentary, to educate or inform.</p>
<p>- Give the original creator credit or have it benefit the original by giving more publicity.</p>
<p>- Report any creator that is infringing on your content.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is the copyrighted content being creatively or purposefully used?</li>
<li>Are there more original content used than copyrighted content in the video?</li>
<li>Will your video benefit the original copyrighted content?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-1"><a href="#Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use"></a>Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use</h2><p>Some acceptable styles of videos that allow you to exercise fair use are:</p>
<p><strong>Critiques and Reviews:</strong> You can use clips of a movie that you review or play a chorus from a song that you are analyzing in a video and it will be okay to use because it’s serving a purpose of educating the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials and Commentary:</strong> A YouTube gamer streaming the video games and making comments throughout, that is within fair use, because it can be said that it is giving the video game exposure. Additionally, anything that can be classified as tutorials can also fall under fair use. If you have a video teaching people how to play a famous song, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pGYeK0aiTQ" >The Beatles’ Let It Be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on piano, that’s fine!</p>
<p><strong>Mashups:</strong> Mashups tend to be built entirely out of copyrighted material, but when done well this style of videos are very creative and often serve to promote the original work as opposed to replacing it.</p>
<p>There couldn’t be two more different movies than Toy Story and Fight Club, but somehow thanks the the creativity of a YouTube creator, there is a now a mashup of it. Some might call it an abomination, but this type of recycled art takes skills and planning, and it wouldn’t exist without fair use.</p>
<p><strong>Parody:</strong> Imitation for comedic or dramatic effect is an artistic pursuit as long as it is done in a transformative manner. What does transformative mean? It means in some way, the original is being examined.</p>
<p>In this example from The Hillywood Show, we see a parody of both BBC’s Sherlock Holmes and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis’s Thrift Shop. The nuisance of the show and song recreated are there, but nobody who enjoys the originals will sit down and appreciate it in the same way. A parody is in no way trying to replace the original, but rather using the subject, structure, and style of the original as a vessel to another creative work.</p>

<p>This may have surprised you. Don’t be too concerned. If it was a mistake, the copyright strike merely acts as a warning, letting you know that the content in your video is copyrighted material.</p>
<p>However, if you were to get 3 copyright strikes in 90 days, you may be penalized by:</p>
<p>- Having all your accounts and videos removed</p>
<p>- Not being able to create a new channel</p>
<p>So what should you do? Here are the steps to take after you receive a copyright strike:</p>

<p><strong>1. Use non-fictional copyright content instead of creative and fictional copyrighted content.</strong> You’ll have a better chance of meeting fair use if you use footages from a news broadcast than you would from a movie or television show.</p>
<p>The intent is clear when using non-fictional copyright content, such as in Bad Lip Reading. They aren’t trying to rebroadcast the Mark Zuckerberg integration, they are parodying it. The easier it is for the public to recognize that the content is from a source, and understand that the creator isn’t trying to take credit for it, the more likely it’ll pass the fair use qualification.</p>
<p>However, if Bad Lip Reading posted the content without lip dubbing, then one can argue that they are taking views away from the original news sources and that wouldn’t be fair use.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make sure your video with copyrighted content isn’t replacing the original one.</strong> Only use enough of the source material to get your point across and ensure you are not negatively affecting the original through views and sales.</p>
<p>In this example from Screen Prism, we see scenes from Wes Anderson movies all through the video, however, it is not replacing any of the original films. In fact, you can say that because of this video, people will be motivated to go and watch a Wes Anderson movie, those benefiting the original creator.</p>
<p><strong>3. The copyrighted material is essential to your video.</strong> Whether the copyrighted content is needed in order to illustrate a point or if that one moment from a well-recognized movie helps tie together the message, as long as the copyrighted material is serving the video in some significant way, then it will be consider fair use.</p>
<p><strong>4. Give the original creator credit.</strong> Just because you give the original creator credit doesn’t mean you can rightfully use their content, however, it does give you a better chance at avoiding copyright strike. Most often, the original creators simply want credit for their work. If they see that you have noted that the content was made by them, it will only give them more exposure.</p>
<p><strong>5. Keep it short.</strong> There is no precise number of seconds or ratio of copyrighted to original footage you should have in your video to qualify as fair use. But generally, if the copyrighted clip is short and&#x2F;or broken up, then it stands a better chance at being approved by YouTube.</p>

Without fair use, any video with copyright content such as music in the background or a reference to a scene from a famous movie will require approval from the content owner and can be removed. Because of fair use, you can publish a video with copyrighted material in it and not have to ask anyone.</p>
<p>Think of fair use as exceptions to copyright rules.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-YouTube-Considers-Fair-Use-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use"></a>Part 2: What YouTube Considers Fair Use</h2><p>There are a few aspects YouTube looks at when it comes to determining whether creators are using copyrighted content that meets the fair use exceptions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the copyrighted content being creatively or purposefully used?</li>
<li>Are there more original content used than copyrighted content in the video?</li>
<li>Will your video benefit the original copyrighted content?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-3"><a href="#Part-3-Types-of-Content-That-Meet-Fair-Use-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use"></a>Part 3: Types of Content That Meet Fair Use</h2><p>Some acceptable styles of videos that allow you to exercise fair use are:</p>
<p><strong>Critiques and Reviews:</strong> You can use clips of a movie that you review or play a chorus from a song that you are analyzing in a video and it will be okay to use because it’s serving a purpose of educating the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials and Commentary:</strong> A YouTube gamer streaming the video games and making comments throughout, that is within fair use, because it can be said that it is giving the video game exposure. Additionally, anything that can be classified as tutorials can also fall under fair use. If you have a video teaching people how to play a famous song, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pGYeK0aiTQ" >The Beatles’ Let It Be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, on piano, that’s fine!</p>
<p><strong>Mashups:</strong> Mashups tend to be built entirely out of copyrighted material, but when done well this style of videos are very creative and often serve to promote the original work as opposed to replacing it.</p>
<p>There couldn’t be two more different movies than Toy Story and Fight Club, but somehow thanks the the creativity of a YouTube creator, there is a now a mashup of it. Some might call it an abomination, but this type of recycled art takes skills and planning, and it wouldn’t exist without fair use.</p>
<p><strong>Parody:</strong> Imitation for comedic or dramatic effect is an artistic pursuit as long as it is done in a transformative manner. What does transformative mean? It means in some way, the original is being examined.</p>
<p>In this example from The Hillywood Show, we see a parody of both BBC’s Sherlock Holmes and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis’s Thrift Shop. The nuisance of the show and song recreated are there, but nobody who enjoys the originals will sit down and appreciate it in the same way. A parody is in no way trying to replace the original, but rather using the subject, structure, and style of the original as a vessel to another creative work.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike-3"><a href="#Part-4-What-To-Do-When-You-Get-a-YouTube-Copyright-Strike-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike"></a>Part 4: What To Do When You Get a YouTube Copyright Strike</h2><p>If you are reading this, you may have already gotten a YouTube copyright strike.</p>
<p>This may have surprised you. Don’t be too concerned. If it was a mistake, the copyright strike merely acts as a warning, letting you know that the content in your video is copyrighted material.</p>
<p>However, if you were to get 3 copyright strikes in 90 days, you may be penalized by:</p>
<p>- Having all your accounts and videos removed</p>
<p>- Not being able to create a new channel</p>
<p>So what should you do? Here are the steps to take after you receive a copyright strike:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the copyright strike by going into Creator Studio &gt; Video Manager &gt; Copyright notice</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Part-5-5-Ways-to-Avoid-Copyright-Strike-3"><a href="#Part-5-5-Ways-to-Avoid-Copyright-Strike-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: 5 Ways to Avoid Copyright Strike"></a>Part 5: 5 Ways to Avoid Copyright Strike</h2><p>It’s not always clear what YouTube deems fair use, but there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of meeting the qualification.</p>
<p><strong>1. Use non-fictional copyright content instead of creative and fictional copyrighted content.</strong> You’ll have a better chance of meeting fair use if you use footages from a news broadcast than you would from a movie or television show.</p>
<p>The intent is clear when using non-fictional copyright content, such as in Bad Lip Reading. They aren’t trying to rebroadcast the Mark Zuckerberg integration, they are parodying it. The easier it is for the public to recognize that the content is from a source, and understand that the creator isn’t trying to take credit for it, the more likely it’ll pass the fair use qualification.</p>
<p>However, if Bad Lip Reading posted the content without lip dubbing, then one can argue that they are taking views away from the original news sources and that wouldn’t be fair use.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make sure your video with copyrighted content isn’t replacing the original one.</strong> Only use enough of the source material to get your point across and ensure you are not negatively affecting the original through views and sales.</p>
<p>In this example from Screen Prism, we see scenes from Wes Anderson movies all through the video, however, it is not replacing any of the original films. In fact, you can say that because of this video, people will be motivated to go and watch a Wes Anderson movie, those benefiting the original creator.</p>
<p><strong>3. The copyrighted material is essential to your video.</strong> Whether the copyrighted content is needed in order to illustrate a point or if that one moment from a well-recognized movie helps tie together the message, as long as the copyrighted material is serving the video in some significant way, then it will be consider fair use.</p>
<p><strong>4. Give the original creator credit.</strong> Just because you give the original creator credit doesn’t mean you can rightfully use their content, however, it does give you a better chance at avoiding copyright strike. Most often, the original creators simply want credit for their work. If they see that you have noted that the content was made by them, it will only give them more exposure.</p>
<p><strong>5. Keep it short.</strong> There is no precise number of seconds or ratio of copyrighted to original footage you should have in your video to qualify as fair use. But generally, if the copyrighted clip is short and&#x2F;or broken up, then it stands a better chance at being approved by YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content-3"><a href="#Part-6-What-to-Do-When-Other-YouTubers-Are-Copying-Your-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content"></a>Part 6: What to Do When Other YouTubers Are Copying Your Content</h2><p>As a new YouTuber, it’s a little freaky to think that someone is taking your content and republishing it or using your creations in their video without your permission.</p>
<p>If you ever notice that your content is being copied without your approval — if they have duplicated your video completely or is using your video without giving credit — and it is not benefiting your channel in any way, don’t worry, YouTube is designed to protect you.</p>

<p>- Avoid having 3 copyright strikes on your channel at all costs.</p>
<p>- When using copyrighted material, ensure it is essential to the video and you are not overdoing it.</p>
<p>- Make sure that the copyrighted content does not take views and sales away from the original source.</p>
<p>- Strive to use the copyrighted content in a transformative way, as a parody or a commentary, to educate or inform.</p>
<p>- Give the original creator credit or have it benefit the original by giving more publicity.</p>
<p>- Report any creator that is infringing on your content.</p>

<p>If you are making videos on YouTube, you’ll have come to a point where you feel daring enough to take on the ultimate challenge: daily vlogging.</p>
<p>You might have been inspired by other creators on YouTube or you might have heard of VEDA: Vlog every day April (or August). You might have also watched some videos from influencers telling you that the ruthless YouTube algorithm demands daily content if you aspire to grow an audience.</p>

<h2 id="Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways"><a href="#Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways" class="headerlink" title="Why Daily Vlog Anyways?"></a><strong>Why Daily Vlog Anyways?</strong></h2><p> <strong>Build discipline</strong>: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.</p>
<p><strong>Practice more</strong>: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.</p>
<p><strong>Please the YouTube algorithm</strong>: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw" >view velocity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.</p>
<p>Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?</p>
<h2 id="The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1"><a href="#The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1" class="headerlink" title="The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging"></a><strong>The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First"><a href="#1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Get Some Experience First"></a><strong>1. Do Get Some Experience First</strong></h4><p>If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Film-Everything"><a href="#2-Don’t-Film-Everything" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Film Everything"></a><strong>2. Don’t Film Everything</strong></h4><p>Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.</p>
<h4 id="3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night"><a href="#3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)"></a><strong>3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)</strong></h4><p>Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.</p>
<p>Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).</p>
<h4 id="4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video"><a href="#4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video"></a><strong>4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video</strong></h4><p>The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.</p>

This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s hotkeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

Don’t Forget to Label Your Content</strong></h4><p>Staying organized is so important, especially as you begin to accumulate more and more footage. It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…</p>
<h4 id="7-Do-Have-A-Goal"><a href="#7-Do-Have-A-Goal" class="headerlink" title="7. Do Have A Goal"></a><strong>7. Do Have A Goal</strong></h4><p>Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.</p>
<h4 id="8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio"><a href="#8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio" class="headerlink" title="8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)"></a><strong>8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)</strong></h4><p>You’ve heard it before: you don’t need anything fancy to be a vlogger. If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube gear starter guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.</p>
<p>The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.</p>
<h4 id="9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere"><a href="#9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere"></a><strong>9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere</strong></h4><p>Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.</p>
<h4 id="10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health"><a href="#10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Neglect Your Health"></a><strong>10. Don’t Neglect Your Health</strong></h4><p>Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?</p>
<h4 id="11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers"><a href="#11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers"></a><strong>11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers</strong></h4><p>By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.</p>
<h4 id="12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience"><a href="#12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience"></a><strong>12.

<h2 id="Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways-1"><a href="#Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Daily Vlog Anyways?"></a><strong>Why Daily Vlog Anyways?</strong></h2><p> <strong>Build discipline</strong>: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.</p>
<p><strong>Practice more</strong>: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.</p>
<p><strong>Please the YouTube algorithm</strong>: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw" >view velocity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.</p>
<p>Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?</p>
<h2 id="The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-2"><a href="#The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-2" class="headerlink" title="The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging"></a><strong>The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First-1"><a href="#1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Get Some Experience First"></a><strong>1. Do Get Some Experience First</strong></h4><p>If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Film-Everything-1"><a href="#2-Don’t-Film-Everything-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Film Everything"></a><strong>2. Don’t Film Everything</strong></h4><p>Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.</p>
<h4 id="3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night-1"><a href="#3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)"></a><strong>3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)</strong></h4><p>Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.</p>
<p>Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).</p>
<h4 id="4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video-1"><a href="#4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video"></a><strong>4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video</strong></h4><p>The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.</p>
<h4 id="5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts-1"><a href="#5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts"></a><strong>5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts</strong></h4><p>Any chance you have to cut down on your editing time, use it. This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s hotkeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…</p>
<h4 id="7-Do-Have-A-Goal-1"><a href="#7-Do-Have-A-Goal-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Do Have A Goal"></a><strong>7. Do Have A Goal</strong></h4><p>Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.</p>
<h4 id="8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio-1"><a href="#8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="8.

If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube gear starter guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.</p>
<p>The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.</p>
<h4 id="9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere-1"><a href="#9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere"></a><strong>9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere</strong></h4><p>Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.</p>
<h4 id="10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health-1"><a href="#10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Neglect Your Health"></a><strong>10. Don’t Neglect Your Health</strong></h4><p>Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?</p>
<h4 id="11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers-1"><a href="#11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers-1" class="headerlink" title="11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers"></a><strong>11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers</strong></h4><p>By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.</p>
<h4 id="12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience-1"><a href="#12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience"></a><strong>12.

You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?</p>

Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers</strong></h4><p>By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.</p>

Don’t Forget About Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Remember that in the end, you are creating videos for someone else to enjoy. Even though you might be doing the daily vlog for yourself, if you want your viewers to return every day, you have to have an overall mission for your project. Is your message one that is aimed to motivate or do you want to document a journey? Don’t create your content in a vacuum, ask your viewers for feedback so you know how to improve.</p>
<p>Embarking on your daily vlogging adventure is not one to take lightly, but after 1 month, 1 season, or 1 year, you will be able to look back and see all that you have accomplished and feel proud. With the advice from this article, you can properly prepare yourself and enjoy each step of the process. Don’t overthink it, have fun!</p>

<h2 id="Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Daily-Vlog-Maker-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Daily-Vlog-Maker-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip-The Best Daily Vlog Maker- Wondershare Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip-The Best Daily Vlog Maker- Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Vlogging is an art and people use vlogging to upload videos daily to their YouTube channel.

<h2 id="Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways-3"><a href="#Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Daily Vlog Anyways?"></a><strong>Why Daily Vlog Anyways?</strong></h2><p> <strong>Build discipline</strong>: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.</p>
<p><strong>Practice more</strong>: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.</p>
<p><strong>Please the YouTube algorithm</strong>: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw" >view velocity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.</p>
<p>Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?</p>
<h2 id="The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-4"><a href="#The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-4" class="headerlink" title="The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging"></a><strong>The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First-3"><a href="#1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Get Some Experience First"></a><strong>1. Do Get Some Experience First</strong></h4><p>If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Film-Everything-3"><a href="#2-Don’t-Film-Everything-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Film Everything"></a><strong>2. Don’t Film Everything</strong></h4><p>Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.</p>
<h4 id="3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night-3"><a href="#3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)"></a><strong>3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)</strong></h4><p>Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.</p>
<p>Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).</p>
<h4 id="4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video-3"><a href="#4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video"></a><strong>4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video</strong></h4><p>The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.</p>
<h4 id="5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts-3"><a href="#5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts"></a><strong>5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts</strong></h4><p>Any chance you have to cut down on your editing time, use it. This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s hotkeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h4 id="6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content-3"><a href="#6-Don’t-Forget-to-Label-Your-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content"></a><strong>6. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content</strong></h4><p>Staying organized is so important, especially as you begin to accumulate more and more footage. It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…</p>
<h4 id="7-Do-Have-A-Goal-3"><a href="#7-Do-Have-A-Goal-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Do Have A Goal"></a><strong>7. Do Have A Goal</strong></h4><p>Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.</p>
<h4 id="8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio-3"><a href="#8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)"></a><strong>8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)</strong></h4><p>You’ve heard it before: you don’t need anything fancy to be a vlogger. If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube gear starter guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.</p>
<p>The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.</p>
<h4 id="9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere-3"><a href="#9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere"></a><strong>9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere</strong></h4><p>Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.</p>
<h4 id="10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health-3"><a href="#10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Neglect Your Health"></a><strong>10. Don’t Neglect Your Health</strong></h4><p>Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far.
