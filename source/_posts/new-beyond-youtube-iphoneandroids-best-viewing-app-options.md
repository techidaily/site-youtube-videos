**Price:** Free

This Freeware, open-source app is basically a lighter version of the YouTube app that doesn't require any Google Play services to run smoothly. NewPipe collects the URL source from YouTube and displays the information it gathers in the app that is completely independent of this platform. The app's users can search videos, view the video's info, or choose which streaming player they are going to use to watch the video. The app offers support for videos in 1080p, 2K, or 4K resolution, which means that you watch high-quality videos from your phone. The NewPipe app is a great choice for YouTubers who don't have powerful Android phones but still want to enjoy the benefits of browsing the world's largest video-sharing platform.
