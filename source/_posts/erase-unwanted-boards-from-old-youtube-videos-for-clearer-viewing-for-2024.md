## The Best Relaxation ASMR Apps for Android and iOS

The types of ASMR triggers the app offers, the diversity of its video selection or the quality of the audio are all important factors you will have to consider while choosing the ASMR app. Moreover, some apps enable you to customize the relaxing sounds that help you fall asleep. So, let's take a look at what the best relaxation ASMR apps for Android and iOS have to offer.

### 1\. [TeasEar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teasear-asmr-slime-simulator/id1439312630)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Textures can suite your nerves even if they are virtual. TeasEar enables you to simulate a more than a hundred slimy textures. Yogurt, Honey, or Confetti are just a few of the most popular textures you can experiment with, but there are many more available.

The app also lets you interact with each texture you generate, as you just have to place your fingers onto the surface of your Smartphone in order to produce the sound that can potentially trigger the ASMR.

However, the free version of the app grants you access to only a limited amount of triggers and you must purchase a weekly or monthly subscription in order to unlock all the triggers this app has to offer.

### 2\. [Tingles](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tingles-asmr-white-noise/id1181126709)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.designs1290.tingles&hl=en)

If you are looking for an app that can help you overcome insomnia, improve the quality of your sleep, or cope with anxiety then you should try installing Tingles. By doing so you will be able to watch videos from more than 1500 content creators.

The app allows you to listen to the video even when your screen is off, and you can also download content from Tingles and watch it while you are offline. You can browse through thousands of hours of content and choose to watch or listen to the videos that relax you the most. The app also has a sleep timer that ensures you’ll wake up when you want to.

Somnia offers Aubits, continuously blended, and mixed sound bits that can be used to create your own soundscapes. Keep in mind that you must purchase one of the available subscription packages if you want to use this app on an ongoing basis.

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindwell-mood-sleep-lab/id1242454382), Android

Nonetheless, the app helps its users improve the quality of their sleep by offering more than 350 daily mediations that last between one and thirty minutes. In addition, Mindwell also combines custom Solfeggio frequencies with custom isochronic tones in order to synchronize with your brainwaves and help you achieve the state of calmness.

The app lets you discover new videos daily, follow your favorite ASMR channels or share the ASMR videos you like on social media.

Finding ASMR content through the YouTube app is easy as there are so many different channels that produce videos that contain different types of ASMR triggers. On YouTube, you can find videos in which hosts are whispering into the microphone or tapping gently on it, as well as a broad range of videos that contain visual ASMR triggers. Although you can use the app for free, purchasing the YouTube Red or YouTube Premium will grant you access to a broader selection of ASMR videos.

The app has a Countdown Timer so that you can choose how long you want to sleep. The app’s dark background contributes to its relaxing and calming capabilities.

### 8\. [Super Slime Simulator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-slime-simulator/id1375330146)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dramaton.slime&hl=en)

Once you’ve selected the type of slime you want to play with you can start squishing, stretching, or popping it.

All slimes have a different texture and create different 3D sounds when you interact with them. The app also has the Fun Area where you can complete Lu Lu’s Slime quests, turn photos into slime, or even try slime painting. All you need to do in order to undo a stretch is shake your phone and you can continue playing with the slime you selected. Super Slime Simulator offers a unique ASMR experience although you must make in-app purchases in order to enjoy it fully.

The sound of cutting through sand may be satisfying and trigger the AMSR. This app enables you to cut through different types of objects made from sand. The realistic simulation of the cutting process, the sounds created while cutting through objects make playing this video game incredibly fun.

As you are leveling up, you’re gathering gold and unlocking new objects you can cut which makes the game more fun to play as you progress through it. Playing the ASMR Slicing game is certainly entertaining, as the relaxing sounds you’re making while cutting objects help you get rid of the stress. Even so, the app doesn’t really improve the quality of your sleep or assist you in overcoming anxiety or depression.
