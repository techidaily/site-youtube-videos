## What is Standard YouTube License?

A standard license is the permit from a competent authority to own or use of something. In terms of internet it is basically based on the permission of using, copying or distributing content that is available online. YouTube is a video sharing website with its own set of rules and regulations in accordance with its license policy.

When a user is uploading a video he has option license options that he can choose from. The first option is "standard YouTube License" which means that you grant the broadcasting rights to YouTube. This essentially means that your video can only be accessed from YouTube for watching purpose and cannot be reproduced or distributed in any other form without your consent. The second type of license is the ["Creative Commons"](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

In the below video you'll learn how to set standard YouTube license and cc license:

## What is the difference between "Standard YouTube License" and "Creative Commons"

The basic different is that, with a standard license no one can use your video to reproduce as his own work (without clearly marking the video of the original video). However in a standard licence the original video uploader has some right to say "no" to the re-use of his video because the meaning of the video changes altogether.

However, if you select the creative commons license while uploading then the author may use any portions of work of the original author. It is generally permitted to edit, recompile, change or alter the original work except few listed things. These include copyrights of original work and a clear mentioning that the work has been derived from an original source. Moreover, that the original author will not be held responsible for any damages caused by the derivative work. This is how the two licenses differ from each other.

## 3 Common questions for "YouTube standard license"?

* **Is it illegal for me to share Standard YouTube license video with my friends on Facebook?**

It is perfectly alright to share YouTube licensed videos on Facebook or any social media because firstly if sharing was prohibited then probably there wouldn't have been a share button plug in. Moreover, by clicking share or copy-pasting the URL you are just pointing to the video bearing its original author's name and URL. Hence, it's not illegal in any way.

* **Can media companies (such as TV show) feature my video without my permission?**

Media companies are generally richly profitable organizations. Hence before using content they need to seek legal permission from the original author of the video. This is especially the case when the owner of the video has used the standard license. It is then mandatory for the media house to take permission from the original video owner who had uploaded the video in the first place.

* **Can I use the videos marked as "YouTube standard license" for a non-profit video?**

For a YouTube standard licensed video there is hard and fast legal rule. The original author may claim his work as he has been given certain rights to do so. For a non-profit video yet again you might need to convince him on the fact that you haven't been gaining anything from usage of his content. So it's still recommendable to seek permission initially.
