## 6 YouTube Outro Makers With Templates

For even more End Screen Templates, [click here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/free-youtube-end-screen-templates%21-plus%3B-how-to-build-your-301.html).

#### 1. [Outro Maker](https://outromaker.com/blog/free-outro-templates-for-download)

**Overview:** _Outro Maker provides interactive, animated, end screens for YouTube videos at a low monthly cost._

On Outro Maker’s home page there’s a testimonials section featuring well-known YouTubers like Kandee Johnson. They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.

Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.

#### 2. [Biteable](https://biteable.com/)

**Overview:** _Biteable skews more towards intros than outros, but makes up for it by being free._

Biteable has free video templates for YouTube intros and outros. You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.

This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.

#### 3. [Tube Arsenal](https://tubearsenal.com/)

**Overview:** _Tube Arsenal allows you to customize your intro on the site and download it for about $10._

Tube Arsenal has animated outro templates/end screen cards as well as an on-site clip editor you can use to customize them with your channel’s colors/logo/images. They have template cards with slots for videos/playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.

Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).

#### 4. [Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/)

**Overview:** _Render Forest lets you download intros with 3D text for $20, and you can also use them as outros._

Render Forest is an intro maker that can also work as an outro maker (their templates aren’t set up like end screens). They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.

One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.

#### 5. [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

**Overview:** _Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text._

Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).

#### 6. [Intro Cave](https://introcave.com/)

**Overview:** _It costs $5 for a customized clip at Intro Cave._

As the name suggests, Intro Cave has a focus on intro videos. However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.

Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.

## YouTube Outro Maker Alternative-[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The video starts in black and white, with the boy band donning silk suits. After about 36 seconds, the color of the video changes. The choreography in the video reflects the upbeat and flirtatious vibe of this song. The band tried to put loads of emotions into it. Essentially, signature moves include brushing their hair back, kissing their hands, and giving a mischievous look.

Additionally, the video featured a technicolor elevator sequence whereby each member freestyles their dance moves. At one point, the septet forms the word ARMY using their bodies as a homage to their fans.

#### 2) Dynamite by BTS

After 20 minutes of its release, Butter broke the record by garnering the fastest 10 million views on YouTube.

The upbeat disco-pop song has elements of bubblegum pop, soul, and funk, and it takes influence from the Seventies music. It features celebratory horns, echoing synths, and snapping handclaps. The song is about feeling joy and appreciation for the small things in life that make it valuable.

#### 3) How You Like That by Blackpink

Blackpink's How You Like That was recorded in two languages (Japanese and Korean. It was released through Interscope Records, YG Plus, and YG Entertainment. It's a club, trap, hip hop, EDM, and pop song. The music video took one day and eight hours to amass 100 million YouTube views, making it one of the fastest 100 million views on YouTube.

The video starts with Jisoo, Lisa, Jennie, and Rosé sitting like monarchs on steps. The colorful music video shows the quartet delivering a strong kiss-off to an unseen enemy and a message of resilience. They also dance in different places in the video, displaying a range of dance moves.

#### 4) Boy With Love by BTS and Halsey

Boy with Luv is the lead single for BTS' 6th extended play called Map of the Soul: Persona. Its release date is April 12, 2019, under Big Hit Entertainment. The video garnered 100 million views in one day and 13 hours.

The music video has vibrant visuals, and it starts with the American singer and songwriter Halsey sitting bored behind a booth that sells tickets. The scene then flashes to BTS, clad in different shades of hot pink and delivering their dynamic choreography in front of Persona, a retro movie theater. The cinematic visual then unfolds, setting the septet against kaleidoscopic backdrops, as they dance, rap, and sing.

#### 5) Ice Cream by Blackpink Featuring Selena Gomez

In the music video, Selena, Lisa, Rosé Jisoo, and Jennie are wearing different clothes and sets. Selena is seen in a high-waisted, red-and-white-striped Shoshanna bikini; her next look includes an Eighties-inspired Puma bodysuit. The five girls portray several versions of today's woman image who know what they are worth and what they want.

#### 6) Lalisa by Lisa

Lalisa is the debut single by Lisa of Blackpink; it's the lead single from the musician's debut album of the same name. The song is a dynamic hip-hop track with influence from Thai culture. The music video garnered 100 million YouTube views in two days and one hour.

The video is visually-packed with ten set-ups and 13 outfit changes, making it exciting to watch. In the video, the artist appears sitting perched on an ornate throne, and she is adorned in gold jewelry with matching nails. The best part of her outfit is the traditional Thai headdress, which is tiered and anointed with flowers. Lisa ascends to the throne while she's alternately executing excellent, intricate choreography.

#### 7) Permission to Dance by BTS

Permission to Dance was released July 9, 2021, through Sony Music and Big Hit Music as a stand-alone single. It's the group's third English-language single. Mac, Andrews, and Stephen Kirk were in charge of the production.

The music video hit 100 million views in two days and two hours. In the video, the boy band wears cowboy outfits and breaks their dance moves in the Western background. The theme of Permission to Dance looks like the end of the coronavirus pandemic as nations resume their normal activities and declare the worst of this disease seems to be behind them.

#### 8) Life Goes on by BTS

Released through Columbia Records and Big Hit Entertainment on November 20, 2020, Life Goes On is the lead single from BTS' 5th Korean-language studio album Be. It was produced by j-hope, SUGA, Antonia Armato, Chris James, Ruuth, RM, and Pdogg.

The video reached 100 million views on YouTube in 2 days and 3 hours. And this makes it among the fastest 100 million views on YouTube. The band appears to be lounging lazily, playing a video game. One of the members comes, V, with pizza, and they enjoy it together. V then takes the other members for a drive. When they came back, they watched some movies. They later went to a stadium and performed this song without the audience.

#### 9) Kill This Love by Blackpink

Kill This Love was released by YG Entertainment on April 5, 2019, and it was distributed through Interscope Records and YG Plus.

Its official music video amassed 100 million views in 2 days and 14 hours.

The music video begins with introduction shots of each member of Blackpink; they are in a room surrounded by trumpets. Jennie performs with 2 massive swan set pieces with the sunset behind her. Lisa then struts around a candy shop as she knocks things off shelves and kicks displays. The scene with Jisoo is a stark contrast, as we see the sun against a black setting with her head being above a pool of water. Next, viewers will see a distraught Rosé, as she's driving a sports car fast chasing down her doppelganger.
