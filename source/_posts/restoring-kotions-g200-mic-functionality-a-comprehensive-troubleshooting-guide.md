3. **[Set your headset as the default device](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update the headset driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Make sure to use the correct Default Format](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Note: The screenshots below have been mostly taken from a Windows 10 operating system. If you are using Windows 11, please be aware that the visual appearance of your screen may vary slightly, but the steps to perform the task remain consistent.

### Fix 1: Set up the microphone correctly

 Before you try the following fixes, please make sure the mute button is not activated.

 Also, the microphone is highly directional, so it must be placed properly to achieve the best sound quality.

### Fix 2: Allow access to your microphone

 The first thing you need to make sure of is that your device allows apps to access your microphone. This is especially true if you can’t be heard in any apps.

Here’s how to do it:

 1) In the Windows Search box, type**microphone,** and select**Microphone privacy settings** .

 2) Please be sure to turn on “**Allow access to the microphone on this device** ” and “**Allow apps to access your microphone** “.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image.png)

 3) Scroll down to allow microphone access for the Microsoft apps and desktop apps.

 Now you can test recording and see if your SteelSeries Arctis Pro mic is working right now. But if not, please move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update the headset driver

 The microphone on your SteelSeries Arctis Pro won’t work if you’re using an incorrect or outdated driver. So if the fixes above didn’t work, you should try updating the driver to see if it does the trick.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming, technical, and risky, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
