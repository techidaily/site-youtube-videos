Find Your YouTube Comments on an iPhone"></a>2. Find Your YouTube Comments on an iPhone</h3><p>Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the YouTube app for iOS doesn’t have the feature to view your comments history. However, there is a workaround where you can use a web browser on your smartphone to get this done. The process that is given below explains how to view your past YouTube comments on an iPhone:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Sign In to Your YouTube Account on an Internet Browser</strong></p><p>Launch your favorite web browser on your iPhone (Safari, the default one, is used here for illustration), go to <a class="link"   href="https://m.youtube.com/" >https://m.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, tap the profile icon from the top-right corner, tap <strong>Sign in</strong> from the menu that appears, and follow the on-screen instructions to use your Google account credentials to sign in to YouTube.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Access the Desktop Version of YouTube</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>More Options</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the browser, and then tap <strong>Request Desktop Website</strong> from the menu that appears to access the desktop version of YouTube on your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/request-desktop-website-youtube.jpg"                      alt="Access the Desktop Version of YouTube"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: View Your Past YouTube Comments</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube page, and tap <strong>History</strong> from the menu that appears. On the <strong>History</strong> page, tap <strong>Comments</strong> from the right pane to view&#x2F;access your YouTube comments that you posted in the past.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-past-youtube-comments-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Access the Desktop Version of YouTube"                ></p><h3 id="3-Find-Your-YouTube-Comments-on-an-Android-Smartphone"><a href="#3-Find-Your-YouTube-Comments-on-an-Android-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="3. Find Your YouTube Comments on an Android Smartphone"></a>3. Find Your YouTube Comments on an Android Smartphone</h3><p>As it is with iOS, the YouTube app for Android doesn’t allow you to view your comments history either. However, the workaround of using a web browser works pretty well on Android smartphones too, but with a few tweaks. The process of doing so is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Use a Web Browser to Sign In to Your YouTube Account</strong></p><p>Launch <strong>Google Chrome</strong> on your Android smartphone (you can use any other web browser of your choice), and go to <a class="link"   href="https://m.youtube.com/" >https://m.youtube.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Notice how the interface automatically changes to the desktop version. <strong>Note:</strong> If the desktop version of the website isn’t visible, you can tap the <strong>More</strong> button (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner of the browser, and check the <strong>Desktop site</strong> box.</p><p>Next, tap <strong>SIGN IN</strong> from the top-right corner of the YouTube page, enter your Google account credentials in the box available on the <strong>Sign in</strong> screen, enter your password when prompted, and sign in to your YouTube account.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose a Web Browser (for Confirmation)</strong></p><p>When the confirmation box pops up at the bottom, choose your preferred web browser, and tap the frequency of its usage for accessing YouTube. For instance, choose <strong>Chrome</strong> and <strong>Just once</strong> to use <strong>Google Chrome</strong> to access YouTube only for this session.</p><p><strong>Step 3: View&#x2F;Access Your Past YouTube Comments</strong></p><p>Once you are signed in to your account, tap the <strong>Menu</strong> icon from the top-left corner of the YouTube page, and tap <strong>History</strong> from the menu that appears. When the <strong>History</strong> page opens up, tap <strong>Comments</strong> from the right pane to view and&#x2F;or access your past YouTube comments.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-All-YouTube-Comments-Your-Channel-Has-Received"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-All-YouTube-Comments-Your-Channel-Has-Received" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Find All YouTube Comments Your Channel Has Received?"></a>Part 2: How to Find All YouTube Comments Your Channel Has Received?</h2><p>If you own a YouTube channel and have posted several videos there, it is likely that you also have received a decent number of comments. Usually, these remarks are pretty helpful as they tell you how to improve your production quality, and what your audience prefers to watch in the future. Therefore, it is imperative to learn how to find all the comments that your YouTube channel has received, and the process given below explains exactly that:</p><h3 id="1-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Desktop-or-Laptop-Computer"><a href="#1-Find-Your-Channel’s-YouTube-Comments-on-a-Desktop-or-Laptop-Computer" class="headerlink" title="1.

Find Your Channel’s YouTube Comments on a Mobile App</h3><p>This process is comparatively simpler than the previous one as all that you need to do is download the YT Studio app, and access a central location where all the comments for all the videos can be viewed. The process is given below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Obtain a Mobile App</strong></p><p>Go to <strong>App Store</strong> or <strong>Google Play Store</strong>, and search and download the <strong>YT Studio</strong> app on your iPhone or Android smartphone (iPhone X is used here for illustration).</p><p><strong>Step 2: View&#x2F;Access All the Comments</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>YT Studio</strong> app, and sign in to your YouTube account.

However, it is recommended that you do all such sensitive tasks on a laptop or desktop computer to avoid any errors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-youtube-channel-comments-mobile.jpg"                      alt="Find  YouTube Comments mobile"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Find-Someone’s-YouTube-Comments-by-User-Name"><a href="#Part-3-Find-Someone’s-YouTube-Comments-by-User-Name" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Find Someone’s YouTube Comments by User Name"></a>Part 3: Find Someone’s YouTube Comments by User Name</h2><p>If any of your YouTube videos has thousands of comments and you need to find a particular one from a specific user, checking each remark manually would be an extremely time-consuming and tedious task.

Some important tips that might come in handy in this regard are suggested below:</p><ul><li>Make your comment as relevant to the video as you possibly can</li><li>Avoid using harsh language or slangs to maintain decency</li><li>Be genuine while leaving feedback. However, make sure to choose polite words while typing a comment</li><li>In case you want to add some suggestions, make sure to be humble</li><li>Ignore the replies with inappropriate content</li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-About-YouTube-Comments"><a href="#FAQs-About-YouTube-Comments" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About YouTube Comments"></a>FAQs About YouTube Comments</h2><p><strong>Q1) Why can’t I see the comments I posted?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> If you cannot see your comments, this could be because the owner or moderator has configured the channel or the video to hold all the comments for review before they are visible on YouTube.</p><p>In such a case, you are advised to wait for the authorized person to approve your remark before it is published. Another possibility is that the moderator&#x2F;owner has added you to the ‘hidden users’ list due to some reason. Even in this case, your comment won’t be visible until you are removed from that list.</p><p><strong>Q2) I have enabled</strong> <strong>‘Notify me’ about comments and other activity on my channel or videos, but can’t see the comments on my video.

As soon as you start a YouTube channel, you will already be on this level until you get up to 1K subscribers. During this time, you should focus on learning how YouTube works and perfecting your video production and editing skills.

YouTubers with a Silver Play Button probably won’t be earning enough money from YouTube to support themselves, but they’re in a good position to start going after more lucrative brand deals. Creators at this level may be earning enough to invest in some better camera gear. Channels at this level are also eligible to apply for a digital verification badge.</p><h3 id="5-The-Gold-Creator-Award-1-million-10-million-subscribers"><a href="#5-The-Gold-Creator-Award-1-million-10-million-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#5: The Gold Creator Award (1 million-10 million subscribers)"></a><strong>#5: The Gold Creator Award (1 million-10 million subscribers)</strong></h3><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-award-gold-plaque.jpg"                      alt="play-btn-awards-gold-level"                ></strong></p><p><em>If people mean graphite when they say ‘lead,’ and alchemists turn lead into gold, then is YouTube really about alchemy?</em></p><p>At this level, you’re making money. When you first reach 1 million, it may still not be enough to live off of, but you’re getting close to being able to make YouTube your job (which you will probably be able to do before leaving the Gold Level). Things like your own makeup line or a book deal are not out of the question at this point.</p><h3 id="6-The-Diamond-Creator-Award-10-million-50-million-subscribers"><a href="#6-The-Diamond-Creator-Award-10-million-50-million-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="#6: The Diamond Creator Award (10 million-50 million subscribers)"></a><strong>#6: The Diamond Creator Award (10 million-50 million subscribers)</strong></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-awards-diamond.jpg"                      alt="play-btn-awards-diamond-level"                ></p><p>You’re a YouTube star. You’ve made it. You’re making enough money that YouTube&#x2F;projects spawned from your YouTube channel support you completely, and you’ve probably got a team of helpers. Expect to be going on tours to meet and perform for your fans’ live. Also, if you didn’t have a book deal before, you almost definitely have one now.</p><h2 id="Super-High-Level-1"><a href="#Super-High-Level-1" class="headerlink" title="Super High Level"></a>Super High Level</h2><p>The awards in these levels are absent from the Creator Awards page.

If you are able to obtain the award at this level, monetization should never be for you to worry about. One hundred million subscribers mean that 1.3% of the people on this planet are watching you. You’d be a legend if you made it. As of August 2020, only PewDiePie and T-series have obtained this award.</p><p>Click here to check out the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >5 most subscribed YouTubers. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Welp.

The only trouble is that both Instagram and IGTV have very precise <strong>video upload requirements</strong>, so each video you want to share on your IGTV channel must be <strong>saved in MP4 file format and in a 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>.</p><p>YouTube videos, on the other hand, are mostly horizontally oriented. If you attempt to <strong>upload a YouTube video to IGTV</strong> and wondering how to achieve it, just keep reading. Because in this article, we are going to show you how you can convert a horizontal YouTube video into IGTV vertical one in 3 different ways.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Re-post YouTube Video to IGTV with Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Use YouTube to IGTV Online Converter</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Convert YouTube Video to IGTV with FXP</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Convert-YouTube-Videos-to-IGTV-Vertical-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-1-Convert-YouTube-Videos-to-IGTV-Vertical-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Convert YouTube Videos to IGTV Vertical Videos with Filmora"></a>Part 1: Convert YouTube Videos to IGTV Vertical Videos with Filmora</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>If you don’t already have the original file of the video you’d like to upload to your IGTV channel, you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download a video from YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but keep in mind that you can’t use any content without permission from its owner.</p><p>Once you have the file, you can <strong>create a new project</strong> in Filmora and then after the project loads you should click on the <strong>File menu</strong> and select the <strong>Project Settings option</strong>.

If you opt for this method of creating a vertical video for IGTV, your video will remain the same size, but the viewers will have to hold their phones horizontally in order to view it properly.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Convert MKV to MP4 without Losing Quality [Free Converters Provided] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro"></a>Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Editing videos with professional video editing software products like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro requires a certain amount of skill. There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to <strong>set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. During the video editing process, you will have to <strong>resize all of the footage</strong> you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.</p><p>If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media. Do you know another way of changing a YouTube video’s aspect ratio before re-posting it on IGTV?

Former PayPal employees Chad Hurley, Steven Chen and Jawed Karim founded YouTube in 2005 and only a year later their platform was one of the world’s fastest growing websites, surpassing MySpace with more than 100 million video views in the July of the same year. It wasn’t long before YouTube was purchased by Google on November 13. 2006 and since then the world’s most popular video sharing platform has grown continuously.</p><p>In 2017, more than 500 hours of video content are being uploaded to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> each minute, and over 1.5 billion active users utilize it to share their memories, music they love, business ideas or anything else they feel strongly about. The following infographic will present some of the most interesting YouTube facts and statistics that will enable you to understand better one of the most popular websites ever created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/mind-blowing-youtube-stats-facts-2017.jpg"                      alt="mind blowing youtube stats facts 2017"                ></p><p>It’s hard to pick highlights from such an interesting and comprehensive read, but a couple of key stats shine out.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube has just 0,5 billion users less than Facebook</strong></li></ul><p>Mark Zuckerberg is perhaps one of the best-known business geniuses who made his fortune by creating the social network everyone wanted to be a part of. With more than 2 billion active users Facebook is the largest online community on the Internet today. YouTube has 1.5 billion active monthly users which makes it the second largest platform of its kind, well ahead of Instagram, LinkedIn or Twitter.</p><ul><li><strong>People aged 24 to 44 watch the most videos on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>This information isn’t particularly surprising since younger generations use the Internet more frequently than the older ones. 49% of all YouTube users are aged between 24 and 44, but this statistic will likely change in the future since YouTube’s popularity can only increase. What comes in as a surprise is the fact that men spend 24% more time on YouTube than women. Could it be that men are more interested in music, short videos or promotional business videos than women or perhaps, women are simply more practical and thus tend to spend less time aimlessly going through endless video content.</p><ul><li><strong>9% of the videos are taken down because of the copyright infringements</strong></li></ul><p>At one point in the early 2000’s, it seemed as if the copyright laws will be changed forever by the Internet. Since then countless initiatives have prevented YouTube users to view, upload or share content that they don’t have the permission to use. In 2017, 9% of all videos uploaded on YouTube are taken down by the copyright holders. This means that YouTubers must make sure that all content they upload is unique or that they at least have a permission to use it.</p><ul><li><strong>An average person spends 40 minutes on YouTube each day</strong></li></ul><p>YouTube is probably one of the best pastimes the Internet can offer, and for that reason, a common person spends 40 minutes on YouTube per day. When you add an average life expectancy into the equation the math shows that during their lifetimes, people spend nearly 2 years on YouTube, or 1 year and 10 months to be exact.</p><ul><li><strong>Pop music singers are the most popular celebrities on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p>Naturally, music is the most searched term on YouTube, and celebrities like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry or Rihana have millions of subscribers with billions of total video views. Unlike Facebook where the most popular celebrities are Christiano Ronaldo or Vin Diesel, an actor and a football player, YouTube stars are mostly musicians and Pop Culture icons whose music is available to fans across the globe because of this platform. Some of the historically most viewed videos on YouTube are Luis Fonsi’s Despacito, Psy’s Gangnam Style or Tayler Swift’s Shake it Off that all have a staggering amount of views.</p><p>Let us know what you think about these interesting facts about YouTube in the comments below and feel free to share this article with your friends and colleagues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-ensemble-dynamics-crafting-collaborative-content-for-musicians/"><u>In 2024, Ensemble Dynamics  Crafting Collaborative Content for Musicians</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/earning-through-youtube-partnerships-for-2024/"><u>Earning Through YouTube Partnerships for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/1716464925942-find-rich-ambiance-for-video-content/"><u>Find Rich Ambiance for Video Content!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-comprehensive-overview-of-youtube-standards-for-content-creators/"><u>2024 Approved  A Comprehensive Overview of YouTube Standards for Content Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/top-flick-alternatives-indie-worthy-2023-releases/"><u>Top Flick Alternatives  Indie-Worthy 2023 Releases</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/unlocking-online-potential-mastering-the-art-of-thumbnail-sizing/"><u>Unlocking Online Potential  Mastering the Art of Thumbnail Sizing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/digital-splendor-on-youtube-the-hue-harmonization-way-for-2024/"><u>Digital Splendor on YouTube  The Hue Harmonization Way for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/tips-for-incorporating-songs-in-instagram-stories-withwithout/"><u>Tips for Incorporating Songs in Instagram Stories (With/Without)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/set-your-preferred-job-location-on-linkedin-app-of-your-nokia-c02-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Set Your Preferred Job Location on LinkedIn App of your Nokia C02 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-improving-user-experience-vimeo-video-subtitles/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Improving User Experience  Vimeo Video Subtitles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-instagrams-hidden-gems-designing-stunning-engaging-puzzle-posts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Instagram's Hidden Gems  Designing Stunning, Engaging Puzzle Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-media-subtitles-transformation/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Media Subtitles Transformation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/fixing-the-obs-fullscreen-hurdle/"><u>Fixing the OBS Fullscreen Hurdle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-professional-movie-making-on-youtube-and-similar-software/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Professional Movie Making on YouTube & Similar Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-spotify-marketing-manual-strategies-and-tactics/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Spotify Marketing Manual  Strategies and Tactics</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

To work on memorable travel videos, I would recommend the following suggestions.</p><h4 id="Record-tons-of-footage"><a href="#Record-tons-of-footage" class="headerlink" title="Record tons of footage"></a>Record tons of footage</h4><p>Most importantly, make sure that you have recorded a lot of content that you can include in your videos. You can later get rid of any content that you don’t like. Though, if you don’t have the right footage, then you won’t be able to create your video in the first place.</p><h4 id="Focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time"><a href="#Focus-on-one-thing-at-a-time" class="headerlink" title="Focus on one thing at a time"></a>Focus on one thing at a time</h4><p>While traveling, you can get overwhelmed and might try to include a lot of things in a single video. Instead, try to focus on one central idea for the video. For instance, you can make a video on your visit to a local market or a historic site. If you want to include more, then make a video collage of the entire trip.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="Add-voiceovers"><a href="#Add-voiceovers" class="headerlink" title="Add voiceovers"></a>Add voiceovers</h4><p>A lot of content creators might not realize this, but voiceovers are extremely important in travel videos. Apart from the visual shots, you should include your experience of what you felt at that time. If you didn’t record your reaction in the original video, then use an editing tool like Filmora to add voiceovers later on.</p><h4 id="Edit-your-videos-with-an-excellent-video-editor"><a href="#Edit-your-videos-with-an-excellent-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="Edit your videos with an excellent video editor"></a>Edit your videos with an excellent video editor</h4><p>If you wish to come up with appealing travel videos, then a video editor would be a must-have tool for you. I would recommend using <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>, which is one of the most extensive and user-friendly video editors out there. You can easily clip the footage of your choice, add voiceovers, and include different transitions. There are tons of presets and media layers that you can include in your videos to make them stand out.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="Be-authentic"><a href="#Be-authentic" class="headerlink" title="Be authentic"></a>Be authentic</h4><p>In the end, make sure that you share a genuine experience with others.

It’s a big world where new things happen every day, in every <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube niche <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. One of the best ways to climb to the top of YouTube’s search engine results is to be among the first creators to make a video about a trending topic.</p><p>But how do you know what’s trending? If you’re in a huge genre like beauty or technology then it’s not impossible to keep track of the latest news and trends, but you probably hear about things as other people start making videos and as websites start publishing articles. How do you get on top of trends just as they’re becoming trends?</p><p>Google Trends, of course!</p><p>Google Trends is a completely free tool you can use to determine what’s trending on YouTube or in Google’s search engine. Here’s how you can use Google Trends to figure out what’s trending in your niche and make a video before there’s tons of competition.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture"><a href="#Part-1-Seeing-The-Big-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture"></a>Part 1: Seeing The Big Picture</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-use-google-trends-to-come-up-with-video-seeing-big-picture.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Ideas"                ></p><p><em>You’ll need to be signed into your Google account to use Google Trends.</em></p><p>Start off at <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >trends.google.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and you’ll see what’s trending in general – usually big news stories or things like sports finals. The data is laid out like this: at the top there are three ‘Featured Insights’. These are three of the most popular trending topics paired with graphs of their recent search traffic. Underneath these there will be a list of stories that are currently trending. You can click on them to see charts of their search data and links to where the stories are being covered online.</p><p>Unless you do news or political commentary on your channel these probably aren’t topics you want to cover, but if you like to insert some topical references into your other videos then it’s still good to be aware of these things.</p><p>To get information more relevant to your channel you’re going to have to do some filtering.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Results-That-Matter-to-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You"></a>Part 2: Getting Results That Matter to You</h2><p>In the Google Trend home page, scroll down to the ‘Recently Trending’ section and click on ‘More Trending Searches’.</p><p>Then click from ‘Daily Search Trends’ to ‘Realtime Search Trends’.</p><p>On top you will see two drop-down menus, one is for the category and one is for location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-video-ideas.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Video Ideas"                ></p><p>Under <strong>All categories</strong> select the general theme your channel falls under.</p><p>Your options are business, entertainment, health, Sci&#x2F;Tech, sports, and top stories.</p><p>It might be the case that your channel doesn’t fall under any of these themes, but there could still be related stories for you in other categories. For example, if you have a beauty channel then there could be something that’d interest you under health, entertainment, or even business.</p><p>Under the <strong>location menu</strong> choose the region most of your viewers are from. This might not be the same as where you are from – you could be in Australia and most of your viewers could be in the U.S. If you’re not sure where your viewers are from you can find out in your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> under <strong>Analytics &gt; Demographics</strong>.</p><p>Once you have narrowed down your results you can just scroll through and pick out a topic related to your channel’s theme that you have something to say about.</p><p>For example, if you have a gaming channel and you’re looking for a non-gameplay topic to make a video on, you would look under Sci&#x2F;Tech. If I look under that category today (May 29, 2017) and specify that I want topics trending in the United States then these are my top 5 results:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-categories.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Category YouTube Video Ideas"                ></p><p>The first two happen to be about gaming. If you, as a gamer, had any strong reaction to either of these topics – whether it’s that you feel like you’re knowledgeable about them, or that you’re excited by something that’s coming up, or that something made you groan – then that would be a sign that you should make a video. Capitalizing on a trend while also covering a topic you have a lot to say about is always a good move.</p><p>Having something to say doesn’t have to mean having a strong opinion. If you just find something interesting and want to pass the information along to your viewers then that’s great too.</p><p>Clicking on these results will give you more specific data including how often the topic has been searched recently and links to recent news articles. These can give you a better idea of why it is trending and help you come up with what you want to say.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords"><a href="#Part-3-Battle-of-the-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Battle of the Keywords"></a>Part 3: Battle of the Keywords</h2><p>Once you have a topic in mind for your next video – whether it came from Google Trends or your own noggin – think about what the most important keyword for that topic might be.</p><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-12-step-youtube-seo-guide-for-beginners-who-want-more-448.html" >keyword is a word or short phrase <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that people type into a search engine like Google or YouTube. In order for people to find your videos, you’ll have to include a keyword in your video’s title.</p><p>Once you have a keyword in mind, type it into the Explore bar at the top of your page in Google Trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/explore-topic-in-google-trends.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Keywords YouTube Video"                ></p><p>What happens after you click <strong>enter</strong> is pretty much magic. Say I want to make a video on how to use Filmora. The first thing I’ll type into that Explore bar is ‘Filmora’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Keywords"                ></p><p>You can see near the top that this chart represents searches for the topic over the last 5 years, which isn’t necessarily useful (although it is sort of cool that you can see when Filmora was ‘born’). I’m going to narrow that down to results from the U.S in the last week.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-time-range.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends YouTube Video Ideas Filmora"                ></p><p>There, now I can see how the popularity of Filmora as a search term has spiked on specific days and times (if you hover over a spike it tells you the time and day) and plan to post my video at a time that capitalizes on these trends.</p><p>Next, what other words do I want to include in my video title? Is this a review, a tutorial, or a how-to? By clicking on my search term Filmora, I can edit it to read ‘filmora review’. Then I can click <strong>+ Compare</strong> and type in ‘filmora tutorial’ and ‘how to use Filmora’. Google Trends will create a chart comparing the popularity of those 3 terms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-search-term-comparison.jpg"                      alt="Google Trends Filmora Keywords"                ></p><p><em>I also ‘zoomed out’ to 90 days – if I’d only looked at how they compared over the last week my results could have been skewed.</em></p><p>It’s pretty clear from the chart that ‘filmora review’ is the strongest of those 3 search terms. The title of my video should definitely start with the words <strong>Filmora Review</strong> because that is what most people are searching for when they want information about Filmora. Putting your most important keyword&#x2F;search term first in your video titles will help them rank better in the viewer’s search results.</p><p>Although, when you do a comparison like this you should also go to YouTube and search for each potential keyword&#x2F;phrase individually. It might turn out that there is a ton of strong competition for the most popular search term, and not as much for the second or third most popular. Here’s a search for ‘Filmora Review’ on YouTube:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-trends-youtube-keyword-search.jpg"                      alt="YouTube search Filmora Keyword"                ></p><p><em>If my view of YouTube looks different from yours it’s because I’m using the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en" >VidIQ plugin for Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free and it gives you all kinds of extra info about videos and channels.</em></p><p>The second-highest ranked result is only 2 months old and isn’t from a huge channel. Although there is competition for this keyword, ranking for it is not impossible. It also helps that software reviews are a topic where people will always be looking for the latest information&#x2F;newest videos.</p><p>If the search results for your keyword are dominated by monster channels with millions of subs, and you can’t think of an angle you can use to crack into those top results (i.e. having newer information people will be looking for, which the more established videos are lacking), then maybe try the search with your second best keyword and see if there’s a better opportunity for you to rank there.</p><p>One of the biggest benefits of identifying trends and making videos about them quickly is that you can get in before there’s a lot of competition for the first few pages of search results on YouTube or Google, and before larger channels start making videos of their own on the same topic.</p><p>Want to make coming up with YouTube video ideas a habit? <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html" >This post here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will help you develop a process to generate more ideas and properly evaluate them.</p><h2 id="Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Making-Better-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Making Better YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Making Better YouTube Videos with Filmora</h2><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers, Filmora provides plentiful editing tools, such as cut, trim, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >noise removal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >chroma key compositing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and color grading.

Your outro, or end screen, on YouTube is your last chance to keep viewers on your channel. This can help you increase your channel’s watch time and get your videos ranked higher in search results.</p><p>Here are 6 outro maker sites where you can get outros and end cards.

Outro Maker"></a>1. Outro Maker</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Outro Maker provides interactive, animated, end screens for YouTube videos at a low monthly cost.</em></p><p>On Outro Maker’s home page there’s a testimonials section featuring well-known YouTubers like Kandee Johnson. They’ve definitely got the social proof to back up their claims about ease and quality.</p><p>Outro Maker is a paid service ($3 per month for the basic package) and the biggest issue facing it is that a lot of the features it charges for have become free features of YouTube’s own end screen tool. You get access to templates and a template maker with Outro Maker, though, and that may be the important thing for you.</p><h4 id="2-Biteable"><a href="#2-Biteable" class="headerlink" title="2. Biteable"></a>2. Biteable</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Biteable skews more towards intros than outros, but makes up for it by being free.</em></p><p>Biteable has free video templates for YouTube intros and outros. You can use one of their pre-built options, or you can customize one of their video styles with your own logo, colors, and music.</p><p>This site definitely skews more towards intros than outros and they don’t really provide end screen cards. It would be up to you to choose a video style and customize it to make it work for your purpose, which shouldn’t be too much of a burden since the site is free.</p><h4 id="3-Tube-Arsenal"><a href="#3-Tube-Arsenal" class="headerlink" title="3. Tube Arsenal"></a>3. Tube Arsenal</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Tube Arsenal allows you to customize your intro on the site and download it for about $10.</em></p><p>Tube Arsenal has animated outro templates&#x2F;end screen cards as well as an on-site clip editor you can use to customize them with your channel’s colors&#x2F;logo&#x2F;images. They have template cards with slots for videos&#x2F;playlists as well as logos and subscribe buttons.</p><p>Tube Arsenal’s outros tend to cost $9 for 720p and $11 for 1080p. Some of their options include stylized ‘reveals’ of the ‘next video’ slots (i.e. they appear bit-by-bit from left to right) which will not be smoothly compatible with YouTube’s end screen tool (where the video previews will simply pop up).</p><h4 id="4-Renderforest"><a href="#4-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="4. Renderforest"></a>4. Renderforest</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Render Forest lets you download intros with 3D text for $20, and you can also use them as outros.</em></p><p>Render Forest is an intro maker that can also work as an outro maker (their templates aren’t set up like end screens). They have a lot of 3D options, which is something only a few other outro makers can offer, and they have been used by a lot of major brands.</p><p>One drawback of Renderforest is that it is significantly more expensive than other services on this list. It will cost you $20 for a 720p clip.</p><h4 id="5-Panzoid"><a href="#5-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="5. Panzoid"></a>5. Panzoid</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>Panzoid is a completely free service where you can get high-quality outros with 3D text.</em></p><p>Panzoid is a community-driven site where creators make templates for intros and outros and post them for other creators to customize and download for free. There are a lot of high-quality clips on Panzoid, and most of what you find is 3D (a major perk).</p><h4 id="6-Intro-Cave"><a href="#6-Intro-Cave" class="headerlink" title="6. Intro Cave"></a>6. Intro Cave</h4><p><strong>Overview:</strong> <em>It costs $5 for a customized clip at Intro Cave.</em></p><p>As the name suggests, Intro Cave has a focus on intro videos. However, you can still use their customization system as an outro maker.</p><p>Although things do go on sale, they tend to charge $5 for a 720p clip.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#YouTube-Outro-Maker-Alternative-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Outro Maker Alternative- Wondershare Filmora"></a>YouTube Outro Maker Alternative- Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is a great video editor for all creators. It has a large collection of video transitions, filters, overlays and text templates which can also help you customize your own templates. And its intuitive interface and easy-to-use editing tools will make your editing more efficient and quick!

This attention span applies to all internet platforms including YouTube. YouTube is the second largest and most visited search engine after Google. It provides users with information through engaging and eye-catchy videos. However, certain videos are longer where only a particular section of the video holds the important information. Viewers tend to skip the long videos and if you do not want this to happen to you, you can link to that specific part on your video adding value for your channel viewers with a link known as the YouTube Timestamp link.</p><p>When you have a Timestamp link on your video, you can help your viewers directly reach the specific time in the video. This helps avoid the viewers from losing interest or to search for the key part in your video themselves.</p><p>Here in this article, we will explain Timestamp links, how to add Timestamp to YouTube video links, and what are the benefits of Timestamp.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: YouTube Timestamp Links Introduction</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Adding a Timestamp to YouTube Video Link on Desktop</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Share Specific Parts of YouTube Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">part 4: Getting YouTube Timestamp Link on Mobile</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: FAQ About YouTube Timestamps</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-YouTube-Timestamp-Links"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-YouTube-Timestamp-Links" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is YouTube Timestamp Links"></a>Part 1: What is YouTube Timestamp Links</h2><p>In this fast-paced world where viewers have limited time at hand, YouTube Timestamp links are extremely helpful. These links are anchor text or video hyperlinks found either in the description beneath the video or at the video link end.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-timestamp-google-serp.jpg"                      alt="youtube timestamps in google serp"                ></p><p>The Timestamps links allow you to put a link to a key moment in your YouTube video allowing the viewers and subscribers to view the video at the precise time specified. Your YouTube video maybe half an hour long or maybe your users do not have the time now or forget to later watch your video, but when you add Timestamp to the YouTube link, you provide them ways to get to the content quickly enhancing the user experience.</p><p>In addition to this, you can even provide a reference in minutes and hours where necessary. The YouTube Timestamp link acts as a guide that directs viewers to the part of the video, which is most relevant to them without having to watch the entire video.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Timestamp-to-YouTube-Video-Link-on-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Timestamp-to-YouTube-Video-Link-on-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Timestamp to YouTube Video Link on Desktop?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Timestamp to YouTube Video Link on Desktop?</h2><p>In the following section, I will show you how to add timestamp to YouTube video link in several ways.</p><p><strong>Use YouTube’s Share Feature</strong></p><p>Using YouTube’s share feature is the simplest way to add Timestamp to YouTube videos. Here are easy steps to follow to do this.</p><ol><li>Open the YouTube video on your desktop that you want to share.</li><li>Play the video or navigate the timeline and stop at the key moment you wish to apply the timestamp to.</li><li>Now click on the Share button, a pop-up will appear.

Follow the step-by-step guide below to add a Timestamp manually.</p><ol><li>Open your YouTube video in a browser on your desktop and then find the URL in the browser’s address bar.</li><li>Enter the specific time you want the viewers to watch the video from at the end of the video URL.</li></ol><p>You can add time manually in two ways depending on the URL.</p><p>?t&#x3D;As or</p><p>&amp;t&#x3D;As</p><p><strong>“youtu.be&#x2F;” Format</strong></p><p>If your YouTube video link is a youtu.be format, then just add ?t&#x3D;As at the end of the video link. The A denotes the seconds at which you want the viewer to watch your video. The time can also be specified in minutes and seconds and when you want to do that just add ?t&#x3D;AmBs. For instance, ?t&#x3D;2m40s.</p><p><strong>“youtube.com&#x2F;” Format</strong></p><p>When your YouTube video link has a youtube.com format, the adjustment starts with an ampersand. &amp;t&#x3D;As or &amp;t&#x3D;AmBs is what you can use. If you are looking to add the Timestamp at 2m40s, just add “&amp;t&#x3D;2m40s at the end of the video URL.</p><p>Whenever anybody uses the URL with Timestamp, the video will start from the specified time.</p><p>However, when adding a Timestamp manually, always leave include whole numbers. For example, if the time starts at 4m, use 4 and not 04.</p><p><strong>Copy video URL at current time</strong></p><p>You can use YouTube’s built-in feature to share the key parts of your YouTube video.

On the lookout for the fast and quickest way for plunging most of them might opt for <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2737059?hl=en" >MCN <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (multi-channel network).</p><p>This is a technical term involving the collaboration between different YouTube channel owners. Before delving deeper into MCN YouTube, you need to have a second opinion about everything related to MCN.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: What is YouTube MCN (multi-channel network)</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: What can I get from joining MCN YouTube network</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: Cons of joining MCN YouTube network</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-YouTube-MCN-multi-channel-network"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-YouTube-MCN-multi-channel-network" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is YouTube MCN (multi-channel network)"></a>Part 1: What is YouTube MCN (multi-channel network)</h2><p>If you are curious to learn more about what exactly MCN in YouTube is all about, then here it is. Sometimes multiple YouTube channels collaborate to form a network and they rigorously work together to gain more exposure and revenues.</p><p>They share various tools and assist each other in channel management and charge a specific percentage of the revenue generated out of the partner channels. They promote each other through the network and split the generated revenue.</p><p>In most cases it is a win-win deal for both the YouTube channels, as their popularity and reach is enhanced due to the network. The ultimate goal of these MCNs is to grow the audience base, enhance earnings and support&#x2F;assist each other to flourish together.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-I-get-from-joining-MCN-YouTube-network"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-I-get-from-joining-MCN-YouTube-network" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can I get from joining MCN YouTube network?"></a>Part 2: What can I get from joining MCN YouTube network?</h2><p>The offerings from MCN YouTube are aplenty. When everything is managed properly, the profits increase and you get better exposure beyond your usual audience. But, care must be taken while choosing the network you want to join and collaborate with. Here are the things that you can expect from a successful MCN collaboration.</p><h3 id="1-Broad-market"><a href="#1-Broad-market" class="headerlink" title="1. Broad market"></a>1. Broad market</h3><p>Growing from the scratch and reaching a wide audience in YouTube is usually tough as it involves lots of effort and time. Content distribution is the key to get more publicity among the potential consumers. Forums, social media, and websites are different ways for content sharing but it is a rough path when travelled alone. With MCN YouTube, you will get a dedicated team to help you out in this regard.</p><p>Your business will stand out when your personal branding is strong enough. With YouTube MCN you can easily build your brand and market the content to a larger viewer base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/broad-market.JPG"                      alt="broad market MCN YouTube"                ></p><h3 id="2-Digital-rights-protection"><a href="#2-Digital-rights-protection" class="headerlink" title="2. Digital rights protection"></a>2. Digital rights protection</h3><p>The functioning of a YouTube MCN is not only restricted to revenue generation or brand promotion. They also take care of your channel, when you face copyright strikes that otherwise results in losing money and other advanced YouTube features. The MCN handles the copyright management issues, while you concentrate on creating engaging and valuable content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/digital-rights-protectation.JPG"                      alt="digital rights protectation"                ></p><h3 id="3-Collaborations-with-other-YouTubers"><a href="#3-Collaborations-with-other-YouTubers" class="headerlink" title="3. Collaborations with other YouTubers"></a>3. Collaborations with other YouTubers</h3><p>These MCNs allow you to collaborate with other YouTube channels and enhance your business exposure. In such a case you getter better foothold in the YouTube network, as other YouTubers in your network share the videos within the community and allow it to get more views. When such a larger audience is consuming your content, there are higher chances of getting the best out of MCN.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/collaboration.JPG"                      alt="collaboration"                ></p><h3 id="4-Better-video-production-facilities"><a href="#4-Better-video-production-facilities" class="headerlink" title="4. Better video production facilities"></a>4. Better video production facilities</h3><p>When you are a beginner, you mostly run with a limited resource in terms of budget and equipment. These MCNs ensure that you get the tools and technology like studio equipment to create and edit videos. Top-notch post-production tools are also available with them to boost your channel’s videos.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Cons-of-joining-MCN-YouTube-network"><a href="#Part-3-Cons-of-joining-MCN-YouTube-network" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Cons of joining MCN YouTube network"></a>Part 3: Cons of joining MCN YouTube network</h2><p>You should never ignore the downside of every step you take while grooming your YouTube channel to touch the heights of success. Here are few of the prominent drawbacks of joining any MCN YouTube network.</p><h3 id="1-Split-revenue"><a href="#1-Split-revenue" class="headerlink" title="1. Split revenue"></a>1. Split revenue</h3><p>Although, YouTube clearly doesn’t mention the revenue you will generate from your YouTube channel under the YouTube partner agreement. Your channel and YouTube respectively share 55&#x2F;45 revenue. When you take help from your MCN the 55% earnings will further deteriorate after paying a percentage of your AdSense revenue to them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/revenue.JPG"                      alt="revenue"                ></p><h3 id="2-Outcome-is-not-always-exciting"><a href="#2-Outcome-is-not-always-exciting" class="headerlink" title="2. Outcome is not always exciting"></a>2. Outcome is not always exciting</h3><p>If you are thinking that the viewership will jump up multi-fold after involving a MCN, then you need to hold on and rethink. It is not guaranteed that a MCN will always end up giving you more view and subscribers to your channel, though it happens with some people.</p><p>Go through what you will be gaining from the YouTube MCN in terms of promoting your videos, promotional offers and increasing the subscriber as well as boosting your channel’s exposure.</p><p>Any MCN won’t guarantee you for achieving a specific number of subscribers or views if you join them. It’s important to work out what is important for us and for what reasons you are teaming up with that MCN.</p><p>In case there is no ROI for you with a YouTube MCN then it’s better to be on your own and try hard to enhance the reach and revenue. Without an ROI, it is futile to sacrifice your earnings in vain.</p><h2 id="The-bottom-line"><a href="#The-bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="The bottom line"></a>The bottom line</h2><p>If you are asking us that you should join a YouTube MCN, then we would recommend you that the decision lies with you. As a YouTube channel owner and content creator, you have a certain goal to achieve.</p><p>So, it’s you who needs to figure out the important steps to be taken for attaining all the short and long term goals. Weigh your options and then opt for MCNs, if their assistance and service are close to meeting your expectations with your YouTube channel.</p><p>To decide whether to go for a YouTube network partnership or not, first check what percentage of your revenue they will be charging. It’s a key constraint for deciding about the viability of the partnership. If after calculating the proposed revenue sharing you have substantial profits, then going with the MCN is worth it.</p><p>The next point is the term of the contract. Never go for contracts that stretch for a longer duration. Put more stress on the legal contracts with the help of a professional lawyer. You need to be very careful about rights, termination of contracts and the likes. Though, we won’t be elaborately explaining the legal decisions involved in officially joining any YouTube network.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-dominance-in-video-landscape-mirrorless-vs-dslr-cameras/"><u>In 2024, Dominance in Video Landscape  Mirrorless vs DSLR Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-your-youtube-presence-uncovering-the-6-key-strategies-to-boost-retention-rates/"><u>2024 Approved  Elevate Your YouTube Presence  Uncovering the 6 Key Strategies to Boost Retention Rates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-discovering-8-youtube-channels-on-the-rise-at-lightning-speed/"><u>[New] Discovering 8 YouTube Channels on the Rise at Lightning Speed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/cyberspace-celebs-top-youtube-personalities-by-views/"><u>Cyberspace Celebs  Top YouTube Personalities by Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/from-script-to-screen-the-compreeved-guide-to-youtube-video-edits/"><u>From Script to Screen  The Compreeved Guide to YouTube Video Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-engineering-echoing-edits/"><u>2024 Approved  Engineering Echoing Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/channel-creation-made-simple-youtubes-top-business-channels-listed/"><u>Channel Creation Made Simple  YouTube's Top Business Channels Listed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/best-youtube-ad-creators-for-2024/"><u>Best YouTube Ad Creators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-viewing-vr-films-and-games-on-ios/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-by-Step Guide to Viewing VR Films & Games on IOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-how-d-ai-video-games-act-more-human-than-human-for-2024/"><u>New How D AI Video Games Act More Human Than Human for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-quieting-unwanted-sounds-obs-audio-issue-fixed/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Quieting Unwanted Sounds  OBS Audio Issue Fixed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-frp-on-oneplus-ace-2-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass FRP on OnePlus Ace 2 Pro?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-6-ways-to-transfer-contacts-from-poco-x5-to-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, 6 Ways To Transfer Contacts From Poco X5 to iPhone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-reviewing-the-action-realm-with-t5s-thievery/"><u>[Updated] Reviewing the Action Realm with T5's Thievery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-compelling-options-that-are-not-tiktok-the-latest/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  5 Compelling Options That Are Not TikTok - The Latest</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-channel-cross-promotion-the-art-of-collaborative-co-stars/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Channel Cross-Promotion  The Art of Collaborative Co-Stars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-zoomjoint-reporting/"><u>[Updated] ZoomJoint Reporting</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

In this way, you do not need to worry about having YouTube installed on multiple devices. You can use the app on either one of these devices in the most efficient manner. In fact, you can choose which account you are going to use, should you have multiple Google accounts and hence multiple YouTube accounts.</p><h4 id="2-Rich-resources"><a href="#2-Rich-resources" class="headerlink" title="2.Rich resources"></a>2.Rich resources</h4><p> When you upload videos from the app, you can apply music or special filters to make the most of their looks.

You can apply a plethora of different filters, which will offer you the chance to better control the final outcome. By constantly previewing the video, you have total control over what your video is going to look like in the end.

This means that you can still listen to the song and run your search using the app. The feature can be proven exceptionally practical to many people who have been used to interrupting their music for the sake of another search.</p><p> With an equally cool feature, you can combine the amazing nature of the YouTube app for iPhone or Android along with your new Smart TV. There is a special command on the menu of your app that enables you to watch the videos on your TV. So this will give you the opportunity to enjoy high-quality music on a much bigger screen.</p><p> Last but not least, you can always use the Watch Later button to catch up on videos that you do not have the time to enjoy right away. Whether you have already started watching them and turn out to take longer than expected or you have not checked them out yet, you can add them to your watch list and ensure they are ready when you need them.</p><p> YouTube app for Android and YouTube app for iPhone can truly help you out a lot. There are multiple features that improve your user experience and assist you to optimize the videos you are uploading. You can benefit from many different features and music applied to your original video, while you can also enjoy great features adding to the convenience when watching videos.

This article will inform you about all the things you want to know about <strong>AV1 Youtube</strong> settings. I will let you know the tutorial to turn in AV1 settings on YouTube and the reason why should choose AV1 along with the others, and some more things about AV1.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="av1 logo"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-turn-on-AV1-settings-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-turn-on-AV1-settings-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to turn on AV1 settings on YouTube?"></a>Part 1: How to turn on AV1 settings on YouTube?</h2><p>Do you wonder how to turn on <strong>AV1 settings on YouTube</strong>? For your information, AV1 is a video codec that is developed by a consortium of companies. It offers you advanced compression, enabling you to do smoother HD streaming and data savings for the video. Google also has already implemented AV1 use on YouTube. To turn on AV1 settings on YouTube, here are the steps:</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance"><a href="#Step1Go-to-playback-and-performance" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to playback and performance"></a>Step1Go to playback and performance</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube settings"                ></p><ul><li>To turn on the AV1 settings, go to your YouTube account, after that click “Playback and Performance”.</li><li>In the AV1 settings. Besides “Auto (Recommended)”, there are other two options, which are “Prefer AV1 for SD” and also “Always prefer SD”.</li><li>“Always Prefer AV1” uses the codec whenever it is available for a video while “Prefer AV1 for SD” limits it to SD videos. There are two options to avoid low-performance devices when AV1 videos are played on YouTube. You can select “Always Prefer AV1” to see if your device performance is good enough when you play videos on YouTube that support AV1.</li></ul><h5 id="Step2Test-if-the-AV1-settings-are-already-enabled-in-your-video"><a href="#Step2Test-if-the-AV1-settings-are-already-enabled-in-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Step2Test if the AV1 settings are already enabled in your video"></a>Step2Test if the AV1 settings are already enabled in your video</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="av1 settings"                ></p><p>You may ask how to confirm your YouTube videos are playing with AV1 Codec. Well, you can search playlist on YouTube with the keywords “<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJRxnLlXbB0ETtMprpLypZs68duRS1t1" >4K, 5K, and 8K videos with the new AV1 Codec <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“. You can test it by playing one of the videos. You have to right-click on the media player and then select “Stats for nerd”. If it shows the av01 codec there, then the AV1 settings are enabled already.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Why-choose-AV1-over-VP9-and-other-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?"></a>Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?</h2><p>Now, do you need a reason why you should choose AV1 compared to VP9 and the others? As you know, there is also another video codec like VP9. There are also the others such as VVC, and many more. So what is the superiority of AV1 over the others? I will let you know why you should choose AV1 in this part.</p><p>The main thing is, as mentioned before, AV1 is developed by a consortium of companies founded in 2015. It is supported by The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and also by web browser developers and semiconductor firms. Aomedia made it clear the algorithm is free-to-use. It means that there are no greedy negotiators that will be dependent on the developers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-4.jpg"                      alt="giant techs behind av1"                ></p><p>Also, these days, with a format that provides a much smaller workload for internet providers. Their today focus is, that AV1 can reach the quality but can get the job done with 20% more efficiency. Then, with AV1 encoding, a “standard” 4K movie will be much more accessible than it is now. These are some more reasons why you should choose AV1.</p><h3 id="1-Royalty-free"><a href="#1-Royalty-free" class="headerlink" title="1. Royalty-free"></a>1. Royalty-free</h3><p>As mentioned before, AV1 is royalty-free. AV1 is such a next-generation of royalty video codec. It means that it is not just free to use, but also free of charge, obligations, or even liability. It is an open and royalty-free video codec that the video platform will not charge to pay royalties to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the developer of video codecs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-5.jpg"                      alt="av1 is royalty-free"                ></p><p>When it comes to the group that will ask for the royalty, MPEG is not the only one. There are also other patent groups and companies that can ask for it. Aomedia integrated Google, Mozilla, and Cisco, while they were busy creating their new video codec. However, the three companies joined together to create one codec to beat them all.</p><h3 id="2-Better-performance"><a href="#2-Better-performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Better performance"></a>2. Better performance</h3><p>It is said that the AV1 codec is 30% more efficient. According to the tests conducted by Moscow State University, AV1 can outperform AV1 by about 28% in the efficiency of encoding and decoding. As per the performance graph from the Graphics &amp; Media Lab Video Group, MSU below, AV1 can offer the exactly same quality as X264 at 55% of the average bitrate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-6.jpg"                      alt="av1 benefit"                ></p><p>AV1 is designed so exclusively to function better than all the other codecs in the market. It is an open-sourced codec with simple patent licensing, and the integration manages to save, as mentioned, up to 30% of the bandwidth for the exactly same image quality. In other words, with AV1, distributors can send streams much faster and cheaper and we can enjoy higher definitions in the same bandwidth.</p><h3 id="3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future"><a href="#3-AV2-to-come-in-the-future" class="headerlink" title="3. AV2 to come in the future"></a>3. AV2 to come in the future</h3><p>AV1 is undoubtedly superior if we compare it to other available video codecs and the exploration of the codec technology AV2 has already begun. This is such an early performance evaluation. There is some interesting part of the exploration development of AV2, such as multiple line selection for Intra prediction can make you select not just neighboring row&#x2F;column for directional prediction. The same tool also exists in VVC.</p><p>There are also three essential improvements, which are simplifying the existing feature (also complete removal) and picking the tool used by VVC&#x2F;H.266 (It is lack originality but so much work on it) and improvement periodically improvement of an existing tool, it is too few and also not original. We haven’t known yet when AV2 will be done completely though, maybe there still be some more essential improvements.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format"><a href="#Part-3-What’s-the-best-video-editor-for-YouTubers-with-AV1-format" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?"></a>Part 3: What’s the best video editor for YouTubers with AV1 format?</h2><p>When we talk about YouTube, it feels incomplete if we don’t talk about the video editor.

There’s nothing to get nervous about when you have expert tips on how to shoot a perfect makeup tutorial:</p><ol><li>Make sure you sit facing a window from where the sun is shining through so that it provides a soft natural glow to your face.</li><li>Ensure there’s a continuous stream of light, which hardly flickers or distorts. Set up a ring light to mimic the natural light.</li><li>To justify the colors of your work and make them pop on your skin, surround yourself with LED luminosity attached with reflectors to disperse the rays evenly throughout the room. This shall keep away the shadows from swallowing you.</li><li>Assure quality audio by upgrading to camera mics or simply switch to a reliable audio software for getting the work done.</li><li>Edit out the awkward moments from the shoot, add interesting transitions and effects by narrowing down to a reliable video editing software. Filmora can be a wonderful tool to fine-tune your video, add endless effects, remove background noise (if any) and provide you with full 4K support.

That’s pretty common.</p><p>If you have a DSLR then you can set it down on any stable surface while filming yourself, but your phone can’t stand up by itself. It needs something or someone to hold it. Do you just accept that and shoot everything as a selfie?</p><p>No. No, you don’t, because there are common household items that can help you out of this problem. For this DIY tripod, you need either <strong>2 binder clips</strong> or <strong>2 ‘claw clips’</strong> (also called ‘hair jaws’).</p><p>Hold your phone in landscape mode (horizontally, so it’s long rather than tall) and attach clips to the bottom corners. If you are worried about scratching your screen, fold up some paper to place between your clip and your phone.</p><p>Here it is with binder clips:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/binder-clips.jpg"                      alt="binder clips"                ></p><p>And here it is with hair clips:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hair-clips.jpg"                      alt="hair clips"                ></p><p>Now you can set your smartphone upon any stable surface, like a table or a stack of books.</p><p> <em>Here are some more cool ideas!</em></p><h3 id="DIY-adjustable-tripod-using-books-and-a-towel-3"><a href="#DIY-adjustable-tripod-using-books-and-a-towel-3" class="headerlink" title="DIY adjustable tripod using books and a towel"></a><strong>DIY adjustable tripod using books and a towel</strong></h3><p>You’ve probably heard a million times that you can stabilize your camera by sitting it down on any stable surface – on your desk, on a stack of books, up in a tree, etc. This is very true!</p><p>But if you can use any stable surface, why do people buy tripods?</p><p>Because it isn’t convenient to rearrange your furniture whenever you want to make a video, and also because tripods are adjustable. You can change their height, you can use them to pan or tilt, and it’s pretty easy to move them a bit forwards or backward while you’re setting up your shot.</p><p>To get similar functions from the ‘any stable surface’ solution you can use a <strong>table</strong>, a <strong>stack of books</strong>, and a <strong>towel</strong>.</p><ol><li>Set up the area where you’re going to sit while you’re filming on one end of the table.</li><li>Put the towel down over the approximate spot you want your camera to be.</li><li>Stack your books on top of the towel.</li><li>Put your camera on top of the books.</li></ol><p>Now if your camera isn’t up high enough, or is too high, you can adjust it just by adding or taking away books. If you want to move it closer or farther away from you, just pull the towel forwards or backward.</p><h3 id="DIY-gripping-‘Gorillapod’-using-wire-and-tape-3"><a href="#DIY-gripping-‘Gorillapod’-using-wire-and-tape-3" class="headerlink" title="DIY gripping ‘Gorillapod’ using wire and tape"></a><strong>DIY gripping ‘Gorillapod’ using wire and tape</strong></h3><p>Gorillapod’s are cool because you can use them like normal tripods, carry them around like selfie sticks, or attach them to things like fences and posts. Here’s how you can make something similar using <strong>wire</strong>, <strong>electrical tape</strong> or <strong>duct tape</strong>, and a <strong>1&#x2F;4 bolt</strong>.</p><p>Your wire should be fairly stiff and you’ll need three pieces the same length, which should be at least 10 inches. Old clothes hangers work well. This needs to be something strong enough to support the weight of your camera, but soft enough that it’s not impossible for you to bend.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wire-and-type.jpg"                      alt="wire and type"                ></p><p><em>All of your supplies plus the finished product.</em></p><p><strong>Readying your legs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Bend 2 inches at one end of each wire into a ‘U’ shape. You will probably need pliers for this.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Pick up one of your pieces of wire and wrap one end with electrical tape. Go around 5-10 times (to prevent it from coming undone at the end) and then, without cutting your tape, start moving up and wrapping the rest of your wire. Stop before your ‘U’ section.</p><p>Repeat this with the other two wires.</p><p> <strong>Attaching your legs</strong></p><p><em><strong>Step 1:</strong></em> Place the ‘U’ section of a leg against your bolt. The bolt’s threading should be pointing away from the leg. Now, use your tape to attach them. Wind it around 2 or 3 times, then repeat the process with both of the other legs individually.</p><p><em><strong>Step 2:</strong></em> After all the legs are attached, wrap some more tape around all 3 as tightly as you can.</p><p> Your camera will mount onto the bolt!
