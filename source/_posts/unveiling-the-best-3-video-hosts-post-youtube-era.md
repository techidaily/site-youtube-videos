YouTube is a great platform where almost everyone goes to watches videos. It is not the best platform for every video creator, though. This article will introduce you to some YouTube alternatives.

There are a lot of reasons you might want to learn about other websites like YouTube. You might want a site with less ads, or different ways of monetizing. YouTube can sometimes remove videos unfairly, so you may want a site where copyright claims are handled by people instead of robots. A lot of users simply want a site that is more like YouTube was when it was younger. There are features, like customizable channel pages, which have been discarded over the years.

## YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites

Here is a list of other places where you can upload videos:

#### 1\. Dailymotion

![YouTune Alternatives - Dailymotion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-dailymotion.JPG)

This may be the second most popular free video sharing website, and it is very similar to YouTube in appearance. Like YouTube, Dailymotion recommends videos to users based on what is trending as well as their personal viewing habits. Also like YouTube, there are ads in and around videos and you have the option of monetizing your content to earn ad revenue. There is more than one way to become a Dailymotion partner, though. You can sell a subscription for your channel instead of monetizing ads in your videos.

The main difference between Dailymotion and YouTube is that where YouTube has an abundance of both amateur and professional quality video, Dailymotion skews towards professional. There are personal vlogs and cat videos, but these are less the norm on Dailymotion than on YouTube. You may find less competition in your genre here. However, you should be aware that the expectations of viewers might be higher.

#### 2\. Vimeo

![YouTube Alternatives - Vimeo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternative-vimeo.JPG)

Although Vimeo is also a very popular video site, it is very different from YouTube. Everything from appearance to the types of comments left on videos is vastly different. The front page of this site does not display trending videos, for example. Instead it features high quality creative content that has been reviewed and singled out by Vimeo’s staff as some of the best the site has to offer.

There also are not any ads on Vimeo, whereas YouTube is full of them.

If you create, or are interested in creating, short films then this is where you should be posting. Many festival quality shorts are posted to Vimeo. There are vlogs there too, but they tend to be by serious video creators. The community on Vimeo tends to be a lot friendlier than YouTube so if you are still an amateur, but have dreams of being a pro, then this is probably still the site for you. You should be able to find real constructive criticism here rather than trolls.

Vimeo has a wider variety of privacy settings than YouTube. You can make videos watchable by everyone, just certain people, or require a password.

#### 3\. ZippCast

![YouTune Alternatives - ZippCast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-zippcast.JPG)

ZippCast is praised by some for being very similar to pre-Google YouTube. While the expectations for video quality may be slightly higher on DailyMotion than YouTube, and are much higher on Vimeo, they are basically the same on ZippCast. Comedy, gaming, music, animation, and vlogging are the most popular categories and almost all content is posted by average people with average skill levels. One of the ways in which ZippCast is like the ‘old’ YouTube is that you can customize the design of your channel.

One of the things users appreciate most about ZippCast is that identifying and removing copyrighted videos is done by humans rather than an automated system, like on YouTube. This means that if you use copyrighted content that is licensed to you or protected by fair use your video should not be taken down. It is common for YouTubers to have their videos unfairly removed, although disputing the copyright claim will usually result in getting the video restored.

Although it is definitely large enough to be considered an alternative to YouTube, ZippCast has been unreliable in the past (i.e shutting down randomly) and has lost the trust of many users.

## Part 1\. How to Get Monetized on YouTube: Rules and Requirements

### How to Monetize YouTube Channel

Begin making money from your YouTube videos through the YouTube Partner Program. You can create earnings from your YouTube channel by connecting it to your Google account. Monetize your website using Google AdSense.

Google AdSense generates substantial website revenue. If viewers interact with the ads in your videos, you earn money. Adding AdSense to your YouTube channel makes your videos monetizable.

Some videos cannot be monetized, however. Content must meet specific requirements to qualify for YouTube's program. Criteria include content quality, community guidelines, and copyright compliance. Your YouTube channel can generate income once your videos meet these standards.

![youTube partner Program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/2023-YouTube-Monetization-Mastery-How-to-Monetize-YouTube-Videos-1.JPG)

### Monetizing YouTube Videos: What Are The Requirements?

You can monetize your YouTube videos by joining the YouTube Partner Program. Everyone can create a YouTube account, but YPP requires certain requirements. Every time you create content, you must consider these requirements.

Prior to applying for the program, your channel must first accomplish the following:

* One thousand subscribers
* A total of 4,000 watch hours in the past year

Building your audience and creating great content will help you meet these requirements. Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube's rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.

Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.

When you upload content to YouTube, you'll need to keep these things in mind. Those who plan on monetizing their videos should thoroughly read these documents. You also need to set up a Google AdSense account, which tracks and pays for your YouTube ads.

## Part 2\. 10 Proven Ways to Monetize Your YouTube Channel

### 10 Methods to Monetize YouTube Videos

You can monetize your YouTube videos in 10 different ways, including:

* [Google Adsense](#filmora1)
* [Paid Sponsorship](#filmora2)
* [YouTube Premium](#filmora3)
* [Memberships](#filmora4)
* [Merchandise](#filmora5)
* [Invest in crowd-funding](#filmora6)
* [Stickers, chats, and thanks](#filmora7)
* [YouTube Shorts](#filmora8)
* [YouTube Brandconnect](#filmora9)
* [YouTube Shopping](#filmora10)

### 1\. Google AdSense

YouTube channel monetization is the most popular method. By adding AdSense to your videos, you can generate revenue from the ads displayed. You must adhere to our advertiser-friendly guidelines when creating your videos. The monetization of all videos may not be possible, therefore. YouTube and AdSense work seamlessly together. With no technical knowledge required, your monetization strategy can be set up and managed easily.

![ Google Adsense](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/2023-YouTube-Monetization-Mastery-How-to-Monetize-YouTube-Videos-3.JPG)

### 2\. Paid Sponsorships

Sponsorship involves paying a content creator to use, demonstrate, or test a brand's product in a video. Both the creator and the brand benefit from sponsorships provided by brands.

The rewards of sponsorship can be immense, but sponsorships are hard to come by. You can pitch relevant brands to partner with your influential channel if your channel has a large following.

![paid sponsorship](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/2023-YouTube-Monetization-Mastery-How-to-Monetize-YouTube-Videos-4.jpg)

### 3\. YouTube Premium

Joining the YouTube Partner Program qualifies you for YouTube Premium. In addition, it can increase your earnings. YouTube Premium members get paid when they watch your content as a creator. The number of Premium members has now surpassed 20 million. It is possible that this may occur quite frequently. YouTube Premium will automatically pay you if someone watches your content.

![youTube premium](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/2023-YouTube-Monetization-Mastery-How-to-Monetize-YouTube-Videos-5.jpg)

### 4\. Memberships

Creating membership tiers on your channel allows you to offer different perks to different levels of subscription. Using memberships has the main benefit of providing a more steady income stream. Ad revenue is a more traditional method of monetization. This feature is enabled by channels with at least 1,000 subscribers, and the creator sets fees.

![channel memebership](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/2023-YouTube-Monetization-Mastery-How-to-Monetize-YouTube-Videos-6.JPG)

### 5\. Merchandise

You can sell merchandise on YouTube videos with over 10,000 subscribers using a merch shelf. By selling branded merchandise to your YouTube fans, you can generate additional revenue.

It's especially useful for YouTube creators without their own website who want to sell merchandise. Currently, there are over 45 platforms or retailers worldwide that support merch, so growing your brand is easy.

### 6\. Invest in crowd-funding

It's not just for startups anymore; you can use crowdfunding to fund content creation on YouTube as well. You can find people to support your work through third-party applications like Patreon in exchange for perks. You can now place sponsor buttons on your YouTube videos, which allows you to crowdfund. With this, you can offer rewards in exchange for monthly funding like with Patreon.

### 7\. Stickers, chats, and thanks

During live streams and premieres, creators can engage their fans with Super Chat and Super Stickers. In the live chat, fans can purchase Super Chats to display their message prominently. A Super Sticker is an animated image displayed during a live chat session. The Super Thanks feature enables creators to earn income from their videos. Additional appreciation may be expressed by those who wish to do so

### 8\. YouTube Shorts

Using the YouTube app, short, vertical videos can be uploaded straight to YouTube using a smartphone. In the same way as Instagram Stories are uploaded to the social media site. The length of YouTube shorts is limited to 60 seconds. In 2021 and 2022, a $100 million fund will be distributed for YouTube Shorts. With this initial stage, YouTube Shorts began to monetize in May 2021\. A YouTube Short will only be compensated if it meets the fund's criteria.

![youtube shorts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/2023-YouTube-Monetization-Mastery-How-to-Monetize-YouTube-Videos-7.JPG)

### 9\. YouTube BrandConnect

Brands and YouTube creators can work together on content campaigns through YouTube BrandConnect. In terms of product recommendations, audiences trust creators. It is also possible to partner with YouTube channels through BrandConnect

### 10\. YouTube Shopping

YouTube shopping gives you the chance to promote your own products or those of other brands. It is possible to connect your store (such as Shopify) to YouTube. Add your products to videos, shorts, live streams, etc., as well as tag other brands' products.

### Monetizing YouTube Videos: What Are The Requirements?

You can monetize your YouTube videos by joining the YouTube Partner Program. Everyone can create a YouTube account, but YPP requires certain requirements. Every time you create content, you must consider these requirements.

Prior to applying for the program, your channel must first accomplish the following:

* One thousand subscribers
* A total of 4,000 watch hours in the past year

Building your audience and creating great content will help you meet these requirements. Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube's rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.

Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.

When you upload content to YouTube, you'll need to keep these things in mind. Those who plan on monetizing their videos should thoroughly read these documents. You also need to set up a Google AdSense account, which tracks and pays for your YouTube ads.
