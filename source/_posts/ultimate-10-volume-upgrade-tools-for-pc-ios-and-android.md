## Recording Screencast Video with YouTube

Step 1: Open YouTube on your computer and sign by using your Google Account. On the top left corner, you will find the Upload button, press it and go to live streaming section and choose events from the drop-down menu. When you are doing this for the very first time, YouTube will ask your phone number to verify the streaming process. You can also click [here to get to the Livestreaming page directly.](https://www.youtube.com/live%5Fdashboard)

Step 2: On the create an event page, add a title for your screencast video; set privacy terms and then hit “Go Live Now” option.
