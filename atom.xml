Plus, it is an easy way to disguise the room you are vlogging from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-blur01.JPG"                      alt="how to blur01"                ></p><p>Even if your set is clean, there could be things like books behind you, which will distract viewers; they will be trying to read the spines. Blurring out the background of your shot makes your video look polished and keeps people’s focus entirely on you.</p><ul><li><a href="#blur_background_in_video_shooting">Part 1: Blur YouTube Video Background in Shooting Videos</a></li><li><a href="#blur_background_in_video_editing">Part 2: Add Tilt-Shift Effects to Video in Editing</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-of-Your-YouTube-Video-in-Shooting-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-of-Your-YouTube-Video-in-Shooting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos"></a>Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos</h2><p>Blurring your background is also how you create a beautiful bokeh lighting effect. Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh" class="headerlink" title="1. Blurring and Bokeh"></a>1. Blurring and Bokeh</h4><p>Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.<br>To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Blur-your-Background"><a href="#2-How-to-Blur-your-Background" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Blur your Background"></a>2. How to Blur your Background</h4><p>Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.</p><p>If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.</p><p>To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f&#x2F;3 or f&#x2F;4 can also work.</p><p>Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject&#x2F;depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.</p><h2 id="Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Blur Video Background in Post-Production with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production. Here, I will show you how to do that in Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers. Its user-friendly interface and tutorial guide enables green-hands to start video editing quickly. Besides, you can find many free filters, effects, and elements pre-programmed, so you can use them directly without looking for presets and templates somewhere else.</p><h3 id="1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora"><a href="#1-Add-Bokeh-Filter-to-Video-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Add Bokeh Filter to Video in Filmora"></a>1. Add Bokeh Filter to Video in Filmora</h3><p>There are about 20 bokeh effects available in filters and overlays. You can find them easily by typing bokeh in the search bar in Effects.</p><p>Note: you should select <strong>Included</strong> to see all bokeh effects pre-programmed in Filmora. If you need more visual effects, just go to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >the Filmstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> effects store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-bokeh-effect.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Bokeh effect "                ></p><p>Double click the bokeh effect to preview the result, and if you find the bokeh effect fits the video, just drop it to the track above the video. And the bokeh filter or overlay will be applied to the video automatically.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Tilt-Shift-Circle-Linear-Effect-to-Blur-Video-Background"><a href="#2-Use-Tilt-Shift-Circle-Linear-Effect-to-Blur-Video-Background" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Tilt-Shift Circle&#x2F;Linear Effect to Blur Video Background"></a>2. Use Tilt-Shift Circle&#x2F;Linear Effect to Blur Video Background</h3><p>Filmora features two tilt effects, tilt-shift circle and tilt-shift linear, which allows you to highlight people in the video, blur, and conceal the video background.</p><p>Go to the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and then switch to the <strong>Utility</strong> menu under <strong>Included</strong> category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tilt-shift-effects.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Tilt-Shift effects "                ></p><p>Here, I will select the <strong>Tilt-Shift Circle</strong> effect and drop it to the track above the video. Now, you can adjust the size, position, and intensity of the tilt-shift circle effect</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-tilt-shift-circle-effect.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Tilt-Shift Circle effect"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134241/18498" target="_top" id="2134241">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134241" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134241/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You see, the video background is blurred, and the people are highlighted.

There is still the question if the YouTube Video Editor is good, and if it replaces desktop editors. Hopefully, our YouTube Video Editor Review helps you figure out if you want to use the editor.</p><hr><p>Want to make your YouTube video more attractive and beautiful? here I recommend an easy-to-use video editing software - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which not only allows you cut, crop, rotate, and split your videos in minutes, but also simplify the advanced video editing like green screen effect and PIP. You can also find over 300 video effects like Fashion, Beauty, Gaming, Education, etc.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><hr><h2 id="YouTube-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Editor Review"></a>YouTube Video Editor Review</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong> From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite.

Now the YouTube video editor is able to add video effects to the video and create multiple projects at the same time. While the editor can do more, it has stayed a simple tool.</p><p>This simplicity makes it very easy and quick to use. Unlike desktop editors, the YouTube Editor processes much faster. Since the tool is designed to be easy to use, you can learn to use the YouTube Editor in very little time. However, due to its simplicity, it does not offer all the same features. Some of the features that are missing means that it is not suited for every project.</p><h4 id="The-Basic-Features"><a href="#The-Basic-Features" class="headerlink" title="The Basic Features"></a><strong>The Basic Features</strong></h4><h4 id="1-The-editor"><a href="#1-The-editor" class="headerlink" title="1.The editor"></a>1.The editor</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-6.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Video Editor review and guide"                ></p><p>The YouTube Video Editor does come with some standard video editing functions like video splicing, Audioswap, and cropping videos. The video editor needs to have the videos already uploaded to YouTube. Along with using your own videos, you have the option to use videos that are part of the Creative Commons library. There transitions, and other features that other standard video editors have. Audioswap is easy to use, and there is access to the Creative Commons library in the editor.</p><h4 id="2-The-Enhancements"><a href="#2-The-Enhancements" class="headerlink" title="2.

Enhancements can be found by clicking on a video picture after it has been added to the project. Enhancements are broken into four categories: Quick Fixes, Filters, Text, and Audio. Quick fixes are basic adjustments for small issues like the contrast and saturation of the video. YouTube added an auto-fix button and stabilize video button to make it quick to fix these issues. The filters, text, and audio, are about the same that you would find with any other video editing software.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Want to know how to use the Enhancements feature in YouTube?

It is also super easy to learn. If you have a Google+ account, you can photos to your video straight from your cloud storage. You also have access to all the videos that you have uploaded to YouTube.

I learned from those mistakes and have helped many new YouTubers start their own channels. Here is a list of eight common mistakes that new YouTubers should avoid, along with tips to do things in a better way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-new-youtuber.jpg"                      alt="Mistakes To Avoid As a New YouTuber"                ></p><h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><h3 id="1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision"><a href="#1-Failing-to-have-a-long-term-vision" class="headerlink" title="1. Failing to have a long-term vision"></a>1. Failing to have a long-term vision</h3><p>One common mistake that a lot of new YouTubers make is failing to have a long-term vision. Without a long-term vision, you’re more likely to poorly brand your YouTube channel, drop your YouTube channel activity in busier times, and, midway through, change the type of content you create and upload. None of these are good for your channel!</p><p>If you can think of the kind of content you’ll love to consistently create and share in the long-run, you’ll not only be able to narrow down your brand and effectively communicate to your audience who you are and what your channel is all about, but you’ll also have a better idea on what to put out next.</p><h3 id="2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL"><a href="#2-Choosing-an-ineffective-custom-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL"></a>2. Choosing an ineffective custom URL</h3><p>Another mistake I made with my first YouTube channel was choosing an ineffective custom URL. Because my last name is Kim, I wanted to make my custom URL “YouTube.com&#x2F;kimagination.” But it wasn’t available. So, I took “kimaginati0n” with a zero where the “o” should be. I thought it was a good idea back then but it was a terrible idea.</p><p>Choose a custom URL with words that can’t be confused with other similar-sounding words. For consistency across all your different social media accounts, try to choose a custom URL that matches the usernames of all your other social media channels. If the username you want isn’t available, then keep on trying to come up with a good name that is available. When you’ve secured the same username across all your different social media channels, you can then very simply promote yourself and all your social media channels by displaying just the social media icons followed by your one username.</p><h3 id="3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched"><a href="#3-Coming-up-with-titles-that-won’t-get-searched" class="headerlink" title="3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched"></a>3. Coming up with titles that won’t get searched</h3><p>Many new YouTubers make the mistake of titling their videos in an ineffective way. Rather than coming up with titles that more people might search, they either come up with titles that summarize what the video is about as a whole or title their videos the way big YouTubers do.</p><p>Big YouTubers can take advantage of non-searched, curiosity evoking titles like “You won’t believe what just happened…” because they already have a huge following. Their channels aren’t depending on getting discovered through search. But yours is. So come up with titles that people are actually searching.</p><p>As an example, let’s suppose you vlogged your time backpacking around Europe last summer. Don’t title your YouTube video “My Summer Backpacking Trip.” Instead, title it “Going Up The Eiffel Tower | Beautiful View of Paris!” This way, all the people who are curious about visiting Paris, the Eiffel Tower, and seeing what the view is like from the top of the Eiffel Tower might find your video.</p><h3 id="4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy"><a href="#4-Failing-to-have-a-thumbnail-strategy" class="headerlink" title="4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy"></a>4. Failing to have a thumbnail strategy</h3><p>New YouTubers tend to think about their thumbnail images after they’ve finished editing their videos together. This is way too late in the process for something that is so incredibly important in getting views.</p><p>Even before filming, you should think about how you’re going to title your video to get the most views. After that, you should then try to picture, in your head, a thumbnail image that matches your title and creates curiosity and excitement. When you go into filming, you can then make sure to include some footage of you recreating that image.</p><h3 id="5-Making-weak-intros"><a href="#5-Making-weak-intros" class="headerlink" title="5. Making weak intros"></a>5. Making weak intros</h3><p>After you’ve managed to get someone to click on your video through your effective title and thumbnail image strategy, the next challenge is to keep that person watching your video without closing it too early. A typical viewer on YouTube decides within the first ten to fifteen seconds of landing on a video whether or not he or she will stay or leave. This short window of time is so important to set the tone of the rest of your video and build excitement and curiosity in your viewer with an effective, high-energy intro.</p><p>New YouTubers often make the mistake of having weak intros. Starting at the beginning of a story makes sense, right? The beginning, however, is not always the most exciting. Consequently, new YouTubers lose their audience’s attention too early on.</p><p>To read more on how some of the most successful YouTubers effectively do their intros, check out my blogpost on “<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How To Edit YouTube Videos Like a YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.”</p><h3 id="6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers"><a href="#6-Forgetting-to-engage-with-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers"></a>6. Forgetting to engage with subscribers</h3><p>An important thing to do as a new YouTuber is engaging with your subscribers. Some new YouTubers, though, are so focused and busy with the production side of things that they forget to do the community side of things, including responding to comments. By not responding to comments as a new YouTuber, you hurt your potential to get more comments consistently from your subscribers. If your video’s comments section is very active, YouTube ranks your video higher in the videos it recommends to viewers.</p><p>Connecting with your audience shouldn’t just be limited to YouTube either. Use your other social media channels to connect with your audience as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134502/19576" target="_top" id="2134502">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134502" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="672" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134502/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Not-promoting-with-social-media"><a href="#7-Not-promoting-with-social-media" class="headerlink" title="7. Not promoting with social media"></a>7. Not promoting with social media</h3><p>YouTube isn’t the only social media platform that people are spending their time on. People are spending their time on all kinds of different social media platforms, like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The more content in all of these platforms that you create to promote your video, the more potential your video has to be seen by their users.</p><p>New YouTubers sometimes forget to promote their videos and channel using other social media platforms. Consequently, they miss out on the opportunity to get views from multiple sources of social media.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100530/7443" target="_top" id="2100530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Spamming-comments"><a href="#8-Spamming-comments" class="headerlink" title="8. Spamming comments"></a>8. Spamming comments</h3><p>Commenting on other YouTube videos is another way to get your channel discovered from people reading over comments. If your profile picture and comment appears interesting enough, out of curiosity, people just might click your username to have a look at your channel.</p><p>But rather than leaving interesting comments that are related to the video, rather than adding to the conversation, some new YouTubers desperate to get more subscribers make the mistake of spamming videos with “check out my YouTube channel!” comments.</p><p>Spam comments annoy YouTubers. It would be much more beneficial to your channel to build good relationships with other YouTubers to possibly collaborate on a video together in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-cutting-edge-editing-techniques-youtube-and-comparable-tools/"><u>[New] Cutting-Edge Editing Techniques YouTube & Comparable Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-tips-for-creating-engaging-fb-video-content/"><u>[New] Tips for Creating Engaging FB Video Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-freefire-gameplay-on-youtube-channels/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your FreeFire Gameplay on YouTube Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-elevating-your-listening-palette-with-youtube-music/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Your Listening Palette with YouTube Music</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-will-2023-see-an-increase-in-televising-video-content/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Will 2023 See an Increase in Televising Video Content?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-efficient-guide-image-conversion-to-professional-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>2024 Approved Efficient Guide Image Conversion to Professional YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-life360-shows-wrong-location-on-lenovo-thinkphone-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Fix Life360 Shows Wrong Location On Lenovo ThinkPhone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-update-apple-iphone-13-without-losing-anything-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Update Apple iPhone 13 without Losing Anything? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-tecno-pop-7-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 9 Mind-Blowing Tricks to Hatch Eggs in Pokemon Go Without Walking On Tecno Pop 7 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/thriving-on-both-sides-work-and-youtubing-tips/"><u>Thriving on Both Sides Work and YouTubing Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-s-top-music-video-makers-elevate-your-sound-with-style/"><u>Updated In 2024, S Top Music Video Makers Elevate Your Sound with Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-epic-15-rock-melodies-that-define-2023s-music-scene/"><u>Updated Unveiling the Epic 15 Rock Melodies that Define 2023S Music Scene</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Find Good Keywords for Your YouTube Videos"></a>1. Find Good Keywords for Your YouTube Videos</h2><p>The keywords that you choose to use with your video will be the greatest factors in determining whether your video will actually be found by viewers searching for content like yours on YouTube. You need to be intelligent and choose strong keywords that are highly related to both your video and your niche on YouTube. Without the use of good keywords, your video will simply become lost in the endless stream of content being uploaded to YouTube, and audiences who might enjoy it will never get a chance to see it.</p><p>Consider doing some keyword research into your video’s subject using the Google Keyword Planner in or a variety of other<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >keyword tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure the most important keywords are in your tags, title, and description.</p><h2 id="2-Make-Full-Use-of-Your-Video’s-Tags"><a href="#2-Make-Full-Use-of-Your-Video’s-Tags" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Full Use of Your Video’s Tags"></a>2. Make Full Use of Your Video’s Tags</h2><p>Tags are essential. A lot of creators either skip tags or only put in 1-5, and their actions will benefit you if you choose to use a lot.</p><p>Loading up your tags with keywords that are relevant to your video and genre will help your video appear in the viewer’s search results, which will earn you a lot more views. When users are looking for specific information, like how to recover lost data, just including things like ‘lost data’, ‘data recovery’, and even the full phrase ‘how to recover lost data’ in your video’s tags will give you a greater chance to actually appear in search engine results.</p><p>Including the maximum amount of tags possible will help to give YouTube the maximum amount of information to use in order to place your video in the results of different searches or to have it come up as ‘related’ to other videos. Users that only post 3 or 4 tags with each video could be missing out on countless amounts of traffic for their content.</p><h2 id="3-Post-a-Transcript-in-Your-Video-Description"><a href="#3-Post-a-Transcript-in-Your-Video-Description" class="headerlink" title="3. Post a Transcript in Your Video Description"></a>3. Post a Transcript in Your Video Description</h2><p>If you have a script or a transcript for your entire video you should consider posting it in the description of your video in order to improve your search engine ranking. This can also help for users that would like to have a written article to accompany your video and for indexing your video in search engine results. There are so many people that don’t make proper use of their video descriptions on YouTube that doing so will give you an advantage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105883/7443" target="_top" id="2105883">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105883" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105883/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Write-Searchable-YouTube-Video-Tiles"><a href="#4-Write-Searchable-YouTube-Video-Tiles" class="headerlink" title="4. Write Searchable YouTube Video Tiles"></a>4. Write Searchable YouTube Video Tiles</h2><p>By including your 1 or 2 most important keywords in the title of your video you will help YouTube sort your video into the correct search results. Generally, your most important keywords will be things like the name of the game you’re playing or the brand of makeup you’re reviewing.</p><p>Try to write titles that are searchable and which also get potential viewers excited about your content. Do not try to be mysterious or clickbait-y in your video title. Big channels can be very successful with those strategies because they’re already guaranteed a certain number of views, but this will almost always backfire for small channels.</p><p>Phrases such as ‘review’, ‘how-to’, and ‘tutorial’ get searched for a lot, so always include them in your titles when they apply to your videos.</p><h2 id="5-Optimize-your-Video-Description-for-YouTube-SEO"><a href="#5-Optimize-your-Video-Description-for-YouTube-SEO" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimize your Video Description for YouTube SEO"></a>5. Optimize your Video Description for YouTube SEO</h2><p>Video descriptions should generally include around 4000 characters (about 900 words) in which you describe the content of your YouTube video, include important keywords, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Using up all the space in your description is a good way to ensure you’re getting the maximum search value out of it.</p><p>If you use a lot of products in your videos (i.e. you make cooking videos, so your favorite frying pan is in a lot of shots) then it is a good idea to look into affiliate programs. Amazon has one of the best. If you become an affiliate you can post links to the products you use in your video description and, if a viewer follows one and buys something (even if it’s not the thing you liked to) you’ll earn a commission. This won’t help you with search rankings, but it’s a nice bonus.</p><h2 id="6-Use-Custom-Video-Thumbnails"><a href="#6-Use-Custom-Video-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="6. Use Custom Video Thumbnails"></a>6. Use Custom Video Thumbnails</h2><p>A <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >custom thumbnail <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an excellent way to make your videos stand out (<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check out these awesome thumbnail makers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). A good thumbnail is its own piece of quality, customized, visual content that has the power to draw in audiences from search engine results. Make sure to take thumbnail-specific photos and perfect those images with text and graphics in Photoshop or a free alternative like Canva.</p><p>Custom thumbnails come with new metadata for your video and they can often be indexed in Google image searches along with the video content that you create. This means that you will have access to a text search via Google (your video title and description), video searches via Google, a video search via YouTube, and an image search via Google too.</p><p>In order to<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a thumbnail that stands out <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and attracts more views, you should first search for your video’s title on YouTube and see what kinds of thumbnails come up. You want your thumbnail to be enough like the results that viewers recognize it as being on the same topic, and different enough that it doesn’t fade into the crowd (a good strategy is to use a splash of color the other creators haven’t included).</p><p>If you are interested in generating more traffic to any YouTube video be sure to follow these 6 steps for how to get your YouTube video seen (and check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4 more here! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148774/18498" target="_top" id="2148774">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148774" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148774/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-capturing-every-move-in-games-with-fbx-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capturing Every Move in Games with FBX for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-professional-insights-top-5-cloud-based-videographer-tools/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Professional Insights Top 5 Cloud-Based Videographer Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/beginners-guide-capturing-youtube-videos-as-screencasts-without-payment/"><u>Beginner's Guide Capturing YouTube Videos as Screencasts Without Payment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/broadview-networks-navigating-mcn-choices-for-2024/"><u>Broadview Networks Navigating MCN Choices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/does-recording-your-viewed-youtube-content-violate-laws-in-2024/"><u>Does Recording Your Viewed YouTube Content Violate Laws, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-whatsapp-messages-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Track WhatsApp Messages on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Without Them Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-duplex-monitoring-transcription/"><u>In 2024, Duplex Monitoring Transcription</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgotten-the-voicemail-password-of-samsung-galaxy-a05-try-these-fixes-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Forgotten The Voicemail Password Of Samsung Galaxy A05?

The outline serves as a guide that will make the finished product better compared to when you just tried to wing it.

Divide the script into four parts: Opening, Primer, Body, and Closing.</p><p>For the Opening part, ask a simple question that can be answered in the Body. Use the Primer section to inform viewers what they should expect from the video. The Body will contain the main content of the video. It should cover all the things that viewers need to know. Lastly, the closing wraps up the video by providing social media details and a teaser for the next video.</p><p>Note:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep It Concise</strong></li></ul><p>In a personal vlog-style video you might ramble and go off on amusing tangents, and that’s something viewers love within that genre.

Are you looking for ways to make your video attractive and interesting? Well, one way to do so is to create a well-structured script. Whether it is a 30-second video or a full-length movie, a script will guide the video creation process. Below are some tips to keep in mind if you want to learn how to write a script for your YouTube video.</p><ol><li><a href="#before">Before Write Your YouTube Script</a></li><li><a href="#writing">Writing a Script for a YouTube Video</a></li><li><a href="#after">After Writing Your YouTube Video Script</a></li><li><a href="#bonus">Bonus Tip- Add Subtitles to Your YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</a></li></ol><h2 id="Before-You-Write-Your-YouTube-Script-3"><a href="#Before-You-Write-Your-YouTube-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="Before You Write Your YouTube Script"></a>Before You Write Your YouTube Script</h2><p>Here are some things to do before you start writing your script for YouTube:</p><h3 id="1-Collect-Ideas-3"><a href="#1-Collect-Ideas-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Collect Ideas"></a>1. Collect Ideas</h3><p>Before you write the script, it’s a good idea to gather ideas. If you think of something, or if something funny happens, write it down right away. Keep a pen and notebook handy that way you will not forget about it.</p><h3 id="2-Find-an-area-that-is-not-distracting-3"><a href="#2-Find-an-area-that-is-not-distracting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Find an area that is not distracting"></a>2. Find an area that is not distracting</h3><p>Once you have gathered enough ideas for the YouTube video, the next step is to find a place where you can write in peace and be inspired. Avoid any distractions to ensure that you will be able to put all your thoughts and ideas onto paper.</p><h2 id="Writing-a-Script-for-a-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#Writing-a-Script-for-a-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Writing a Script for a YouTube Video"></a>Writing a Script for a YouTube Video</h2><p>Now that you’re ready to sit down and write, here’s what you do:</p><h3 id="1-Create-an-outline-for-your-story-3"><a href="#1-Create-an-outline-for-your-story-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Create an outline for your story"></a>1. Create an outline for your story</h3><p>The first step in writing a script is to develop an outline for the story. You might think that it is an unnecessary step, but it’s one of the most important steps to writing a script. The outline serves as a guide that will make the finished product better compared to when you just tried to wing it. One tip on how to write a script for a YouTube video is to have an outline for the beginning, middle, and ending of the video. Once you have all the elements of the story, then you can start with the first draft of the script.</p><h3 id="2-Set-the-tone-3"><a href="#2-Set-the-tone-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Set the tone"></a>2. Set the tone</h3><p>The tone you pick for the video will depend on your audience. It’s safe to assume that viewers want something that’s unique, informative, and engaging. In some cases, they look for a video that’s personal, and they can relate to it. Humor is also something that you should consider when writing a script.</p><h3 id="3-Just-keep-writing-3"><a href="#3-Just-keep-writing-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Just keep writing"></a>3. Just keep writing</h3><p>When you start writing it is important that you keep on doing it no matter what happens. Just write down everything that comes into your mind. After that, read what you’ve written. If you think that something needs to be replaced, then replace it. If you get more inspiration and think that the script is lacking, then add to it.</p><h3 id="4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured-3"><a href="#4-Make-sure-that-the-script-is-well-structured-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Make sure that the script is well structured"></a>4. Make sure that the script is well structured</h3><p>It’s important to learn how to write a script that is well structured. Divide the script into four parts: Opening, Primer, Body, and Closing.</p><p>For the Opening part, ask a simple question that can be answered in the Body. Use the Primer section to inform viewers what they should expect from the video. The Body will contain the main content of the video. It should cover all the things that viewers need to know. Lastly, the closing wraps up the video by providing social media details and a teaser for the next video.</p><p>Note:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep It Concise</strong></li></ul><p>In a personal vlog-style video you might ramble and go off on amusing tangents, and that’s something viewers love within that genre. If you are trying to teach, however, your viewers will benefit more if you keep things concise and direct.</p><p>Tell people up front what point you are trying to make before you jump into making it.</p><ul><li><strong>Be Interactive</strong></li></ul><p>Talk to people, not at them.</p><p>While you are scripting and focusing on the information you want to deliver, it’s easy to forget to be personal.</p><p>Remember to refer to your audience as ‘you’, not ‘you guys’ (you are speaking to individual viewers, not a collective) and to include moments of engagement throughout your videos. Ask your viewers questions to keep their minds active, this also encourages them to leave comments.</p><h2 id="After-Writing-your-YouTube-Video-Script-3"><a href="#After-Writing-your-YouTube-Video-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="After Writing your YouTube Video Script"></a>After Writing your YouTube Video Script</h2><p>After writing the script, the next step is to invite a trusted friend or family member to look at the script. Ask them for their feedback and if they have any ideas to add. And don’t forget, be open-minded to feedback</p><p>These are the tips to keep in mind when considering how to write a script for a YouTube video.</p><h2 id="Add-Subtitles-to-Your-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Add-Subtitles-to-Your-YouTube-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Add Subtitles to Your YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Add Subtitles to Your YouTube Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Creating subtitles with Wondershare Filmora is very easy and a newbie can easily add relevant texts to the video they are trying to edit with Filmora.

Choosing A Potential Partner"></a>1. Choosing A Potential Partner</h2><p>Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.</p><p>A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-potential-collab-partner.jpg"                      alt=" Choosing A Potential Partner"                ></p><p><em>Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?</em></p><p>Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.</p><p>Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.</p><p>There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A" >Mr.Kate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.</p><p><em>Mr.Kate makes over **<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub_confirmation=1" >MyLifeAsEva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**’s bedroom.</em></p><p>Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.</p><p>A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!</p><h2 id="2-How-to-contact-a-partner"><a href="#2-How-to-contact-a-partner" class="headerlink" title="2. How to contact a partner"></a>2. How to contact a partner</h2><p>Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the <strong>About</strong> tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says <strong>for business inquiries</strong>, click on <strong>view email address</strong>, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.</p><p>Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.</p><h2 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Popular Types of Collab Videos"></a>3. Popular Types of Collab Videos</h2><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ"><strong>Gabrielle</strong></a>talks about different types of collabs and how well they work.</em></p><p>In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:</p><h4 id="1-Shout-outs"><a href="#1-Shout-outs" class="headerlink" title="#1. Shout outs"></a>#1. Shout outs</h4><p>In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.</p><p>I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.</p><h4 id="2-Guest-spots"><a href="#2-Guest-spots" class="headerlink" title="2. Guest spots"></a>2. Guest spots</h4><p>This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.</p><p>For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!</p><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg" >Matthias <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> gets <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle" >NateWantsToBattle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals.</em></p><p>Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.</p><p>Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.</p><h4 id="3-Long-distance-collabs"><a href="#3-Long-distance-collabs" class="headerlink" title="3. Long distance collabs"></a>3. Long distance collabs</h4><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg" >Lauren <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in Toronto and <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ" >Aja <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense.</em></p><p>Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.</p><h2 id="4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations"><a href="#4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"></a>4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations</h2><p>Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.</p><p>Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best.

Choosing A Potential Partner</h2><p>Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.</p><p>A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-potential-collab-partner.jpg"                      alt=" Choosing A Potential Partner"                ></p><p><em>Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?</em></p><p>Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.</p><p>Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.</p><p>There are exceptions to this, of course.

They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.</p><p><em>Mr.Kate makes over **<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub_confirmation=1" >MyLifeAsEva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**’s bedroom.</em></p><p>Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them.

How to contact a partner</h2><p>Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the <strong>About</strong> tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says <strong>for business inquiries</strong>, click on <strong>view email address</strong>, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.</p><p>Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.</p><h2 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos-1"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Popular Types of Collab Videos"></a>3. Popular Types of Collab Videos</h2><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ"><strong>Gabrielle</strong></a>talks about different types of collabs and how well they work.</em></p><p>In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:</p><h4 id="1-Shout-outs-1"><a href="#1-Shout-outs-1" class="headerlink" title="#1. Shout outs"></a>#1. Shout outs</h4><p>In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.</p><p>I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.</p><h4 id="2-Guest-spots-1"><a href="#2-Guest-spots-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Guest spots"></a>2. Guest spots</h4><p>This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.</p><p>For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!</p><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg" >Matthias <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> gets <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle" >NateWantsToBattle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals.</em></p><p>Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.</p><p>Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.</p><h4 id="3-Long-distance-collabs-1"><a href="#3-Long-distance-collabs-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Long distance collabs"></a>3. Long distance collabs</h4><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg" >Lauren <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in Toronto and <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ" >Aja <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense.</em></p><p>Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.</p><h2 id="4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations-1"><a href="#4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"></a>4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations</h2><p>Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.</p><p>Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best. It will help you seem more like a person who is being introduced than a guest star in a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/getting-most-out-of-collaborations.jpg"                      alt=" Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"                ></p><p><em>Kitty got the collab!

Popular Types of Collab Videos</h2><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ"><strong>Gabrielle</strong></a>talks about different types of collabs and how well they work.</em></p><p>In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:</p><h4 id="1-Shout-outs-2"><a href="#1-Shout-outs-2" class="headerlink" title="#1. Shout outs"></a>#1. Shout outs</h4><p>In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.</p><p>I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.</p><h4 id="2-Guest-spots-2"><a href="#2-Guest-spots-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Guest spots"></a>2. Guest spots</h4><p>This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.</p><p>For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!</p><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg" >Matthias <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> gets <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle" >NateWantsToBattle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals.</em></p><p>Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.</p><p>Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.</p><h4 id="3-Long-distance-collabs-2"><a href="#3-Long-distance-collabs-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way.

Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations</h2><p>Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel.

Choosing A Potential Partner"></a>1. Choosing A Potential Partner</h2><p>Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.</p><p>A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-potential-collab-partner.jpg"                      alt=" Choosing A Potential Partner"                ></p><p><em>Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?</em></p><p>Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.</p><p>Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.</p><p>There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A" >Mr.Kate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.</p><p><em>Mr.Kate makes over **<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub_confirmation=1" >MyLifeAsEva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**’s bedroom.</em></p><p>Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.</p><p>A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!</p><h2 id="2-How-to-contact-a-partner-3"><a href="#2-How-to-contact-a-partner-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How to contact a partner"></a>2. How to contact a partner</h2><p>Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the <strong>About</strong> tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says <strong>for business inquiries</strong>, click on <strong>view email address</strong>, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.</p><p>Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.</p><h2 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos-3"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

It may make you angry, hurt your feelings, or just leave you baffled over how someone could come away from your video with out-of-the-blue opinion the hater has posted. ‘Do not feed the trolls’ is a mantra that can be hard to abide by. This article will explain why you should not engage trolls and how to talk to them if you find yourself doing it anyways.</p><h2 id="How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Deal-with-Negative-Comments-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube"></a>How to Deal with Negative Comments on YouTube</h2><h4 id="1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll"><a href="#1-Identifying-Trolls-When-Is-A-Troll-Not-a-Troll" class="headerlink" title="1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?"></a>1. Identifying Trolls &#x2F; When Is A Troll Not a Troll?</h4><p> The internet is full of trolls and if you continue making YouTube videos – especially videos that get a lot of views – then you are sure to be attacked by a few. Or, alternatively, a troll may attack your other viewers in the comments of your videos. It is extremely easy to be a troll and so there are a lot of them.</p><p> Most trolls are easy to spot. They leave comments designed to hurt you or make you angry, often using over-the-top offensive language. Not all trolls are so obvious, though. Some trolls will be nice at first – flatteringly nice, even – and it will take a few comments before they turn on you or your subscribers. They want you to like them so you put more stock in what they are saying later and take longer to start ignoring them. Some trolls will even go back to being nice to reel you back in.</p><p> It is important to remember that not everybody who leaves negative comments on YouTube videos is a troll. Step back from your emotional reaction to a comment and make sure there is really nothing constructive in it before you dismiss it. Some people have nasty ways of expressing legitimate opinions, and sometimes even when there is no decipherable meaning behind a rude comment the person is not trying to troll you. Some people just have poor communication skills. For example, if someone leaves a comment on your video that consists of only the word ‘bad’ you cannot know for sure what they meant. It could be that they are agreeing with something you mentioned disliking in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls"><a href="#2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls" class="headerlink" title="2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls"></a>2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls</h4><p> Trolls are bored and looking for attention. When you respond, they win. You may think you are demonstrating to them that they were out of line, or logically proving them wrong, but the troll does not care. Your outraged responses are what trolls want and will only entertain them.</p><p> Also, trolls do not care if they are wrong. They almost always seem to think that their opinions are the only ones that count for anything, but quite often their opinions are not even their real opinions. Chances are they do not actually believe anything they are saying to you they just know what to say to make you mad. Remember that you will always be more invested in any interaction you have with a troll than they are. For them it is a game and they cannot lose because they do not really care. If you take the bait it’s fun, and if you do not then they will move on to a target that will. Even if you put hours of effort into chasing off a troll and manage to make them go away they will have enjoyed the whole thing and you will be left exhausted.</p><h4 id="3-But-If-You-Do…"><a href="#3-But-If-You-Do…" class="headerlink" title="3. But If You Do…"></a>3. But If You Do…</h4><p> While you should avoid talking to trolls, sometimes you cannot. Trolls occasionally start off making kind comments or asking legitimate questions to lure you in. You might be a couple comments into a conversation before a troll reveals their true colors.</p><p> There are also times when you respond even though you know you should not because you just cannot let a specific rude comment go unanswered. It is easy to say you should never feed the trolls, but a lot of people cannot help it. If you find yourself engaging a troll there are a few things you can do to try and manage the situation.</p><p> First, avoid using any emotional language; they love that. Keep your responses either pleasantly detached or dry and factual. Say what you feel you need to say and ask the troll for more information. If the troll has made a false claim then ask them for evidence as if you are genuinely interested in learning more. It is highly unlikely they will be able to provide any, although they may make something up. If the troll has made a blanket statement about how terrible they think you are then pretend you either value their input or find them funny and ask them to explain. They will either leave or respond with more insults.</p><p> You will not get the troll to say they were wrong or apologize so that should never be your goal. What you can do is create a public record of the troll being corrected for others to judge for themselves. If you maintain a calm, unaffected, tone then the troll will find you boring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> If you have put a lot of work into your YouTube videos then it only makes sense that you have an emotional investment in them.

Some trolls will be nice at first – flatteringly nice, even – and it will take a few comments before they turn on you or your subscribers. They want you to like them so you put more stock in what they are saying later and take longer to start ignoring them. Some trolls will even go back to being nice to reel you back in.</p><p> It is important to remember that not everybody who leaves negative comments on YouTube videos is a troll. Step back from your emotional reaction to a comment and make sure there is really nothing constructive in it before you dismiss it. Some people have nasty ways of expressing legitimate opinions, and sometimes even when there is no decipherable meaning behind a rude comment the person is not trying to troll you. Some people just have poor communication skills. For example, if someone leaves a comment on your video that consists of only the word ‘bad’ you cannot know for sure what they meant. It could be that they are agreeing with something you mentioned disliking in the video.</p><h4 id="2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls-3"><a href="#2-Why-You-Shouldn’t-Talk-To-Trolls-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls"></a>2. Why You Shouldn’t Talk To Trolls</h4><p> Trolls are bored and looking for attention. When you respond, they win. You may think you are demonstrating to them that they were out of line, or logically proving them wrong, but the troll does not care. Your outraged responses are what trolls want and will only entertain them.</p><p> Also, trolls do not care if they are wrong. They almost always seem to think that their opinions are the only ones that count for anything, but quite often their opinions are not even their real opinions. Chances are they do not actually believe anything they are saying to you they just know what to say to make you mad. Remember that you will always be more invested in any interaction you have with a troll than they are. For them it is a game and they cannot lose because they do not really care. If you take the bait it’s fun, and if you do not then they will move on to a target that will. Even if you put hours of effort into chasing off a troll and manage to make them go away they will have enjoyed the whole thing and you will be left exhausted.</p><h4 id="3-But-If-You-Do…-3"><a href="#3-But-If-You-Do…-3" class="headerlink" title="3. But If You Do…"></a>3. But If You Do…</h4><p> While you should avoid talking to trolls, sometimes you cannot. Trolls occasionally start off making kind comments or asking legitimate questions to lure you in. You might be a couple comments into a conversation before a troll reveals their true colors.</p><p> There are also times when you respond even though you know you should not because you just cannot let a specific rude comment go unanswered. It is easy to say you should never feed the trolls, but a lot of people cannot help it. If you find yourself engaging a troll there are a few things you can do to try and manage the situation.</p><p> First, avoid using any emotional language; they love that. Keep your responses either pleasantly detached or dry and factual. Say what you feel you need to say and ask the troll for more information. If the troll has made a false claim then ask them for evidence as if you are genuinely interested in learning more. It is highly unlikely they will be able to provide any, although they may make something up. If the troll has made a blanket statement about how terrible they think you are then pretend you either value their input or find them funny and ask them to explain. They will either leave or respond with more insults.</p><p> You will not get the troll to say they were wrong or apologize so that should never be your goal. What you can do is create a public record of the troll being corrected for others to judge for themselves. If you maintain a calm, unaffected, tone then the troll will find you boring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Twinkling-Typefaces-The-Essence-of-Bouncy-Text"><a href="#Twinkling-Typefaces-The-Essence-of-Bouncy-Text" class="headerlink" title="Twinkling Typefaces: The Essence of Bouncy Text"></a>Twinkling Typefaces: The Essence of Bouncy Text</h2><h1 id="How-to-Create-Animated-Bouncing-Text"><a href="#How-to-Create-Animated-Bouncing-Text" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Animated Bouncing Text"></a>How to Create Animated Bouncing Text</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Liza-Brown"><a href="#Liza-Brown" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Earlier, you learned how to have a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >bounce text effect in Adobe After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.

The benefit of using any such web app is that all the processing is done on site’s server, and it is only a web browser and an Internet connection that you need to have at your side.</p><p>Some most trusted websites to generate <strong>bounce text</strong> are listed below:</p><h4 id="1-ENGFTO-3"><a href="#1-ENGFTO-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

While the former gives you more flexibility when it comes to customizations, the latter doesn’t require any app to be installed on your PC. In addition, many times the web apps offer their services for free, and therefore they are preferred by the novice users who are not much into post-production processes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-elevate-content-discovery-the-tubebuddy-way/"><u>[New] Elevate Content Discovery The TubeBuddy Way</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-aesthetic-ambitions-launching-a-youtube-channel-for-makeup-maven/"><u>[Updated] Aesthetic Ambitions Launching a YouTube Channel for Makeup Maven</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-video-previews-easily-accessible-for-all/"><u>[Updated] Video Previews Easily Accessible for All</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-charting-the-financial-pathway-of-tseries-within-youtube-market-space/"><u>2024 Approved Charting the Financial Pathway of TSeries Within YouTube Market Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/approved-top-grossing-youtube-titans/"><u>2024 Approved Top-Grossing YouTube Titans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/choosing-between-podcast-and-youtube-for-content-delivery/"><u>Choosing Between Podcast and YouTube for Content Delivery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-you-transfer-files-from-oppo-f25-pro-5g-to-iphone-151413-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How Can You Transfer Files From Oppo F25 Pro 5G To iPhone 15/14/13? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-google-pixel-7a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Fake Snapchat Location without Jailbreak On Google Pixel 7a | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-distribute-your-youtube-collection/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide Distribute Your YouTube Collection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/thinking-about-changing-your-netflix-region-without-a-vpn-on-realme-narzo-60-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Thinking About Changing Your Netflix Region Without a VPN On Realme Narzo 60 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/d-dvd-dvd/"><u>ご利用いただける D DVD コピーガードを解除:市販・レンタルDVD全品でおすすめの最新ツール大公開</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Dailymotion became one of the most popular video platforms in France and then Europe in just 1 year. You can upload and share videos on Dailymotion like on YouTube. There is a slight difference in their focus. Dailymotion’s content tends to be professional, while YouTube’s is user-made.</p><p>Dailymotion has over 300 million users every month.

Let’s have a look at what the new eligibility criteria look like:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/unlock-youtube-monetization-with-500-subscribers-1.JPG"                      alt="new eligibility criteria"                ></p><p>The eligibility criteria for the YPP program are now easier and more achievable than before. To apply, you now need:</p><ul><li>At least 500 subscribers</li><li>Three Shorts or Video uploads in the last 90 days</li><li>At least 3,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or</li><li>At least 3 million public Short videos in the last 90 days</li></ul><p>The new requirements are lower than the old ones.

It is your chance to make a quick pitch to them about why they should subscribe. You can use your channel trailer to let new visitors to your channel know what kind of videos you make and to convince them to subscribe. Here are 5 tips to make an effective YouTube channel trailer.</p><h2 id="Part-1-5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Channel-Trailer"><a href="#Part-1-5-Tips-for-Making-a-Great-Channel-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 5 Tips for Making a Great Channel Trailer"></a>Part 1: 5 Tips for Making a Great Channel Trailer</h2><p>Here are our top 5 recommendations for anybody creating a YouTube channel trailer:</p><h4 id="Reach-Out-–-It’s-All-About-Your-Viewers"><a href="#Reach-Out-–-It’s-All-About-Your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="Reach Out – It’s All About Your Viewers"></a>Reach Out – It’s All About Your Viewers</h4><p>Use your channel trailer to try to connect to the individual viewer watching it. Greet that one person as one person, as a ‘you’, instead of as a member of a group (i.e., avoid saying ‘you guys’).</p><p>The more you can make your trailer about the person watching it, the better. You are telling them about yourself, but you are doing it for their benefit. Address them directly (i.e. ‘If you like…’ or ‘you don’t want to miss’.) and make everything you say about them. For example, instead of saying ‘I post tutorials about’, try ‘you can learn about’.</p><h4 id="Flaunt-Your-Personality-–-It’s-All-About-You"><a href="#Flaunt-Your-Personality-–-It’s-All-About-You" class="headerlink" title="Flaunt Your Personality – It’s All About You"></a>Flaunt Your Personality – It’s All About You</h4><p>One of the golden rules of YouTube is ‘be yourself’. People will subscribe because they enjoy your personality and want to see more of it.</p><p>Use your trailer as an opportunity to showcase your unique perspective. Be yourself, and be the person that is excited to be making great YouTube videos. You are at your best when you let people see how much you care about something, so show your viewers how much you care about delivering great video content. This is what will make people want to subscribe.</p><h4 id="Talk-about-All-the-Cool-Stuff-You-Do"><a href="#Talk-about-All-the-Cool-Stuff-You-Do" class="headerlink" title="Talk about All the Cool Stuff You Do"></a>Talk about All the Cool Stuff You Do</h4><p>The best channel trailers give viewers a window into your channel. You need to show people what to expect from you as a personality, but you also need to tell them what to expect in terms of your videos.</p><p>Your channel trailer should include information like: what kinds of videos you make, why you make them, and what your upload schedule is.</p><p>Be specific. Instead of saying you make videos about makeup, say you make look tutorials and talk about your favorite styles. Instead of saying you are a gamer, tell your potential subscribers what games you post about and what some of your favorites are.</p><p>A specific schedule is important for getting people to subscribe. Generally, viewers do not subscribe to channels that have not posted in a long time. They subscribe because they do not want to miss out on new content, and if you follow a schedule, they will trust that that new content is on its way.</p><h4 id="Ask-Them-to-Subscribe"><a href="#Ask-Them-to-Subscribe" class="headerlink" title="Ask Them to Subscribe"></a>Ask Them to Subscribe</h4><p>Do not forget to ask the person to view your trailer to subscribe.</p><p>A lot of people go into YouTube thinking people will subscribe if they like their videos, and so making great videos is the only way to get people to subscribe. This is not true.</p><p>Making great videos is the first step to getting subscribers, but the second step is to ask for them. Not everyone subscribes to every channel they visit and enjoy. A person who enjoys your videos is more likely to subscribe if you prompt them to.</p><h4 id="30-Seconds"><a href="#30-Seconds" class="headerlink" title="30 Seconds"></a>30 Seconds</h4><p>The ideal length for a YouTube channel trailer is 30 seconds, or between 30 seconds and 1 minute.</p><p>The people viewing your trailer did not come to YouTube for the purpose of watching it. They are unlikely to give it much time before they continue browsing. This means you need to grab their attention tightly right away, but it also means you need to keep your trailer bite-sized.</p><p>Thirty seconds should be long enough to tell people what your channel is about, show off your personality, and ask them to subscribe. If you take much longer, viewers will click away before they hear your full pitch.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Channel-Trailer-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Channel-Trailer-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Channel Trailer Using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Channel Trailer Using Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Here are a few simple steps to setting up your channel trailer.</p><ol><li>Turn on channel customization.

There are also a lot of ways in which it is different. You always have to watch out for camera shake, for example, but it can be even harder to control when you’re walking around shooting on your mobile device. Here are three things to keep in mind when vlogging with your smartphone.</p><h4 id="Part-1-Keep-It-Steady"><a href="#Part-1-Keep-It-Steady" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Keep It Steady"></a>Part 1. Keep It Steady</h4><p> For a nice, smooth, shot consider resting your hand up on a railing, table, or anything else that will keep it steady while you film. Camera shake is always distracting to viewers, and smartphone videos are notoriously unstable because you are almost always holding your phone in your hand.</p><p> There is equipment you can use to cut out camera shake. You can get a smartphone mount for your tripod, or you can even stabilize your phone using a selfie stick. Many of the very newest smartphones have built in hardware called ‘OIS’ – optical image stabilization – that helps reduce shakiness.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Be-Heard"><a href="#Part-2-Be-Heard" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Be Heard"></a>Part 2. Be Heard</h4><p> You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you say it! Smartphones do not tend to have very good microphones built in (neither do most cameras), so try to vlog from somewhere without a lot of background noise. It will help a lot if your voice has nothing to compete with.</p><p> Ideally, you should get an external mic to record your voice while you vlog on your phone. There are shotgun mics you can plug directly into the audio jack on your phone which will record great audio, or you can get a high quality MP3 recorder and carry it around in your pocket.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

If you record a video with your phone held so that it is tall – a ‘portrait’ shot – then your video will have thick black bars on either side when you post it to YouTube. If you tilt your phone so that it is wide you will record a ‘landscape’ shot, which will match the dimensions YouTube plays videos in.</p><p> The exception to this is videos you plan to post on Instagram. On Instagram everything is cropped into a square, and it is easier to imagine what your footage will look like as a square when you hold your phone strait up. Simply focus on the top of your screen and treat a portion of the bottom of your screen as if it is not there. When you hold your phone horizontally you need to try and estimate how much of the middle of your screen will make it in to your Instagram video, which can be awkward.</p><p> Those are the three main things to keep in mind, but if you are planning on posting directly to YouTube from your phone then you should also make sure you have a mobile app you can use to edit it first.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a full-feature video editing app available for both Android and iPhone operating systems.

When you hold your phone horizontally you need to try and estimate how much of the middle of your screen will make it in to your Instagram video, which can be awkward.</p><p> Those are the three main things to keep in mind, but if you are planning on posting directly to YouTube from your phone then you should also make sure you have a mobile app you can use to edit it first.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a full-feature video editing app available for both Android and iPhone operating systems.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Alienware as a company has changed a lot since its early days back in Miami as a boutique PC builder. Acquired in 2006 by tech giant Dell, the brand has had some ups and downs over the years since then, but they still remain a reliable option for those seeking quality<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/building-vs-buying-a-pc-832692" >prebuilt computers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> One such model Alienware has continued to build and improve upon over the years is their Aurora Desktop Gaming PC. Originally released in 2009 with the R1, the Aurora has seen<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/alienware-aurora-r7-review-4689097" >several iterations <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the last decade, steadily improving internals and changing designs. The R9 is Alienware’s latest version to hit the market—each model equipped with some of the newest tech around.</p><p> If the idea of building a computer from scratch with lots of individual components, yards of wires and nerve-racking installations seems a bit too much for you, picking up a PC like this that’s ready to go right out of the box can help new users get into the world of PC gaming without the hassle (though it really isn’t too bad these days).</p><p> So how does the Aurora R9 measure up against competitors in the massive prebuilt PC space? Peruse our review here and find out for yourself before pulling the trigger on such a costly purchase.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wRBNGBQw39Gc3PVZ6i0PJB4LuWE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-08-406d659ae21641d2b9df53303e8f6d76.jpg"                      alt="Dell Alienware Aurora R9"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Design-Polarizing-sci-fi-aesthetics"><a href="#Design-Polarizing-sci-fi-aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="Design: Polarizing sci-fi aesthetics"></a><strong>Design: Polarizing sci-fi aesthetics</strong></h2><p> The best way to describe Alienware’s design for a vast majority of their products can be summed up as “polarizing.” Going all the way back to the company’s early days, their sci-fi and alien-esque aesthetics have always appealed to some, while those who prefer clean lines and minimal looks flee in the opposite direction.</p><p> The progression of the Aurora’s tower design has drastically changed between models, but the R9 continues this potentially polarizing design with its overall look. What we essentially mean here is that when it comes to the Aurora, you’ll either love or hate it.</p><p> Shaped a bit like a futuristic oblong jet engine, the R9 features a huge air intake along the front that tapers from back to front. It comes in two colors currently, including grey and white. Despite being marketed as more of a mid-tower case, the R9 is quite bulky and large thanks to this design choice. Weighing in at nearly 40 pounds (which will fluctuate depending on which hardware you select), it’s also heavy, so don’t plan on moving it around too often.</p><p> Along this front intake is a slim flat panel surrounded by the R9’s only RGB lighting (more expensive models also include an RGB “Alienware” on the right side), which changes fluidly between various tones when powered up (a nice touch for those who don’t love RGB plastered everywhere, but not enough for those who love RGB everything).</p><p> Right at the top of the panel is the iconic Alienware logo (also RGB) that cleverly doubles as the desktop’s power button. Below this is an array of handy ports, including three Type-A USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, a single<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 3.1 Gen 1 port, a headphone&#x2F;line out and microphone&#x2F;line in. The placement of these is superb, allowing users to easily reach more than enough ports for just about anything they need to connect to their tower.</p><p> Moving along to the top and sides of the case, the R9 surprisingly doesn’t adopt the popular new trend of including a glass or plastic window pane so users can see their PC’s internals, but not everyone is on board for this look either. Instead, the top and sides are simply equipped with some intakes for airflow, while the right side has a large Alienware label near the back.</p><p> The rear of the new Aurora model isn’t the most attractive, with its bare metal construction, but this isn’t really important since you’ll likely never see it. Without listing the huge amount of ports back here (you can check the specs tab on this page for the full breakdown), the back hosts all of your connections for displays, power, speakers, USBs and more. Arranged in a vertical I&#x2F;O shield, these are all easily accessible and quite standard for a desktop PC.</p><p> If you love Alienware or the look of the R9, it’s not a bad option, but it’s certainly not the most frugal.</p><p> Inside the case, Alienware has made the new R9 quite upgradeable, allowing owners to easily pull things apart for access to various components. Though it’s a bit cramped inside, the genius ability to swing the PSU (power supply unit) out to the side when the case is removed provides easier access to the motherboard and all its parts. While we’re a bit concerned with the airflow due to this tight fit inside the case, it does allow you to upgrade hardware down the line if you want.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Plug-and-play"><a href="#Setup-Process-Plug-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Plug and play"></a><strong>Setup Process: Plug and play</strong></h2><p> Because this is a prebuilt, setting up your new PC is super simple—essentially plug and play. This is another hugely important thing to consider if you want to get into PC gaming, but don’t know the first thing about installing an OS, troubleshooting build issues or navigating the BIOS.</p><p> Once you’ve got the R9 unboxed, the first step is to plug everything in. The basic list for this includes the power cable, your display port of choice (the R9 comes with VGA,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/displayport-vs-hdmi-4686971" >DisplayPort <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> depending on your hardware), a mouse and keyboard and Ethernet if you’re not using the included Wi-Fi card.</p><p> With your tower properly plugged in to all these various parts, you can then go ahead and hit the power button to boot it up. Because these PCs come pre-equipped with Windows 10, the Aurora should only take a bit to get started during the initial boot sequence before prompting you to follow along with the on-screen instructions for setting up Windows. This portion is pretty simple, so just follow along the steps that’ll have you sign into your Microsoft account (or create one), connect to the internet, select a language and timezone, etc.</p><p> Upon landing at your new desktop within Windows 10, the rest of the setup process is mostly up to you. Typically, I continue the initial process by checking for Windows updates, installing those first and restarting as necessary, followed by downloading updates for drivers and graphics cards. Once you’ve got the important software updated, the next best thing is to download your favorite apps and software you want to use, like Steam, Spotify, Chrome, etc.</p><p> From here, you can either fine tune your new PC’s looks within the settings menu or keep things as they are. If you’re using a monitor with a higher refresh rate or resolution, it’s also a good idea to ensure your PC is fully utilizing this by perusing the display settings and options. After all, nobody likes finding out they’ve been stuck on 60Hz with their display that’s capable of hitting 144Hz.</p><h2 id="Performance-Results-may-vary"><a href="#Performance-Results-may-vary" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Results may vary"></a><strong>Performance: Results may vary</strong></h2><p> Determining the overall performance of the Aurora R9 will entirely be subject to which hardware options or model you purchased. For performance, you get what you pay for. A quick note on this is that you should typically purchase the best components for your specific needs that are within your budget. If you want to primarily game, your GPU is perhaps the most important part, so start there. For those who want a balance between gaming and work performance, make sure you get a decent CPU.</p><p> So with that disclaimer out of the way, we can evaluate the performance of our specific R9 model, which happens to be the base unit at the cheapest price point. This variant is equipped with a 9th Gen Intel Core i5 9400, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB HyperX FURY DDR4 XMP at 2666MHz and a 1TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb&#x2F;s HDD. None of these components are considered top-of-the-line, but this is the budget build of the R9 models that’ll probably be one of the more popular options due to the price.</p><p> First up, let’s take a look at boot time. Unfortunately, this model doesn’t include an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/solid-state-drive-833448" >SSD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for the boot drive, unlike most of the pricier options. You can add one, but it costs extra. HDDs like the 7200RPM one on our version are notoriously slower compared to an SSD, so the roughly 40-second boot time for ours leaves a bit to be desired. In contrast, an SSD will normally take just 10 seconds.</p><p> This HDD is also slower for everything else. Searching through folders, opening files, loading games and anything else that involves storage access will be a bit sluggish. I may be biased coming from a PC with M.2 SSDs, but it’s something to consider when looking through options on hardware when buying a PC. If you can afford it, I highly recommend adding an SSD, even if it’s just for the OS.</p><p> The i5 9400 CPU certainly won’t blow you away, but for most lighter tasks like browsing the web, shuffling through files and doing some light editing with Adobe products, it’s perfectly capable for most average users. If you want to do lots of heavy computing, you’ll need to spend the dough on a beefier CPU.</p><p> On the whole, this hardware config is decent for light users, but probably not enough for those who want to do a lot of multitasking or intense, CPU-dependent processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/zWvKnnWGsRBdtRIHTYYD7HEs0qI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-13-88a6bd8dac13438794a0bb038df7757f.jpg"                      alt="Dell Alienware Aurora R9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139121/17108" target="_top" id="2139121">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139121" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139121/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Gaming-From-ok-to-amazing-if-you-have-the-cash"><a href="#Gaming-From-ok-to-amazing-if-you-have-the-cash" class="headerlink" title="Gaming: From ok to amazing, if you have the cash"></a><strong>Gaming: From ok to amazing, if you have the cash</strong></h2><p> Much like performance in everyday tasks, your performance in gaming is based on what hardware your Aurora features. You can go all the way up to a monsterous gaming rig with a GTX 2080, or all the way down to our little base model with a GTX 1650, so it’s up to you how much performance you’re willing to pay for.</p><p> For our R9 with a modest 1650 GPU, performance will surpass entry-level gaming consoles of the time, like a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , PS4 or Xbox One. However, it’s essentially capped with 1080p gaming, so keep that in mind if you want to bump up to 2K or 4K resolutions, as it’ll struggle to provide solid performance.</p><p> We tested the Aurora with a number of titles, from indie games to bigger AAA titles, each of which can vastly differ in terms of optimization. For our monitor, we used a 1080p Viewsonic display capable of hitting 144Hz to ensure this peripheral wouldn’t hold back the PC.</p><p> Now onto the tests. First up, we monitored the average frames per second (fps) on some bigger titles like Gears 5, Battlefield V and PUBGrunning the recommended settings. For hardware intensive games like these, the R9 was surprisingly capable, usually in the range of 60-70fps on average. This isn’t amazing, but it is solid and better than the performance of something like an XB1. Thanks to our monitor’s adaptive synchronization technology, we didn’t notice any big tears or stutters either.</p><p> With indie games or those less GPU-intensive, like Terraria, League of Legends and World of Warcraft, this specific R9 variant was more than capable, successfully getting over 100 FPS with ease and even maxing out the 144Hz of our monitor for some titles. If you’re not someone who demands the best graphics settings or the latest AAA titles, this Aurora is a decent option if you want to save some money.</p><p> Aside from FPS, the load times for games compared to my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-external-hard-drives-4050413" >SSD-equipped <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> PC were much, much slower. Loading into planets and zones in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842" >Destiny 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> takes only a few moments with an SSD, while this HDD R9 felt twice as long or more—similar to what you’d see with any current-gen gaming console (they all have HDDs).</p><p> Your gaming performance in relation to the Aurora is subject to your hardware, peripherals and network speeds if playing an online game, so choose the best model you can afford within your budgetary restrictions and keep in mind how you plan to use your PC.</p><h2 id="Audio-Decent-prebuilt-performance-and-surround-sound"><a href="#Audio-Decent-prebuilt-performance-and-surround-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Decent prebuilt performance and surround sound"></a><strong>Audio: Decent prebuilt performance and surround sound</strong></h2><p> A quality audio setup is something often overlooked when it comes to computers, but it’s something that can really add to the overall enjoyment of your PC. Immersive soundscapes in games and movies, astounding dynamic range in music and crisp, clear dialogue combine to separate the mediocre computers from the great.</p><p> For the Aurora R9, the audio quality is surprisingly good, thanks to a host of included hardware and software options like internal high-definition 7.1+2 performance audio. However, this being a prebuilt coming straight from Dell, it’s a bit more difficult to determine where the included Realtek ALC3861 driver falls on the spectrum because it’s exclusive to Dell products.</p><p> Taking a close look at our entry-level R9 stacked against a similarly priced G5, it’s easy to see how the premium Alienware branding comes into play.</p><p> If you’ve got a beefy external audio setup with lots of speakers, you’re in luck, as the R9 features tons of ports for your equipment. Ports on the back include a center&#x2F;subwoofer output, rear surround output, side surround output and two coaxial S&#x2F;PDIF ports for connecting an amplifier, speakers or a TV for digital audio output through a coaxial cable.</p><p> Although true audiophiles will still want to stick with a DAC, or digital-to-analog converter, the Aurora R9 packs in pretty decent audio options for most users.</p><h2 id="Network-Solid-Ethernet-average-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Network-Solid-Ethernet-average-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Network: Solid Ethernet, average Wi-Fi"></a><strong>Network: Solid Ethernet, average Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p> In the age of the internet, network speeds and performance are paramount for most users, especially so if you’re a gamer. This fact not only applies to those who love online multiplayer games, but also those who prefer singleplayer since most people now download their software online.</p><p> Like most modern computers these days, the Aurora R9 will provide optimal network speeds while connected to a good ole Ethernet cable. Installed on our R9, and all other Aurora models, is the RJ-45 Killer E2500 Gigabit Ethernet port. With a proper Ethernet cable, this port can provide a maximum data rate up to 1,000 Mbps. Since most people around the world still lack access to any internet speeds that quick, the included<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-gigabit-ethernet-816338" >gigabit port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will essentially be capped at whatever your internet speed is (ours is 200 Mbps).</p><p> The R9 also features an integrated networking solution called Killer E2500 Ethernet LAN, which is found on the motherboard of all Alienware Auroras. The Killer E2500 is the newest Rivet Networks gigabit Ethernet controller that works by detecting and prioritizing your games, video and chat applications to improve latency, reduce jitter and help eliminate video freezes.</p><p> Using the included Killer Control Center software provides even more benefits to your network performance. This program allows users to control tons of various aspects for their PC’s network, so it’s a nice extra to have included in the purchase. With this software, you can see which applications are using bandwidth and how much of your bandwidth is being used. Killer Control Center will then automatically prioritize certain apps or let you decide for yourself which ones you want to have priority for optimal performance.</p><p> Wi-Fi is something that still lags far behind a hard-wired connection, and the Aurora R9 is no different in this area. Downloading games in Steam was significantly slower compared to Ethernet, but it’s suitable for browsing the web, streaming content or playing online (though subpar vs. Ethernet).</p><p> There are multiple Wi-Fi options for hardware on the R9 if you’re willing to pay extra, but the included 802.11ac 2x2 Wireless, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 worked well enough for us in a pinch. Even still, you’re better off using a cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wMnVqt6RV24C1Vfncnf2J3E0fAg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/1LW4045927-15-fe70fca5ffd04da6abd8c0ef8f026eef-f6d5eaf9efcb461a902fc750a192dd0c.jpg"                      alt="Dell Alienware Aurora R9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Zach Sweat</p><h2 id="Software-Windows-10-with-some-bloatware-and-extras"><a href="#Software-Windows-10-with-some-bloatware-and-extras" class="headerlink" title="Software: Windows 10 with some bloatware and extras"></a><strong>Software: Windows 10 with some bloatware and extras</strong></h2><p> Whether or not you love Windows 10, the somewhat infamous OS is what you’ll inevitably get from Dell when you purchase an Aurora R9. If you’re new to the system, it takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s simple enough for everyone to navigate once you get going.</p><p> Despite literally no one asking for it, there’s a considerable amount of bloatware included with Windows 10. Most of this software is simply annoying or unnecessary, but some of it can actually be useful.</p><p> The interesting bits of included software come straight from Alienware in the form of their Alienware Command Center. In a nutshell, this command center lets Aurora owners do things such as selecting auto-tuned game profiles, browse overclocking options and control RGB lights with the all-new AlienFX settings.</p><p> With thermal control, you can monitor internal temperatures and adjust fans to their ideal ranges to help remove excess heat from the system while keeping fan volume down. If you’re someone who’s into overclocking, the Alienware Command Center also has an intuitive overclocking control module for squeezing extra performance from your system. Users can create their own profiles here and activate them on the fly.</p><p> For RGB fans, the AlienFX hardware and software provides tons of potential combinations with up to 16.8 million color options. Users can take full control of the external RGB along the front and sides of the tower in addition to supported peripherals. Themes you create can also be saved and assigned to specific games, which is a pretty sweet perk.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934288/19272" target="_top" id="1934288">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934288" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934288/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Not-the-best-bang-for-your-buck"><a href="#Price-Not-the-best-bang-for-your-buck" class="headerlink" title="Price: Not the best bang for your buck"></a><strong>Price: Not the best bang for your buck</strong></h2><p> PC gaming is notoriously expensive to initially get into, but the prices of many components have continued to dwindle over the decades. Although the old adage that building your own computer from scratch is cheaper still holds true, prebuilt computers have also become much more comparable. So how does this Alienware match up?</p><p> First off, boutique builders like Alienware almost always come with a premium, so it’s no surprise that the new Aurora R9 may not be the best bang for your buck if you want to get the most for your money. Alienware is also one of the most famous brands in this sector, so this fact is especially true.</p><p> Starting at $850 for our entry level model and reaching all the way up to $5,000 and beyond for the most monstrous R9 models, the new Aurora isn’t exactly affordable, but it’s not terrible. Using PCPartPicker, we were able to build a comparable PC for roughly $700. This however does require you to assemble it yourself, but it’s not as hard as you might think.</p><p> Shaped a bit like a futuristic oblong jet engine, the R9 features a huge air intake along the front that tapers from back to front.</p><p> Another thing to keep in mind here is that the $850 price point doesn’t include much in the way of peripherals, and these can really add up. The Aurora R9 does include a shoddy Dell keyboard and mouse, but these accessories are definitely the bare minimum, and won’t provide the best experience.</p><p> Overall, the price of the R9 is ok at best, and you do get some nice software features from Alienware, but it’s still cheaper to build your own.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141676/17091" target="_top" id="2141676">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141676" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141676/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Alienware-Aurora-R9-vs-Dell-G5-5090"><a href="#Alienware-Aurora-R9-vs-Dell-G5-5090" class="headerlink" title="Alienware Aurora R9 vs. Dell G5 5090"></a><strong>Alienware Aurora R9 vs. Dell G5 5090</strong></h2><p> Comparing two gaming PCs in a head-to-head competition is difficult due to the sheer amount of potential hardware configurations, but Dell also offers prebuilts outside the Alienware brand that are similar.</p><p> Launched around the same time in 2019, the Aurora R9 and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-g5-5090-review-4843348" >Dell’s G5 5090 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (see at<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/gaming-and-games/new-dell-g5-gaming-desktop/spd/g-series-5090-desktop" >Dell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) provide two potential options if you’re looking for a prebuilt gaming rig. Taking a close look at our entry-level R9 stacked against a similarly priced G5, it’s easy to see how the premium Alienware branding comes into play.</p><p> For $850, you can get our R9 with the 9th Gen Intel Core i5 9400, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650, 8GB HyperX FURY DDR4 XMP at 2666MHz and a 1TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb&#x2F;s HDD. But for $100 less at $750, you can move up to the second-tier G5 equipped with a 9th Gen Intel Core i5 9400, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 8GB DDR4 at 2666MHz, 1TB 7200 RPM SATA 6Gb&#x2F;s HDD.</p><p> As you can see, the Alienware branding adds an additional $100 to the price, and even has a worse GPU. Though the 1660 Ti isn’t a huge step up, it’ll definitely add better performance across the board to your gaming experience. The argument could be made that the Aurora looks much better than the G5 (it’s not a real looker), but if you want the best setup you can get, the G5 offers more for less.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A quality prebuilt, but not the most frugal.</strong></p><p> With a distinct design that only Alienware can pull off, the Aurora R9 is a futuristic-looking prebuilt PC with a lot of good, but a bit of extra cost. If you love Alienware or the look of the R9, it’s not a bad option, but it’s certainly not the most frugal.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Aurora R9</li><li>Product Brand  Alienware</li><li>Price  $800.00</li><li>Release Date  June 2019</li><li>Weight  39.2 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  18.9 x 8.77 x 17 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i5 9400</li><li>GPU  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650</li><li>RAM  8GB HyperX FURY DDR4</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-detailed-guide-to-screen-record-skype-via-obs/"><u>[New] Detailed Guide to Screen Record Skype via OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-cracking-the-code-calculating-your-income-from-youtubes-cpm/"><u>[Updated] Cracking the Code Calculating Your Income From YouTube's CPM</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-decoding-the-youtube-view-number-for-profitability/"><u>[Updated] Decoding the YouTube View Number for Profitability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-content-with-these-10-reaction-wonders/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Content with These 10 Reaction Wonders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/are-scalping-subscribers-a-viable-strategy-for-2024/"><u>Are Scalping Subscribers a Viable Strategy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/full-guide-on-mirroring-your-samsung-galaxy-m34-5g-to-your-pcmac-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Full Guide on Mirroring Your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G to Your PC/Mac | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-exit-android-factory-mode-on-poco-c50-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Exit Android Factory Mode On Poco C50? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-android-gallery-after-format-on-poco-m6-pro-5g-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/"><u>How to recover deleted photos from Android Gallery after format on Poco M6 Pro 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-whatsapp-from-iphone-8-plus-to-other-iphone-11-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios-transfer-whatsapp-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer WhatsApp From iPhone 8 Plus to other iPhone 11 devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-empowering-your-business-communication-google-meet-to-youtube-steps/"><u>In 2024, Empowering Your Business Communication Google Meet to YouTube Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-quieting-audible-outputs-a-windowsmac-guide/"><u>In 2024, Quieting Audible Outputs A Windows/Mac Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/must-play-biking-games-anthology/"><u>Must-Play Biking Games Anthology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/proven-techniques-for-captivating-viewers-with-live-video-graphics/"><u>Proven Techniques for Captivating Viewers with Live Video Graphics</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Stabilizers for YouTube</h4><p><strong>Selfie Stick:</strong> A lot of vloggers like to record from their phones, and selfie sticks make great stabilizers. You can put one end on the ground and use your selfie stick similarly to a monopod. Selfie sticks are also very affordable. The Cazbe Selfie Stick is only about $40. If you want to be a bit more sophisticated about your smartphone video then you might consider the KumbaCam 3 Axis Smart Phone Stabilizer, which is described as a ‘selfie stick on steroids’. It is a pricier option at $350.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment01.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Tripod:</strong> A tripod is what most people think of when they think of stabilizing their cameras. Tripods come in different weights and sizes, and there are even tripods specifically for smartphones. There is a wide range of pricing for tripods. Mid-range is about $50.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment02.JPG"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option!

Lighting for YouTube Videos"></a>2. Lighting for YouTube Videos</h4><p><strong>Softbox Lights:</strong> These are the kinds of lights that were probably used to take your school photos. They create soft, diffused, light and can be fairly affordable. The LimoStudio 700W Photography Softbox Lighting Kit is $167, and that is about the average.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment03.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>LED Panel Light:</strong> LED panels produce high quality light. Prices vary. The Aputure Amaran AL-528S LED Video Light costs $358 (with stand). There are also LED panel lights which can be mounted onto your camera, like the Julius Studio NEW 160 LED 160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Light which costs $111.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-equipment04.jpg"                      alt="youtube equipment"                ></p><p><strong>Free Option!

This helps them to develop a personal brand and add context to what their audience is about to see.</p><p>- Outro - It is the customized ending of the video where most content creators choose to add a call to action (CTA) encouraging them to engage with the channel or the video in some manner. For example, they may add an outro that asks the users to subscribe to the YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/intro-video-image-youtube.jpg"                      alt="intro-video-image-youtube"                ></p><ul><li><h4 id="Rich-Stickers-Titles"><a href="#Rich-Stickers-Titles" class="headerlink" title="Rich Stickers &amp; Titles"></a>Rich Stickers &amp; Titles</h4></li></ul><p>These are customized stickers, captions, and titles that enable YouTubers to add contextual information at any point in the video to add more value to their content during the process of cutting MP4 videos.

My YouTube Story</h3><p>On Monday, May 17th, 2010, YouTube celebrated its fifth anniversary. In celebration of hitting their five-year mark, YouTube launched a “My YouTube Story” campaign, which featured fifteen YouTubers sharing how YouTube has changed their lives. Each of these videos would end with “What’s your YouTube story? Tell us by uploading a video.” Ever since that campaign, many YouTubers have shared their YouTube story, including me! After I had been on YouTube for two years, I felt it was time for me to share my own YouTube story with the world. Sharing your story is not only an opportunity for your viewers to get to know you but a way to inspire other creators to start their channels as well. We all have our reasons for why we started, so why not share them?</p><h3 id="3-Draw-My-Life"><a href="#3-Draw-My-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Draw My Life"></a>3.  Draw My Life</h3><p>“Draw My Life” is a popular video where YouTubers share their life stories through a unique series of drawings. Often YouTubers use a white dry erase board and markers so they can erase and redraw the series of their life events. Mr. Kate provides a great example of this as she is a talented artist and DIY’er. The great thing about this is you don’t have to be an artist or a great drawer. It’s a fun way to be creative and tell your story.</p><h3 id="4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A"><a href="#4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A"></a>4.  Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram Stories Q&amp;A</h3><p>Who isn’t on Snapchat, Instagram, or both these days? Over the past year, I’ve seen YouTubers get creative by asking their viewers to send snaps asking questions they will answer on a Q &amp; A video on their channel. This video idea is great because it involves live viewer participation and a chance for viewers to be seen or noticed on their favorite Youtuber’s channels. Beauty guru stars Manny MUA and Jeffrey Star did a great example of this as a collaboration.</p><h3 id="5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A"><a href="#5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A"></a>5.  Never Have I Ever Q &amp; A</h3><p>Who hasn’t played the “Never Have I Ever” game?! Playing this game as a Q &amp; A is a great way for viewers to get to know you better with some juicy and shocking details about yourself they otherwise wouldn’t know. It’s also a great way to play and collaborate with another YouTuber. Often, the questions will be split and you have to watch both YouTubers’ videos to find out all the details. Highly popular beauty YouTuber Desi Perkins does a great example of this while playing the game with her sister in law.</p><h3 id="6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A"><a href="#6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A" class="headerlink" title="6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A"></a>6.  Get Ready With Me Q &amp; A</h3><p>Get ready with me Q &amp; As are some of my favorite videos to watch because it’s nice to see YouTubers strip-down bare-faced to do their makeup and answer popular questions. It often feels like two old friends sitting down to chat. Jenn, I’m doing a great example of this when she took to twitter asking viewers to ask her questions she would answer on her channel. Not only did she answer the questions but she gave a detailed makeup tutorial and explanation of the products she used as a 2 for 1. Even if your channel has nothing to do with makeup or fashion, some viewers can still be intrigued to learn more about your fashion and makeup style.</p><h3 id="7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story"><a href="#7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story" class="headerlink" title="7.

My Depression&#x2F;Anxiety or Mental Health Story</h3><p>Behind all their smiles and outrageous on-camera personas, there are a lot of YouTubers who are dealing with depression and anxiety. Beauty and fashion YouTuber Alyssa Forever not only shared her story on how she dealt with her depression but gave tips and ways to be happier. If you are facing depression, anxiety, or some other mental illness, it can give others hope if you share your story.</p><h3 id="8-Narrated-Autobiopic"><a href="#8-Narrated-Autobiopic" class="headerlink" title="8.  Narrated Autobiopic"></a>8.  Narrated Autobiopic</h3><p>Narrated Autobiopic videos are a great way to share your story or advice in a cinematic way. You can be as creative as you want to be. YouTuber Evelyn From the Internets posted a narrated autobiopic called “For People Who Feel Behind In Life” that comically introduces her story.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1492813">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1492813">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1492813.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1492813%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1492813/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag"><a href="#9-25-Facts-About-Me-Tag" class="headerlink" title="9.  25 Facts About Me Tag"></a>9.  25 Facts About Me Tag</h3><p>This is probably one of the easiest ways to share things about yourself when starting as a YouTuber or even if you’re a veteran. Viewers are always looking to learn more interesting things about you so you are more relatable. I’ve been a fan of Vasseur Beauty for a few years now and was surprised by many of the things she shared about herself.</p><h3 id="10-YouTube-Live-Webinar"><a href="#10-YouTube-Live-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="10.

My YouTube Story</h3><p>On Monday, May 17th, 2010, YouTube celebrated its fifth anniversary. In celebration of hitting their five-year mark, YouTube launched a “My YouTube Story” campaign, which featured fifteen YouTubers sharing how YouTube has changed their lives. Each of these videos would end with “What’s your YouTube story? Tell us by uploading a video.” Ever since that campaign, many YouTubers have shared their YouTube story, including me! After I had been on YouTube for two years, I felt it was time for me to share my own YouTube story with the world. Sharing your story is not only an opportunity for your viewers to get to know you but a way to inspire other creators to start their channels as well. We all have our reasons for why we started, so why not share them?</p><h3 id="3-Draw-My-Life-2"><a href="#3-Draw-My-Life-2" class="headerlink" title="3.  Draw My Life"></a>3.  Draw My Life</h3><p>“Draw My Life” is a popular video where YouTubers share their life stories through a unique series of drawings. Often YouTubers use a white dry erase board and markers so they can erase and redraw the series of their life events. Mr. Kate provides a great example of this as she is a talented artist and DIY’er. The great thing about this is you don’t have to be an artist or a great drawer. It’s a fun way to be creative and tell your story.</p><h3 id="4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A-2"><a href="#4-Snapchat-Instagram-Stories-Q-A-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

Over the past year, I’ve seen YouTubers get creative by asking their viewers to send snaps asking questions they will answer on a Q &amp; A video on their channel. This video idea is great because it involves live viewer participation and a chance for viewers to be seen or noticed on their favorite Youtuber’s channels. Beauty guru stars Manny MUA and Jeffrey Star did a great example of this as a collaboration.</p><h3 id="5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A-2"><a href="#5-Never-Have-I-Ever-Q-A-2" class="headerlink" title="5.

Playing this game as a Q &amp; A is a great way for viewers to get to know you better with some juicy and shocking details about yourself they otherwise wouldn’t know. It’s also a great way to play and collaborate with another YouTuber. Often, the questions will be split and you have to watch both YouTubers’ videos to find out all the details. Highly popular beauty YouTuber Desi Perkins does a great example of this while playing the game with her sister in law.</p><h3 id="6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A-2"><a href="#6-Get-Ready-With-Me-Q-A-2" class="headerlink" title="6.

It often feels like two old friends sitting down to chat. Jenn, I’m doing a great example of this when she took to twitter asking viewers to ask her questions she would answer on her channel. Not only did she answer the questions but she gave a detailed makeup tutorial and explanation of the products she used as a 2 for 1. Even if your channel has nothing to do with makeup or fashion, some viewers can still be intrigued to learn more about your fashion and makeup style.</p><h3 id="7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story-2"><a href="#7-My-Depression-Anxiety-or-Mental-Health-Story-2" class="headerlink" title="7.

If at any point you want to access a portion of the video you’ve trimmed you just have to <strong>extend the file by dragging it</strong> until you’re able to see the segment you’re searching for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Trimmer  Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Filmora-Split-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool"></a>Method 2: Using Filmora Split Tool</h4><p>Filmora’s <strong>Split tool</strong> can help you separate the portion of the clip you want to remove from the segment you’d like to keep. Simply <strong>place the playhead</strong> at the exact location in the video clip where you want to make <strong>a cut</strong>, and click on the <strong>Split icon</strong> that looks like a pair of scissors. After the video is split, you should click on the clip you no longer need in order to select it and then hit the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard to remove it from the timeline.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection-3"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Scene-Detection-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Scene Detection"></a>Method 3: Using Scene Detection</h4><p>Wondershare’s video editor also offers an <strong>automatic way to split a video</strong> clip into a number of separate scenes. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the video file located in the Filmora’s Media tab, and select the <strong>Scene Detection</strong> option from the menu and proceed to click on the <strong>Detect button</strong>, after the <strong>Scene Detection window</strong> pops up on the screen. The software will then <strong>automatically analyze the footage</strong> and divide it into separate scenes. Simply click on the <strong>Add to Timeline button</strong> once the process is completed to continue editing the video clip you’ve just split.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/scene-detection-interface.jpg"                      alt="Trim YouTube Videos with Filmora Scene Detection Tool"                ></p><h4 id="Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-4-Using-Instant-Cutter-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool"></a>Method 4: Using Instant Cutter Tool</h4><p>The <strong>Instant Cutter Tool</strong> enables you to quickly trim or merge high-resolution files recorded on action cameras as soon as you import them into a project in Filmora.

In the upper left corner of this window, you will be able to see <strong>Trim and Merge tabs</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>Trim tab</strong> is selected and then click on the <strong>Open File button</strong> to import a video clip you’d like to trim. You can then use <strong>the trimming sliders</strong> to designate the parts of the video you’d like to remove or the set the <strong>In and Out points</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Set In Point or Set Out Point icons</strong>.

If you want to be found and to be able to monetize your YouTube channel, you’re going to need to find your niche.</p><p>If you’re serious about turning your YouTube hobby into a lucrative career, you’re going to need a niche that not only lets you do the things you’re passionate about but which also gets you the views you need. The perfect niche will be something that your audience is already looking for, not ridiculously competitive, and which still allows you to demonstrate your passion and knowledge.</p><p>It’s not easy finding a perfect niche on YouTube. You’re going to need some creativity, self-awareness, directed intention, and a good deal of thought, so be prepared to invest some time and energy into this process. If you don’t get it right the first time, take a moment to figure out where you went wrong and just try again. Or you can try some influencer marketing platform such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to help you find your niche.

You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p><p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance. For example, if you’re keen to do cooking tutorials but spent a year traveling Asia, why not do Asian-inspired cooking? Or if you have a passion for fashion but work as a recruitment consultant, why not offer content about dressing for work and interviews?</p><p>This sweet spot where your passion and talents meet with your video genre is where you’ll find your ultimate niche lurking.</p><h2 id="Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?"></a>Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?</h2><p>Finding a niche is all about giving your viewers what they want to see. Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p><p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p><p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p><h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p><p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]"></a>How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]</h2><p>If you’re still at a loss of how to identify the best niche for your YouTube channel, let us help. Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p><ul><li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li></ul><p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p><p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pony-effect.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148649/16836" target="_top" id="2148649">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148649" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148649/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p><ul><li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li></ul><p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p><p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p><p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist. For example, if you narrow down your makeup search for ‘makeup tutorial for Asian male’, the results are in the region of 496k videos, a good deal less than the high-level outcome. If this was your passion, your talent and you could make great videos about it, you stand a good chance of breaking into this niche relatively easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-2.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li><strong>What will you do differently to other channels?</strong></li></ul><p>With so much content out there to view, you’re not going to make your millions on YouTube if you’re boring. Viewers know that fun, quality content is out there, and will seek to find someone better than you if you’re too ‘run of the mill’ for their taste. People come to YouTube for information, but stick around for personality, so inject some of yours into everything you do.</p><p>There are loads of ways you can bring excitement and engagement to your YouTube channel. Think about the way you look, the way you talk, how your introduction is made, the effects used in your video, the overall concept, the direction of the camera work… the possibilities for making unique and exciting videos are pretty much limitless, but you’ll need to get creative if you want to stand out from the crowd.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you make money in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>The majority of people start YouTube channels with big dreams of making millions from their work. However, if you’re in the wrong niche to start with, you could fall flat on your face before you even start. Researching whether it’s possible to monetize your YouTube niche is crucial; here’s how to find out:</p><ol><li>Will a company be likely to sponsor you to use their products?</li><li>Can you create a ‘side business’ alongside your channel?</li></ol><p>Sponsorship can be super lucrative, but very difficult to secure. Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal. The important thing is that you need to have a plan from the start.</p><p>Check out the most profitable niches for monetizing your YouTube channel below.</p><ul><li><strong>Can you generate enough content in this niche?</strong></li></ul><p>How many topics can you think of to make videos about for your channel? If you can’t think of at least 10 off the top of your head, that’s not a good sign. You’re going to need lots of ideas and inspiration for your YouTube videos, and if you’re already struggling to think of things to do, imagine how much you’ll be struggling two, three or four years down the line.</p><p>You need to absolutely love and be inspired by your niche because chances are you’ll be making videos on this topic for many years to come. Are you completely sure that you’ll be as enthusiastic about this topic next year? Will your passion for the content stand the test of time?

That’s not to say you should restrict yourself to only these niches, but if you’re stuck for inspiration, you’ll find these focused areas are a good place to start your search.</p><p><strong>#1 Makeup</strong></p><p>By far and away one of the most popular YouTube niches, makeup can be a great place to start. Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p><p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p><p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p><p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p><p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p><p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p><p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p><p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p><p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p><p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p><p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p><p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p><p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p><p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p><p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p><p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p><p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p><p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p><p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p><p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p><p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p><p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p><p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p><p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p><p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p><p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche. They tend to be highly immersed in the YouTube community, disclosing personal information about themselves and sharing their interests with their audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-9-smartphone-meeting-platforms-iphone-vs-android-comparison/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Top 9 Smartphone Meeting Platforms IPhone vs Android Comparison</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-discover-the-best-no-cost-soundtracks-for-video-production-for-2024/"><u>[New] Discover the Best No-Cost Soundtracks for Video Production for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-easy-process-extracting-youtube-media-directly/"><u>[New] In 2024, Easy Process Extracting YouTube Media Directly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-capture-your-screen-with-precision-and-orderly-guidance/"><u>[Updated] Capture Your Screen with Precision and Orderly Guidance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-carryminatis-income-evolution-with-ajey-nagar/"><u>[Updated] CarryMinati's Income Evolution with Ajey Nagar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/approved-drive-more-viewers-to-your-videos-top-growth-hacks/"><u>2024 Approved Drive More Viewers to Your Videos Top Growth Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhance-youtube-thumbnails-top-techniques-for-stunning-backdrops/"><u>2024 Approved Enhance YouTube Thumbnails Top Techniques for Stunning Backdrops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/a-full-review-for-itools-virtual-location-and-top-5-alternatives-for-apple-iphone-xsipad-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>A Full Review for iTools Virtual Location and Top 5 Alternatives For Apple iPhone XS/iPad | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/essential-collection-top-9-premium-wedding-movies-online/"><u>Essential Collection Top 9 Premium Wedding Movies Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/football-vids-premier-insights-into-youtube-tracks/"><u>Football Vids Premier Insights Into YouTube Tracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-automated-urls-for-youtube-subscriptions/"><u>In 2024, Automated URLs for YouTube Subscriptions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-direct-to-streamer-duel-choose-your-platform/"><u>In 2024, Direct-to-Streamer Duel Choose Your Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/skyrocket-your-income-on-youtube-the-power-of-500-loyal-fans/"><u>Skyrocket Your Income on Youtube The Power of 500 Loyal Fans</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
