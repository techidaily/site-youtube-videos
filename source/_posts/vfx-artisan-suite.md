### Embedding a YouTube Playlist on a Website Using oEmbed Code

Another method to embed a YouTube playlist on your WordPress website is to use oEmbed Code. This method requires basic CSS, HTML, or Java knowledge; otherwise, you won't be able to customize your playlist.

Moreover, this method is too complicated for beginners, and you will miss the customer support provided by WordPress plugin developers in case of any mishaps.

To use the oEmbed Code method, do the following steps:

Step1 In the first step, head to your YouTube account and access the Playlist you want to embed. Next, click the three dots below it and copy its URL.

Step2 Now, login to your WordPress dashboard and open the post or page editor where you want to add the playlist.

Step3 Paste the URL directly in the editor and click **"Update"** to save the changes.

WordPress will grab your playlist from YouTube and automatically show it in your post using oEmbed. The outcome is a single video with a menu that your viewers can click to see other videos in the playlist.

### Embedding a YouTube Playlist on WebsiteUsing <iframe >

Another way to embed a playlist of your YouTube channel on your WordPress site is by using the iFrame code with the following step-by-step instructions:

Step1 In the first step, launch a browser on your desktop or laptop and go to your **YouTube channel.**

Step2 Now, head to the YouTube playlist you want to embed, click the **"Share"** icon, and a pop-up window will appear.

Step3 Choose the **"Embed"** option, and a new lightbox pop-up will appear, having your playlist's embed code. Click **"Copy"** to save the code on your clipboard.

![embedding youtube playlist in website using iframe code](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/embedding-youtube-playlist-in-website-using-iframe-code.png)

Step4 Log in to your WordPress dashboard and open the page/post editor where you want to embed the playlist. Click the **"Plus"** icon, search for **"custom HTML,"** and select **"Custom HTML block"** to add to the page/post.

Now, paste the iFrame embed code you've copied from YouTube and click "Update" at the top-right of the screen to save the changes and embed your playlist.

This method will also display one video with a menu from where you and your website viewers can access the playlist. Moreover, there are few customization options to change the appearance.
