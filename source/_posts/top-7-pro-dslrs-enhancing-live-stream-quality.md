 | ![ canon t7i](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel3.png)      | Best daily DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS T7i The camera you use to record your daily vlogs doesn't have to be the best camera on the market. It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  **PROS** _\- Long battery life_ _\- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values_   **CONS** _\- Can’t record 4K videos_ _\- Viewfinder is tiny_          |

| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png)       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you'll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_ |
| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png)         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera's great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There's a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you'll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                             |

 | ![ canon t7i](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel3.png)      | Best daily DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS T7i The camera you use to record your daily vlogs doesn't have to be the best camera on the market. It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  **PROS** _\- Long battery life_ _\- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values_   **CONS** _\- Can’t record 4K videos_ _\- Viewfinder is tiny_          |

| ![Canon SL2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png)       | Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you'll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  **PROS** _\- Microphone jack_ _\- Wi-Fi connectivity_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video support_ _\- Optical image stabilizer could be better_ |
| ![Canon 80D](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png)         | Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera's great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png) | Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There's a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you'll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas). The 6D Mark II also has great battery life compared to all the reviewed cameras above. Unfortunately, this camera does not shoot in 4K.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                             |

In this article, we’re going to explore some of the best cameras for YouTube. We’ll label each one based on what we believe is best for particular uses, so that you can better parse what it is that you want to purchase. All of this is in hopes that you can find the video camera for YouTube that is right for you and what you need.

* [**Part 1: 7 Best Best Camera for Youtube to Make Videos**](#best-camera-for-youtube)
* [**Part 2: Frequently Asked Questions**](#faq)

## Part 1: 7 Best Best Camera for Youtube to Make Videos

### 1\. [Sony DSC WX350 Digital Camera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I8BIBB8/ref=twister%5FB00IG1ZEWO?%5Fencoding=UTF8&psc=1) – Best Point and Shoot Video Camera

![Sony DSC WX350 Digital Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sony-dsc-wx350.JPG)

**Specifications:**

* 40x clear image zoom; 20x optical zoom
* Lock-on Auto Focus
* Wi-Fi with NFC3 connectivity for mobile devices
* 4 megapixels
* CMOS sensor that provides top quality images, even in low lighting
* Motion shot video with up to 4k quality output

**Description:** Have you been looking for a 20x zoom camera that [fits in your pocket](https://www.dpmag.com/cameras/compact/the-best-camera-is-the-one-that-fits-in-a-pocket-but-its-not-your-phone/)? Get the best pictures with the Sony DSC WX350\. This camera offers both still photos and video recording, using technology that minimizes how much the camera shakes, even if you’re filming on the go.

**Pros:** The image stabilizer makes this one of the best cameras for making YouTube videos out there, alongside of the 20x optical zoom. The battery life is quite long as well, which means you can get a lot of content done without any problems. Lastly, you can film in HD, which makes any YouTube influencer happy.

**Cons:** The LED screen can be quite dim, so it’s hard to see it when you’re out in bright sunlight; be sure you make adjustments before you go outside. There is also not your typical viewfinder installed, so experienced videographers may not like using it.

### 2\. [GoPro HERO8 Action Camera](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Waterproof-Accessory-Batteries-MicroSDHC/dp/B082MQFG76/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?crid=161JHBT1AHB2A&keywords=gopro+hero+8&qid=1583984353&sprefix=gopro%2Caps%2C363&sr=8-3) \- Best Wearable Sports Camera

![GoPro HERO8 Action Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/gopro-8.JPG)

**Specifications:**

* Up to 60 FPS
* 4k and HD capabilities
* HyperSmooth 2.0 stabilization options.
* Optional Battery Mod available.
* Integrated Mount
* Crisp, easy to use and navigate LCD.

**Description:** If you need an on-the-go video camera for YouTube, there’s nothing better than a GoPro. With their HERO series of GoPros, they have all sorts of great features that allow you to capture the smoothest video, even when you’re out and on the go. Their [top end stabilization](https://fstoppers.com/apps/best-way-stabilize-your-gopro-heros-footage-391418) makes their cameras the best for the active YouTuber.

**Pros:** The rugged, waterproof design of the HERO7 is a great option for anyone who is looking to be on the go with their YouTube. The integrated mount makes it simple for anyone who wants to put it on a selfie stick or something else, and it even has a companion app for easy, on the go editing!

**Cons:** The Wi-Fi capabilities are great, but the video transfer can take a bit of time due to how large the files may be. So, if you’re uploading the transfer, you may want to consider using the USB port instead. Also, the memory card slot is in an awkward place near the mount, so those with larger fingers may have trouble putting a card in there.

### 3\. [Logitech BRIO HD Webcam for Video](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-BRIO-Conferencing-Recording-Streaming/dp/B01N5UOYC4/ref=sr%5F1%5F6?keywords=Logitech+camera&qid=1583984539&sr=8-6) – Best Video Recording and Streaming Camera

![Logitech BRIO HD Webcam for Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/logitech-brio.JPG)

**Specifications:**

* 5x zoom
* Premium glass lens
* 4k image sensor for videoing and HDR with autofocus
* Light exposure automatically adjusts for whatever lighting that you’re filming in.
* Streaming and recording available.
* Enterprise ready for any use.
* Plug and play software automatically installs upon first use.
* Cover clip so you can cover the camera quickly, when needed.

**Description:** If you need an easy to use, simple to install option for filming and streaming from your computer, then this Logitech is the best camera for YouTube videos of this type. With multiple features and a design that has been made for streamers like you, you’ll always be able to just turn it on, make adjustments with ease, and get streaming in no time.

**Pros:** The camera is incredibly easy to use and install; it connects to your PC with a USB type C to USB type 3.0 cord (backwards compatible to 2.0). You can easily tinker with all of the settings and such in the included software.

**Cons:** The arm is designed for thick edges; those with flat monitors or borderless monitors may find that it’s difficult to attach it to your monitor. The software is easy to use, but it’s missing a handful of settings that more experienced streamers would want to have available. There is a crop out background feature, but it can be hard to find and use.

### 4\. [PANASONIC Lumix G7 4K Digital Camera](https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Digital-Megapixel-Mirrorless-DMC-G7KK/dp/B00X409PQS/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?keywords=best+mirrorless+camera+for+youtube&qid=1583984713&sr=8-4) \- Best Mirrorless Camera for Professionals

![PANASONIC Lumix G7 4K Digital Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/panasonic-lumix-g7-camera.JPG)

**Specifications:**

* 16 megapixels
* No pass filter with four thirds sensor
* Wi-Fi capability
* 4k and HD video capture available at 30 frames per second.
* Aperture and shutter settings are adjusted via knobs, not menus.
* 3 inch tilt and swivel display
* High resolution viewfinder

**Description:** If you want to have professional looking photos and videos, the PANASONIC Lumix G7 4K is a solid choice for a mirrorless camera. All of the controls make it easy to get things the way that you want it, and it comes with multiple ports so that you can plug it into any device and get it ready to go.

**Pros:** This one of the best 4k video options out there, and you don’t need to spend an arm and a leg on it. The dual control dials and the variable touch LCD allow for maximum control, making it simple to film what you want with minimal editing after you’ve filmed.

**Cons:** There is a tracking focus, which can be good, but it makes the burst rate (which helps with motion blur) a lot slower. It does have a plastic build, rather than metal, so it’s not as heavy duty as other options. And, you need to purchase it with everything included, instead of just purchasing the body.

### 5\. [Sony CX405 Full HD](https://www.amazon.com/HDRCX405-Recording-Handycam-Camcorder-Battery/dp/B00HZ26X34/ref=sr%5F1%5F17?keywords=cam+recorder+sony&qid=1583985040&sr=8-17) \- Best Camcorder (Only) for Video

![Sony CX405 Full HD](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sony-cx405.JPG)

**Specifications:**

* 60x clear image zoom with Zeiss Lens
* 50 Mbps XAVC
* MP4 and AVCHD codecs
* SteadyShot image stabilization
* Built-in USB cable
* Face detection and noise reduction
* 7 picture effects for video

## Part 1: 7 Best Best Camera for Youtube to Make Videos

### 1\. [Sony DSC WX350 Digital Camera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I8BIBB8/ref=twister%5FB00IG1ZEWO?%5Fencoding=UTF8&psc=1) – Best Point and Shoot Video Camera

![Sony DSC WX350 Digital Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sony-dsc-wx350.JPG)

* 4 megapixels
* CMOS sensor that provides top quality images, even in low lighting
* Motion shot video with up to 4k quality output

**Description:** Have you been looking for a 20x zoom camera that [fits in your pocket](https://www.dpmag.com/cameras/compact/the-best-camera-is-the-one-that-fits-in-a-pocket-but-its-not-your-phone/)? Get the best pictures with the Sony DSC WX350\. This camera offers both still photos and video recording, using technology that minimizes how much the camera shakes, even if you’re filming on the go.

**Pros:** The image stabilizer makes this one of the best cameras for making YouTube videos out there, alongside of the 20x optical zoom. The battery life is quite long as well, which means you can get a lot of content done without any problems. Lastly, you can film in HD, which makes any YouTube influencer happy.

**Cons:** The LED screen can be quite dim, so it’s hard to see it when you’re out in bright sunlight; be sure you make adjustments before you go outside. There is also not your typical viewfinder installed, so experienced videographers may not like using it.

### 2\. [GoPro HERO8 Action Camera](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Waterproof-Accessory-Batteries-MicroSDHC/dp/B082MQFG76/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?crid=161JHBT1AHB2A&keywords=gopro+hero+8&qid=1583984353&sprefix=gopro%2Caps%2C363&sr=8-3) \- Best Wearable Sports Camera

With their HERO series of GoPros, they have all sorts of great features that allow you to capture the smoothest video, even when you’re out and on the go. Their [top end stabilization](https://fstoppers.com/apps/best-way-stabilize-your-gopro-heros-footage-391418) makes their cameras the best for the active YouTuber.

**Pros:** The rugged, waterproof design of the HERO7 is a great option for anyone who is looking to be on the go with their YouTube. The integrated mount makes it simple for anyone who wants to put it on a selfie stick or something else, and it even has a companion app for easy, on the go editing!

**Cons:** The Wi-Fi capabilities are great, but the video transfer can take a bit of time due to how large the files may be. So, if you’re uploading the transfer, you may want to consider using the USB port instead. Also, the memory card slot is in an awkward place near the mount, so those with larger fingers may have trouble putting a card in there.

### 3\. [Logitech BRIO HD Webcam for Video](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-BRIO-Conferencing-Recording-Streaming/dp/B01N5UOYC4/ref=sr%5F1%5F6?keywords=Logitech+camera&qid=1583984539&sr=8-6) – Best Video Recording and Streaming Camera

**Pros:** The camera is incredibly easy to use and install; it connects to your PC with a USB type C to USB type 3.0 cord (backwards compatible to 2.0). You can easily tinker with all of the settings and such in the included software.

**Cons:** The arm is designed for thick edges; those with flat monitors or borderless monitors may find that it’s difficult to attach it to your monitor. The software is easy to use, but it’s missing a handful of settings that more experienced streamers would want to have available. There is a crop out background feature, but it can be hard to find and use.

### 4\. [PANASONIC Lumix G7 4K Digital Camera](https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Digital-Megapixel-Mirrorless-DMC-G7KK/dp/B00X409PQS/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?keywords=best+mirrorless+camera+for+youtube&qid=1583984713&sr=8-4) \- Best Mirrorless Camera for Professionals

**Cons:** There is a tracking focus, which can be good, but it makes the burst rate (which helps with motion blur) a lot slower. It does have a plastic build, rather than metal, so it’s not as heavy duty as other options. And, you need to purchase it with everything included, instead of just purchasing the body.

### 5\. [Sony CX405 Full HD](https://www.amazon.com/HDRCX405-Recording-Handycam-Camcorder-Battery/dp/B00HZ26X34/ref=sr%5F1%5F17?keywords=cam+recorder+sony&qid=1583985040&sr=8-17) \- Best Camcorder (Only) for Video
