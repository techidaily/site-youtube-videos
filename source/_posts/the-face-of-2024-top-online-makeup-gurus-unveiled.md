Zoe is better known for her online pseudonym Zoella. She started her career as a blogger in 2009\.

* **[Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance](#part4)**

## Part 1: Get More Views by Adding Shorts Video to the â€˜Featuredâ€™ Section

Comparatively different from other videos, the ones that are added under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ section are recommended to the audience throughout the YouTube platform on the basis of the algorithms that automatically determine which clips should be liked beach viewer individually.

To elaborate, generally, YouTube suggests you a video as per your viewing history, browsing statistics, and other such information that the streaming media giant collects over time. On the other hand, the â€˜Featuredâ€™ videos are suggested according to what YouTube â€˜thinksâ€™ might be of your interest, or could be somehow useful to you.

Therefore, when any clip is added as a â€˜Featuredâ€™ video, YouTube suggests it to more viewers as compared to those that are published under the â€˜Recommendedâ€™ category.

**Note:** Although there is a lot more to cover under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ videos and channels section such as branding, advertisements, etc., such topics are beyond the scope of this piece.

Adding YouTube Shorts videos to the â€˜Featuredâ€™ section is fairly simple, and the instructions given below explain how this can be done:

**Note:** It is assumed that you already have a couple of shorts video published on YouTube.

**Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section**

Go to YouTube on your PCâ€™s web browser, sign in to your Google account, click **Your videos** from the navigation bar in the left, and click **Customization** from the left bar when the **Studio** page opens up.

![ Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-customization.jpg)

**Step 2: Add YouTube Shorts**

Click **ADD SECTION** from the **Layout** tab in the right window, and click **Short videos** from the list that appears next to add the YouTube Shorts category.

![Add Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-add-section.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Short videos to Featured sections and Save the Changes**

Hold the **Short videos** bar from the moving handle at the left, and move it right below the **Featured sections** segment. Once the **Short videos** category is in the right place, click **PUBLISH** from the top-right corner of the page to save the changes. From this point onward, any YouTube Shorts video that you publish on your channel will be automatically added as â€˜Featuredâ€™ after its approval.

![Publish Added Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-featured-section.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The thumbnails are the face of the videos that you publish anywhere online. Therefore, it is imperative to take down the default one that is automatically added by YouTube, and add your own, custom image instead.

To have your own thumbnail, you can either pick any frame from within the video itself, or you can upload a separate photo from your PC, and replace the existing one with it.

**Things to Consider** **for creating attractive thumbnail**

While using your custom image as a thumbnail for your YouTube Shots videos, a few things that you should keep in mind include:

* **Relevance**

Make sure that the new photo that you are planning to use as a thumbnail is relevant to the short video. Any image that is out of context might confuse the viewers, and you may lose your audience and the subscribers forever and for good.

* **Clarity**

Always use an image with clear content and large text (if any). This lets the viewers easily determine whether the video is of their interest.

* **Correctness**

You should avoid using misleading images as thumbnails. While such photos would attract more viewers initially, people will gradually lose trust in your channel if they do not find what they expect by the glimpse of the thumbnail.

## Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The fact of the matter is, YouTube Shorts videos arenâ€™t much different that any other video that you publish on the platform. Therefore, the process of optimizing both short and regular videos is identical.

A few things that are extremely important, and play a vital role in optimizing YouTube Shorts videos include:

* **Attractive Thumbnail**

As mentioned above, the thumbnail of a video is its face, and the prettier and appealing the face is the more audience will it attract, and the more hits your video will get. Therefore, ensure to make the thumbnail of your short videos as attractive as you possibly can.

* **Compelling Title**

The title says it all. Your short videos will have good chances of getting noticed and hits if they have an impulsive and compelling title that can give the viewers a summary of what they can expect from the clip.

* **Detailed Description**

The description of your short videos should be complete, and must explain the theme, genre, and nature of the clip. With the detailed description, the viewers will be able to assess if the video would be helpful to them in some manner.

* **Tags**

Make sure to add relevant tags to your short videos. For instance, adding â€˜#Shortsâ€™ in the title or description of the video tells YouTube that the clip is created for YouTube Shorts. Likewise, other tags that are related to the genre and/or theme of the short videos help YouTube suggest your media to the relevant audiences across the website.

## Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance

YouTube Shorts are videos that are no more than 60 seconds long in length. When added under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ category, you can see a significant amount of increment in the hits, and therefore the view count and the playback duration of your YouTube channel gets directly affected.

However, because these short videos cannot be monetized, at times you may notice that even though the total playback duration and view counts of your YouTube channel are high, your earnings may not be as much as what you would receive if those clips were published as regular videos.

**FAQ: Will YouTube Shorts Performance Impact Other YouTube Stats?**

Yes. As mentioned above, the view counts and playback durations of YouTube Shorts videos are added to your channelâ€™s statistics. Therefore, with the number of views your short videos get, the overall performance of your YouTube stats is affected accordingly.

To elaborate, generally, YouTube suggests you a video as per your viewing history, browsing statistics, and other such information that the streaming media giant collects over time. On the other hand, the â€˜Featuredâ€™ videos are suggested according to what YouTube â€˜thinksâ€™ might be of your interest, or could be somehow useful to you.

Therefore, when any clip is added as a â€˜Featuredâ€™ video, YouTube suggests it to more viewers as compared to those that are published under the â€˜Recommendedâ€™ category.

**Note:** Although there is a lot more to cover under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ videos and channels section such as branding, advertisements, etc., such topics are beyond the scope of this piece.

Adding YouTube Shorts videos to the â€˜Featuredâ€™ section is fairly simple, and the instructions given below explain how this can be done:

**Note:** It is assumed that you already have a couple of shorts video published on YouTube.

**Step 1: Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section**

Go to YouTube on your PCâ€™s web browser, sign in to your Google account, click **Your videos** from the navigation bar in the left, and click **Customization** from the left bar when the **Studio** page opens up.

![ Get to YouTube Studio Customization Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-customization.jpg)

**Step 2: Add YouTube Shorts**

Click **ADD SECTION** from the **Layout** tab in the right window, and click **Short videos** from the list that appears next to add the YouTube Shorts category.

![Add Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-more-views-featured-section-add-section.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Short videos to Featured sections and Save the Changes**

Hold the **Short videos** bar from the moving handle at the left, and move it right below the **Featured sections** segment. Once the **Short videos** category is in the right place, click **PUBLISH** from the top-right corner of the page to save the changes. From this point onward, any YouTube Shorts video that you publish on your channel will be automatically added as â€˜Featuredâ€™ after its approval.

![Publish Added Section in Featured Section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/publish-featured-section.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Attractive Thumbnail for YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The thumbnails are the face of the videos that you publish anywhere online. Therefore, it is imperative to take down the default one that is automatically added by YouTube, and add your own, custom image instead.

To have your own thumbnail, you can either pick any frame from within the video itself, or you can upload a separate photo from your PC, and replace the existing one with it.

**Things to Consider** **for creating attractive thumbnail**

While using your custom image as a thumbnail for your YouTube Shots videos, a few things that you should keep in mind include:

* **Relevance**

Make sure that the new photo that you are planning to use as a thumbnail is relevant to the short video. Any image that is out of context might confuse the viewers, and you may lose your audience and the subscribers forever and for good.

* **Clarity**

Always use an image with clear content and large text (if any). This lets the viewers easily determine whether the video is of their interest.

* **Correctness**

You should avoid using misleading images as thumbnails. While such photos would attract more viewers initially, people will gradually lose trust in your channel if they do not find what they expect by the glimpse of the thumbnail.

## Part 3: Optimize YouTube Shorts to Get More Views

The fact of the matter is, YouTube Shorts videos arenâ€™t much different that any other video that you publish on the platform. Therefore, the process of optimizing both short and regular videos is identical.

A few things that are extremely important, and play a vital role in optimizing YouTube Shorts videos include:

* **Attractive Thumbnail**

As mentioned above, the thumbnail of a video is its face, and the prettier and appealing the face is the more audience will it attract, and the more hits your video will get. Therefore, ensure to make the thumbnail of your short videos as attractive as you possibly can.

* **Compelling Title**

The title says it all. Your short videos will have good chances of getting noticed and hits if they have an impulsive and compelling title that can give the viewers a summary of what they can expect from the clip.

* **Detailed Description**

The description of your short videos should be complete, and must explain the theme, genre, and nature of the clip. With the detailed description, the viewers will be able to assess if the video would be helpful to them in some manner.

* **Tags**

Make sure to add relevant tags to your short videos. For instance, adding â€˜#Shortsâ€™ in the title or description of the video tells YouTube that the clip is created for YouTube Shorts. Likewise, other tags that are related to the genre and/or theme of the short videos help YouTube suggest your media to the relevant audiences across the website.

## Part 4: How to Analyze YouTube Shorts Performance

YouTube Shorts are videos that are no more than 60 seconds long in length. When added under the â€˜Featuredâ€™ category, you can see a significant amount of increment in the hits, and therefore the view count and the playback duration of your YouTube channel gets directly affected.

However, because these short videos cannot be monetized, at times you may notice that even though the total playback duration and view counts of your YouTube channel are high, your earnings may not be as much as what you would receive if those clips were published as regular videos.

**FAQ: Will YouTube Shorts Performance Impact Other YouTube Stats?**

Yes. As mentioned above, the view counts and playback durations of YouTube Shorts videos are added to your channelâ€™s statistics. Therefore, with the number of views your short videos get, the overall performance of your YouTube stats is affected accordingly.
