Only one thing will disappoint you; you can never multiple videos at once.

**Step 1:** [Download ListenOnRepeat](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/listen-on-repeat-youtube/pgjcgpbffennccofdpganblbjiglnbip) from Google Chrome extension.

**Step 2:** After you’ve downloaded and installed, search the video you want to watch repeatedly at the search bar at the top of the app.

**Step 3:** Click the selected video and it will be replayed continuously.

#### **#Extension 2:** [**Kapwing**](https://www.kapwing.com/tools/loop-video)

Kapwing is the extension to go for if you want to make YouTube videos longer, create a loop on your snaps and make a cinemagraph.

Some of the advanced features are on paid plans and just a few are available for free. You can trim and cut any unwanted parts of the video to replay. This extension allows you to set the number of loops to watch.

Like the other Google Chrome extension video lopper, open the extension, search for URL to watch on repeat and pest its URL and it will play on loop.

#### **#Extension 3:** [**InfiniteLooper**](https://www.infinitelooper.com/)

![How to Loop YouTube Video: Only on PC](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-loop-youtube-video-extension-infinitelooper.jpg)

This app will make you glued to the computer with infinite loops on the best part of the YouTube video. Whether you want to watch the full video on repeat or a specific part, the infinite loop should be your choice.

However, this is not a to- go-for app if you intend to watch the video later without spending a single byte. To solve this problem, use a video downloader and with [**Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) edit the video as much as you want then save it to your library.

It’s not common to be attracted to only one video. InfiniteLooper designers never thought of this. You have to use other technologies to play two YouTube videos at once.
