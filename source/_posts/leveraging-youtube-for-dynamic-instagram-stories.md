## How to Post a YouTube Video on Instagram

Sharing YouTube videos to Instagram directly isn't possible yet, and for that reason, if you want to feature YouTube videos on your Instagram you'll have to go through a three-step process. However, this process is fairly simple, although some methods may be more complex than others and require you to spend a considerable amount of time on downloading and editing the files you want to share on your Instagram account.

* [Step 1: Download Videos from YouTube](#step1)
* [Step 2: Edit and Convert Your Files](#step2)
* [Step 3: Upload the Videos to Instagram](#step3)

### Step 1: Download Videos from YouTube

In order to post a YouTube video to Instagram, you have to download the video you want to share, adjust it to the platform's video requirements, and then finally upload it.

#### 1\. Downloading YouTube video to your PC

There are several different methods you can use to download a YouTube video to your computer, but using websites such as [ClipConverter](https://www.clipconverter.cc/), [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/), or [OnlineVideoConverter](https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/video-converter) that enable you to download and convert video files is probably one of the easiest and fastest ways to achieve your goal.

1. Choose one of the reliable online downloaders mentioned above and simply paste the video's URL into its input box.
2. Figure out which video format you'd like to convert the YouTube video and MP4 file extension is advised because it is most frequently used for Instagram videos.
3. The online converter will either enable you to download the files directly to a hard drive on your PC or to send the links of the converted video files to your email.

#### 2\. Downloading YouTube videos to a mobile device

**Download instructions for iPhones:** The process of downloading videos from YouTube with iPhones or iPads is not very simple because you'll have to go through several stages of the process before you can view the video file from your device.

1. After installing the [Documents 6](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents-by-readdle/id364901807?mt=8) app, launch the app and use its web browser, an icon that looks like a compass, to navigate to the[Savefrom.net](http://en.savefrom.net/1-how-to-download-youtube-video/).
2. You can copy the link of the YouTube video, by launching the YouTube app on your iPhone, accessing the Share option, and selecting the Copy Link feature. Alternatively, you can launch the Safari web browser on your device, play the YouTube video you'd like to download, and copy the URL of the video you'd like to download.
3. After you've copied the YouTube link, head back to the Documents 6 app and paste the link to the input box on the [Savefrom.net](http://en.savefrom.net/1-how-to-download-youtube-video/) window, you've already opened in the Documents 6 app. You'll be able to choose from several size options, like 1280p or 480p.
4. Select the file size that best suits the purpose for which you are going to use the video, and then proceed to tap on the Download option, and select Done to start downloading the YouTube video file.
5. Go to the Downloads menu in the Documents 6 app and locate the video you just downloaded. Tap and hold the file, and drag it upward until you spot the folder list. Access the Photos app from the folder list and place the file in the Camera Roll.

 **Download instructions for Android devices:**  YouTube video files are much easier to download from Android Smartphones since you can find a number of different apps that will enable you to download the files you want to share directly from YouTube.

However, Google, like Apple isn't too keen on apps that let you download YouTube videos freely, which is the reason why you'll have to spend some time looking for the right app.

If you have trouble finding the right app for the job on Google Play you can try getting [TubeMate](http://tubemate.net/) from the app's official website.

### Step 2: Edit and Convert the Files to Meet Instagram's Video Requirements

As you probably know the maximum duration of a video on Instagram is limited to one minute, which means that you'll probably have to cut the parts of a YouTube video you downloaded in order to be able to post it on your Instagram account.

This process will be much easier if you use a PC or Mac-based video editing software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) because changing the video file extension or the duration of a video will be much quicker and simpler than if you opt to use some of the[video editing apps that are available for iPhones](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Android Smartphones.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

However, if you would still like to go through the process of editing the YouTube video you'd like to post on Instagram directly from the Smartphone you can use apps like [iMovie](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8), [Videoshop,](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/videoshop-video-editor/id615563599?mt=8)or[Filmora](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.filmorago&hl=en)to change the duration of the video.

Altering the file extension of a video to commonly used mp4 files and the size of 1080 pixels X 566 pixels may prove to be a little more complicated than it would be with a PC or Mac-based video editing software.

### Step 3: Upload the video to Instagram

Here comes the final step of posting YouTube videos to Instagram. The file you want to post should be already placed on your Camera Roll, so you just need to launch the Instagram app from your Android phone or iPhone and click on the + icon located on the app's toolbar at the bottom of the screen.

Select the Library option, and tap on the video file you'd like to post to your Instagram account. Click on Next and proceed to add a description to your post as well as tags that will enable your video to reach a wider audience.

It is important to keep in mind that posting YouTube videos you don't have permission to use on your Instagram account is not advisable because copyright infringement is a serious offense that may result in severe penalties.

Being unique and producing the content specifically made for Instagram is a much better and much safer option at this point until Instagram decides to make sharing YouTube videos a simple process that requires you to just click on the Share button below the YouTube video you want to share to Instagram.

The video tutorial below shows you how to edit and export video clips for sharing on Instagram. Watch it and learn how to add extra filters and visual effects to make it more fantastic.

## How to Post a YouTube Video on Instagram

Sharing YouTube videos to Instagram directly isn't possible yet, and for that reason, if you want to feature YouTube videos on your Instagram you'll have to go through a three-step process. However, this process is fairly simple, although some methods may be more complex than others and require you to spend a considerable amount of time on downloading and editing the files you want to share on your Instagram account.

* [Step 1: Download Videos from YouTube](#step1)
* [Step 2: Edit and Convert Your Files](#step2)
* [Step 3: Upload the Videos to Instagram](#step3)

### Step 1: Download Videos from YouTube

In order to post a YouTube video to Instagram, you have to download the video you want to share, adjust it to the platform's video requirements, and then finally upload it.

#### 1\. Downloading YouTube video to your PC

There are several different methods you can use to download a YouTube video to your computer, but using websites such as [ClipConverter](https://www.clipconverter.cc/), [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/), or [OnlineVideoConverter](https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/video-converter) that enable you to download and convert video files is probably one of the easiest and fastest ways to achieve your goal.

1. Choose one of the reliable online downloaders mentioned above and simply paste the video's URL into its input box.
2. Figure out which video format you'd like to convert the YouTube video and MP4 file extension is advised because it is most frequently used for Instagram videos.
3. The online converter will either enable you to download the files directly to a hard drive on your PC or to send the links of the converted video files to your email.

#### 2\. Downloading YouTube videos to a mobile device

**Download instructions for iPhones:** The process of downloading videos from YouTube with iPhones or iPads is not very simple because you'll have to go through several stages of the process before you can view the video file from your device.

1. After installing the [Documents 6](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents-by-readdle/id364901807?mt=8) app, launch the app and use its web browser, an icon that looks like a compass, to navigate to the[Savefrom.net](http://en.savefrom.net/1-how-to-download-youtube-video/).
2. You can copy the link of the YouTube video, by launching the YouTube app on your iPhone, accessing the Share option, and selecting the Copy Link feature. Alternatively, you can launch the Safari web browser on your device, play the YouTube video you'd like to download, and copy the URL of the video you'd like to download.
3. After you've copied the YouTube link, head back to the Documents 6 app and paste the link to the input box on the [Savefrom.net](http://en.savefrom.net/1-how-to-download-youtube-video/) window, you've already opened in the Documents 6 app. You'll be able to choose from several size options, like 1280p or 480p.
4. Select the file size that best suits the purpose for which you are going to use the video, and then proceed to tap on the Download option, and select Done to start downloading the YouTube video file.
5. Go to the Downloads menu in the Documents 6 app and locate the video you just downloaded. Tap and hold the file, and drag it upward until you spot the folder list. Access the Photos app from the folder list and place the file in the Camera Roll.

 **Download instructions for Android devices:**  YouTube video files are much easier to download from Android Smartphones since you can find a number of different apps that will enable you to download the files you want to share directly from YouTube.

However, Google, like Apple isn't too keen on apps that let you download YouTube videos freely, which is the reason why you'll have to spend some time looking for the right app.

If you have trouble finding the right app for the job on Google Play you can try getting [TubeMate](http://tubemate.net/) from the app's official website.

### Step 2: Edit and Convert the Files to Meet Instagram's Video Requirements

As you probably know the maximum duration of a video on Instagram is limited to one minute, which means that you'll probably have to cut the parts of a YouTube video you downloaded in order to be able to post it on your Instagram account.

This process will be much easier if you use a PC or Mac-based video editing software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) because changing the video file extension or the duration of a video will be much quicker and simpler than if you opt to use some of the[video editing apps that are available for iPhones](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Android Smartphones.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

However, if you would still like to go through the process of editing the YouTube video you'd like to post on Instagram directly from the Smartphone you can use apps like [iMovie](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8), [Videoshop,](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/videoshop-video-editor/id615563599?mt=8)or[Filmora](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.filmorago&hl=en)to change the duration of the video.

Altering the file extension of a video to commonly used mp4 files and the size of 1080 pixels X 566 pixels may prove to be a little more complicated than it would be with a PC or Mac-based video editing software.

### Step 3: Upload the video to Instagram

Here comes the final step of posting YouTube videos to Instagram. The file you want to post should be already placed on your Camera Roll, so you just need to launch the Instagram app from your Android phone or iPhone and click on the + icon located on the app's toolbar at the bottom of the screen.

Select the Library option, and tap on the video file you'd like to post to your Instagram account. Click on Next and proceed to add a description to your post as well as tags that will enable your video to reach a wider audience.

It is important to keep in mind that posting YouTube videos you don't have permission to use on your Instagram account is not advisable because copyright infringement is a serious offense that may result in severe penalties.

Being unique and producing the content specifically made for Instagram is a much better and much safer option at this point until Instagram decides to make sharing YouTube videos a simple process that requires you to just click on the Share button below the YouTube video you want to share to Instagram.

## Cheap Microphones for Youtubers on a Budget

# Cheap Microphones for Youtubers on a Budget

An expensive microphone doesnâ€™t mean it is the best option â€” at least, not for YouTubers. Without professional experience or additional equipment, having a $1000 studio microphone could be wasted money.

If you are on a budget or new to YouTube, and what you want is to improve the audio quality of your video gradually, you should look into the cheaper options first.

In this article, I will highlight microphones in 3 price ranges.

 [Under $20](#twenty)

[Under $50](#fifty)

[Under $100](#hundred)

  We will have a look at each of these microphones, their pros, and cons, and then you can decide which one will be best for your channel and your budget.

As for keeping with your financial needs, we arenâ€™t going to be looking at any XLR microphones, as they will require an audio interface, thus increasing your price range. The microphones in this list will be plug-and-plays, and you will only need the [basic audio recording skills](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get started.

**Disclaimer:** Prices are subjected to change.

## **YouTube Microphones for Under $20**

#### **BOYA BY-M1 - $16.99**

**The[BOYA BY-M1](https://www.amazon.com/BOYA-Microphone-Windscreen-Windshield-Smartphones/dp/B01M2VC8GF/) is a lavalier microphone (a hand-free mic that clips onto your clothing) that connects to smartphones, DSLR, computers, and other audio recorders.**

![boya-by-m1](https://images.wondershare.com/boya-by-m1.jpg)

**Pro**: As an omnidirectional condenser microphone, it will be able to pick up audio from 360 degrees, and with 20 feet (6 meters) of cable, you can have a significant range movement even if you are connected to the camera.

The BOYA BY-M1 is a terrific choice for YouTubers on a budget that is frequently making videos on the go. Itâ€™s easy to carry around, and the ability to simply connect to a smartphone means you can set up and shoot your video on the fly.

**Con**: This mic, although it has a great range, can also pick up subtle movements you make as it is clipped onto you. Not great if there is a lot of action in your videos.

#### **TONOR PC Microphone Computer Condenser - $15.99**

**The [TONOR](https://www.amazon.com/TONOR-Microphone-Condenser-Recording-Podcasting/dp/B01142EPO4/)is an easy-to-setup condenser microphone that you can connect to your computer via USB and start recording in seconds.**

**![tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser](https://images.wondershare.com/tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser.jpg)**

 **Pro:** The value of this microphone is in its ease of use. With a flexible, foldable stand, you can adjust the TONOR PC microphone the way it suits your setup. The legs of the stand are retractable, which makes it easy for you to store. If you are a gamer or creating videos primarily from your desk, this is a perfectly suitable microphone for you to start your YouTube journey with.

**Con:** The audio quality of this mic can help you get the job done, but it wonâ€™t blow you away. The cable is attached to the microphone and is 6.5 feet (2 meters) long, which isnâ€™t a wide range. Itâ€™s pretty much restricted to the desk with your computer. This microphone has limitations, and high-achieving YouTubers will certainly grow out of it.

## **YouTube Microphones for Under $50**

#### **Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99**

**The [Purple Panda](https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R) lavalier microphone comes with multiple adapters and is compatible with nearly all devices, including smartphone, DSLR, computers, and even GoPro cameras. The only device where you will need an[additional adapter](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35mm-headphone-jack-adapter) is if you have an iPhone 7.**

**![purple-panda-lavalier-microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/purple-panda-lavalier-microphone.jpg)**

**Pro:** This microphone is a versatile option for YouTubers who create a variety of content. It doesnâ€™t require any battery and is powered by whatever device it is plugged into, which is great for YouTubers with already so many devices to keep charged.

**Con:** Much like the BOYA BY-M1, the Purple Panda, as it is clipped onto your lapel or shirt collar, will capture the sound of your clothes brushing against it if too much movement occurs.

#### **Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73**

**The [Samson Go](https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Portable-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42) microphone is the kind of mic that can fit in your pocket and be taken with you anywhere.**

![samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone.jpg)

**Pro:** This microphone has both a cardioid and an omnidirectional mode. This means that you can choose to have your microphone focused more on the subject speaking by switching to cardio or switch to Omni-directional to capture audio from the entire surrounding.

It is designed to be able to clip onto a flat surface such as your computer screen. This allows you to place the microphone on different levels to record.

**Con:** Because of its unique design and the portability of the device, it will suffer wear-and-tear faster. Attention to storage is necessary to increase the lifespan of the device.

#### **XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99**

The[XIAOKOA](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Condenser-Microphone-Recording-XIAOKOA/dp/B074GZJ4RP/)portable mini condenser microphone is compatible with smartphones, computers, and any devices using 3.5mm recording jacks.

![xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand](https://images.wondershare.com/xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand.jpg)

**Pro:** With a cardioid pickup, this condenser microphone will do a fine job picking up vocals. If you are a YouTuber who does a lot of singing videos, this is definitely an affordable microphone to check out.

**Con:** This microphone, perhaps primarily designed for karaoke, has an echo feature that, although might create new dimensions to your vocals, may not be desired for your YouTube video. This feature can be problematic, as it could spoil your recording.

#### **TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93**

The [TAKSTAR SGC](https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I)is a condenser microphone, and it can be fixed onto your camera, which simplifies your YouTube setup. This camera can plug directly into your camera, reducing the audio tracks you need to manage when editing.

![takstar-sgc-598](https://images.wondershare.com/takstar-sgc-598.jpg)

**Pro:** The camera-mounted microphone has a shock-resistant design that reduces noise when the camera is moved. The cardioid microphone will be able to pick up audio in the direction it is pointed in, reducing noise capturing from behind the camera. This is a good microphone for vlogging or interviews.

**Con:** The TAKSTAR SGC requires one AA battery, so youâ€™ll have to remember to carry a backup every time you film.

Limited to a vocal subject standing 4-5 feet away, any more and the microphone will be hard-pressed to pick up the audio without capturing a lot of surround audio.

The design requires it to be mounted to the camera. If you want to separate it from the camera and still have it recorded, a bit of creativity is required to keep it standing.

## **YouTube Microphones for Under $100**

####  

#### **Behringer C-1U - $59.99**

The [Behringer C-1U](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-C-1U-BEHRINGER/dp/B001QXCYZY/) is a condenser microphone with a cardioid pickup pattern that connects to your computer via USB.

![behringer-c-1u](https://images.wondershare.com/behringer-c-1u.jpg)

**Pro:** This microphone has a solid metal build and has a good weight. It is quick and easy to set up and is a good microphone for anyone wanting a simple solution for better audio on YouTube.

**Con:** A pop filter is recommended for this microphone as it picks up a lot of popping sounds when the subject speaks.

#### **Blue Microphones Snowball iCE - $64.94**

The [Blue Microphones Snowball iCE](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-Versatile-Microphone/dp/B01L5U4WBQ)is a cardioid condenser microphone that connects to your computer via USB.

![blue-microphones-snowball-ice](https://images.wondershare.com/blue-microphones-snowball-ice.jpg)

**Pro:** The Snowball iCE is a plug-and-play microphone that is super easy to use and doesnâ€™t require any additional battery. Simply connect it to the computer, and you are ready to record your voice. It captures clear and crisp audio for a single voice or single-person recording.

**Con:** The range of this microphone is not that great; youâ€™ll have to be close and be speaking directly into the microphone to get the best audio. It is not ideal for recording moving subjects or those who are further than 2-3 feet away.

#### **Marantz Professional MPM-1000U - $57.06**

The [Marantz Professional MPM-1000U](https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/)is a condenser microphone that records in a cardioid polar pattern that connects to your computer via USB.

![marantz-professional-mpm-1000u](https://images.wondershare.com/marantz-professional-mpm-1000u.jpg)

**Pro**: This budget microphone has excellent all-metal construction. It has a plug-and-play setup and doesnâ€™t require any drivers or installations. It records great instrumentals and would recommend it to those who are recording music for YouTube.

**Con**: May pick up extraneous noises if you are recording vocals while there are movements in your surrounding, but otherwise, this is an excellent microphone in its price range.

## **Final Thoughts**

When looking for microphones under $100, the difference in audio quality is not going to be drastic. What you need to consider is how you are going to be using this piece of equipment.

If your YouTube videos consist of you in a quiet studio environment, I would recommend the [Marantz Professional MPM-1000U](https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/).

However, if you will be recording on the go and require your hands to be free in the scene, I recommend getting a lavalier microphone such as the [Purple Panda](https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R).

But, if you are going to be recording other people, in addition to yourself, Iâ€™d say go with the [TAKSTAR SGC](https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I) as it will give you more audio control in busy environments.

**Con:** The range of this microphone is not that great; youâ€™ll have to be close and be speaking directly into the microphone to get the best audio. It is not ideal for recording moving subjects or those who are further than 2-3 feet away.

#### **Marantz Professional MPM-1000U - $57.06**

The [Marantz Professional MPM-1000U](https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/)is a condenser microphone that records in a cardioid polar pattern that connects to your computer via USB.

![marantz-professional-mpm-1000u](https://images.wondershare.com/marantz-professional-mpm-1000u.jpg)

**Pro**: This budget microphone has excellent all-metal construction. It has a plug-and-play setup and doesnâ€™t require any drivers or installations. It records great instrumentals and would recommend it to those who are recording music for YouTube.

**Con**: May pick up extraneous noises if you are recording vocals while there are movements in your surrounding, but otherwise, this is an excellent microphone in its price range.

## **Final Thoughts**

When looking for microphones under $100, the difference in audio quality is not going to be drastic. What you need to consider is how you are going to be using this piece of equipment.

If your YouTube videos consist of you in a quiet studio environment, I would recommend the [Marantz Professional MPM-1000U](https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/).

However, if you will be recording on the go and require your hands to be free in the scene, I recommend getting a lavalier microphone such as the [Purple Panda](https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R).

But, if you are going to be recording other people, in addition to yourself, Iâ€™d say go with the [TAKSTAR SGC](https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I) as it will give you more audio control in busy environments.

An expensive microphone doesnâ€™t mean it is the best option â€” at least, not for YouTubers. Without professional experience or additional equipment, having a $1000 studio microphone could be wasted money.

If you are on a budget or new to YouTube, and what you want is to improve the audio quality of your video gradually, you should look into the cheaper options first.

In this article, I will highlight microphones in 3 price ranges.

 [Under $20](#twenty)

[Under $50](#fifty)

[Under $100](#hundred)

  We will have a look at each of these microphones, their pros, and cons, and then you can decide which one will be best for your channel and your budget.

As for keeping with your financial needs, we arenâ€™t going to be looking at any XLR microphones, as they will require an audio interface, thus increasing your price range. The microphones in this list will be plug-and-plays, and you will only need the [basic audio recording skills](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get started.

**Disclaimer:** Prices are subjected to change.

## **YouTube Microphones for Under $20**

#### **BOYA BY-M1 - $16.99**

**The[BOYA BY-M1](https://www.amazon.com/BOYA-Microphone-Windscreen-Windshield-Smartphones/dp/B01M2VC8GF/) is a lavalier microphone (a hand-free mic that clips onto your clothing) that connects to smartphones, DSLR, computers, and other audio recorders.**

![boya-by-m1](https://images.wondershare.com/boya-by-m1.jpg)

**Pro**: As an omnidirectional condenser microphone, it will be able to pick up audio from 360 degrees, and with 20 feet (6 meters) of cable, you can have a significant range movement even if you are connected to the camera.

The BOYA BY-M1 is a terrific choice for YouTubers on a budget that is frequently making videos on the go. Itâ€™s easy to carry around, and the ability to simply connect to a smartphone means you can set up and shoot your video on the fly.

**Con**: This mic, although it has a great range, can also pick up subtle movements you make as it is clipped onto you. Not great if there is a lot of action in your videos.

#### **TONOR PC Microphone Computer Condenser - $15.99**

**The [TONOR](https://www.amazon.com/TONOR-Microphone-Condenser-Recording-Podcasting/dp/B01142EPO4/)is an easy-to-setup condenser microphone that you can connect to your computer via USB and start recording in seconds.**

**![tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser](https://images.wondershare.com/tonor-pc-microphone-computer-condenser.jpg)**

 **Pro:** The value of this microphone is in its ease of use. With a flexible, foldable stand, you can adjust the TONOR PC microphone the way it suits your setup. The legs of the stand are retractable, which makes it easy for you to store. If you are a gamer or creating videos primarily from your desk, this is a perfectly suitable microphone for you to start your YouTube journey with.

**Con:** The audio quality of this mic can help you get the job done, but it wonâ€™t blow you away. The cable is attached to the microphone and is 6.5 feet (2 meters) long, which isnâ€™t a wide range. Itâ€™s pretty much restricted to the desk with your computer. This microphone has limitations, and high-achieving YouTubers will certainly grow out of it.

## **YouTube Microphones for Under $50**

#### **Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99**

**The [Purple Panda](https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R) lavalier microphone comes with multiple adapters and is compatible with nearly all devices, including smartphone, DSLR, computers, and even GoPro cameras. The only device where you will need an[additional adapter](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35mm-headphone-jack-adapter) is if you have an iPhone 7.**

**![purple-panda-lavalier-microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/purple-panda-lavalier-microphone.jpg)**

**Pro:** This microphone is a versatile option for YouTubers who create a variety of content. It doesnâ€™t require any battery and is powered by whatever device it is plugged into, which is great for YouTubers with already so many devices to keep charged.

**Con:** Much like the BOYA BY-M1, the Purple Panda, as it is clipped onto your lapel or shirt collar, will capture the sound of your clothes brushing against it if too much movement occurs.

#### **Samson Go Mic Portable USB Condenser Microphone - $37.73**

**The [Samson Go](https://www.amazon.com/Samson-Mic-Portable-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B001R76D42) microphone is the kind of mic that can fit in your pocket and be taken with you anywhere.**

![samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/samson-go-mic-portable-usb-condenser-microphone.jpg)

**Pro:** This microphone has both a cardioid and an omnidirectional mode. This means that you can choose to have your microphone focused more on the subject speaking by switching to cardio or switch to Omni-directional to capture audio from the entire surrounding.

It is designed to be able to clip onto a flat surface such as your computer screen. This allows you to place the microphone on different levels to record.

**Con:** Because of its unique design and the portability of the device, it will suffer wear-and-tear faster. Attention to storage is necessary to increase the lifespan of the device.

#### **XIAOKOA Mini Condenser Microphone with Stand - $24.99**

The[XIAOKOA](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Condenser-Microphone-Recording-XIAOKOA/dp/B074GZJ4RP/)portable mini condenser microphone is compatible with smartphones, computers, and any devices using 3.5mm recording jacks.

![xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand](https://images.wondershare.com/xiaokoa-mini-condenser-microphone-with-stand.jpg)

**Pro:** With a cardioid pickup, this condenser microphone will do a fine job picking up vocals. If you are a YouTuber who does a lot of singing videos, this is definitely an affordable microphone to check out.

**Con:** This microphone, perhaps primarily designed for karaoke, has an echo feature that, although might create new dimensions to your vocals, may not be desired for your YouTube video. This feature can be problematic, as it could spoil your recording.

#### **TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93**

The [TAKSTAR SGC](https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I)is a condenser microphone, and it can be fixed onto your camera, which simplifies your YouTube setup. This camera can plug directly into your camera, reducing the audio tracks you need to manage when editing.

![takstar-sgc-598](https://images.wondershare.com/takstar-sgc-598.jpg)

**Pro:** The camera-mounted microphone has a shock-resistant design that reduces noise when the camera is moved. The cardioid microphone will be able to pick up audio in the direction it is pointed in, reducing noise capturing from behind the camera. This is a good microphone for vlogging or interviews.

**Con:** The TAKSTAR SGC requires one AA battery, so youâ€™ll have to remember to carry a backup every time you film.

Limited to a vocal subject standing 4-5 feet away, any more and the microphone will be hard-pressed to pick up the audio without capturing a lot of surround audio.

The design requires it to be mounted to the camera. If you want to separate it from the camera and still have it recorded, a bit of creativity is required to keep it standing.

## **YouTube Microphones for Under $100**

####  

#### **Behringer C-1U - $59.99**

The [Behringer C-1U](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-C-1U-BEHRINGER/dp/B001QXCYZY/) is a condenser microphone with a cardioid pickup pattern that connects to your computer via USB.

![behringer-c-1u](https://images.wondershare.com/behringer-c-1u.jpg)

**Pro:** This microphone has a solid metal build and has a good weight. It is quick and easy to set up and is a good microphone for anyone wanting a simple solution for better audio on YouTube.

**Con:** A pop filter is recommended for this microphone as it picks up a lot of popping sounds when the subject speaks.

#### **Blue Microphones Snowball iCE - $64.94**

The [Blue Microphones Snowball iCE](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphones-Snowball-Versatile-Microphone/dp/B01L5U4WBQ)is a cardioid condenser microphone that connects to your computer via USB.

![blue-microphones-snowball-ice](https://images.wondershare.com/blue-microphones-snowball-ice.jpg)

**Pro:** The Snowball iCE is a plug-and-play microphone that is super easy to use and doesnâ€™t require any additional battery. Simply connect it to the computer, and you are ready to record your voice. It captures clear and crisp audio for a single voice or single-person recording.

The [Marantz Professional MPM-1000U](https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/)is a condenser microphone that records in a cardioid polar pattern that connects to your computer via USB.

![marantz-professional-mpm-1000u](https://images.wondershare.com/marantz-professional-mpm-1000u.jpg)

**Pro**: This budget microphone has excellent all-metal construction. It has a plug-and-play setup and doesnâ€™t require any drivers or installations. It records great instrumentals and would recommend it to those who are recording music for YouTube.

**Con**: May pick up extraneous noises if you are recording vocals while there are movements in your surrounding, but otherwise, this is an excellent microphone in its price range.

## **Final Thoughts**

When looking for microphones under $100, the difference in audio quality is not going to be drastic. What you need to consider is how you are going to be using this piece of equipment.
