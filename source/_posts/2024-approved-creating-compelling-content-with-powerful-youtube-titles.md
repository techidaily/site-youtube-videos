## Find the Best Keywords

One of the most important steps to ensuring SEO success is to identify the keywords that you should be using.

You can use the [Google keyword planner](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner) to find keywords related to your video’s topic. Input one of your competitors’ video links to detect some of the top searches that were used to find the video. The keyword planner will scan through the top searches for that video link and determine the keywords that are used most often.

The keyword list can be a bit overwhelming the first time. Remember to use keywords that get at least 300 searches per month on Google. Using popular keywords will help you match up against competitors in your niche.

## How to Optimize Your Titles, Descriptions, and Tags

Your keyword research will help you craft title, description, and tags of your videos.

## How to Optimize YouTube Titles

The ideal YouTube title intrigues the potential viewer, drawing them in and making them want to click the link.

A video title should include your most important keyword. Usually, your most important keyword will be the first word in your title. Great titles are accurate and descriptive, but also exciting and captivating.

You should also consider using general keywords that are popular on Google like “funny video” “Tutorial” “Review” and “Fitness”.

## How to Optimize Your Video's Description

The description of your video is the next big important challenge. The text description of your video is how Google and other search engines determine the subject matter of your video for ranking.

Some tips for success with your description include; using 2-3 important keywords in the first 25 words and making each YouTube description more than 250 words.

Your ideal description will help to index your video without over-utilizing keywords and being flagged as spam.

## How to Optimize YouTube Tags

Tags will help decide which videos your video will be displayed beside as similar content and which searches it will appear in.

By using targeted and optimized tags you can gain more traffic and views. Some of the top rules that you should consider with tags are; using 8-12 in every video and making sure the top keyword you used in your title is included as a tag.

Tags on previous videos can also be rearranged and edited as you do keyword research. This will help improve the ranking of some of your older videos. If you all the tags you usually use to a notepad or text edit file and separate them with commas you can paste them all back into YouTube in the new order. This is the simplest way to mass edit tags.

## Just Initial Acquisition

Yes, you are right. Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.

Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.

![youtube platform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg)

Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.

#### In this article

01 [Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos](#Part 1)

02 [YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)

03 [Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads](#Part 3)

04 [Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos

YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:

![youtube aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg)

**Note:** YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar's white or grey/black area along the edges.

## Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos

YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:

![youtube aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg)

**Note:** YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar's white or grey/black area along the edges.

**●** YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop/PC Version:

If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)

**●** YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:

There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.

**●** YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version

Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.

Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:

![vertical video example](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg)

Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.

## Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio

The world is moving swiftly, and with day passing, people want to complete their tasks as quickly as possible. The impact is seen in the field of the YouTube Video making process also with the introduction of YouTube Shorts. After following the short video trends of TikTok, this time YouTube appeared with its new feature YouTube Shorts, which allows a user to create a short video that ranges from 15 to 60 seconds. The only need is for a Smartphone and YouTube Application Shorts camera. And then you are good to go. Note that YouTube Shorts videos get searched and watched by people mainly through their phones.

![youtube shorts ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-shorts-ratio.jpg)

Here also comes the concept of YouTube Shorts Ratio as YouTube Videos primarily follows Vertical format. Following are the requirement for YouTube Shorts Ratio:

**Aspect Ratio:** Vertical format standard ratio is 9:16 (That fill up the entire screen vertically)

**Resolution:** To comply with vertical format, the required resolution is 1920X1080 px.

**Note:** There is also provision for square videos with a 1:1 ratio for YouTube Shorts. But that results in extra white or black padding at the top and bottom areas.

Other possible YouTube Shorts ratios are 4:5, 2:3, 1:2.

## Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads

If you want to monetize from your video or Shorts, use YouTube Ads to generate additional income. Or, if you are already in some business and want to grow your business, do it with YouTube Ads.
