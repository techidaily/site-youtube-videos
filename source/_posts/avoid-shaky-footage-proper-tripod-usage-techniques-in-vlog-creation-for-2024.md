# How To Use a Tripod for Vlogging

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 As you grow into a serious vlogger, a tripod will become an essential piece of equipment. You can get by for a long time setting your camera up on a stack of books, or an upside-down laundry hamper, but not forever. While these setups are great for a beginner, an intermediate vlogger will start to find them limiting. Even if you are an amazingly creative person who can create any camera setup without a tripod there will come a point where you will decide your creative energy is better spent on your video content.

 This article will explain how to use a tripod and then introduce you to four different types.

## Part 1: How To Set a Tripod for Vlogging

#### 1\. Setting Up Your Tripod

**Step 1 –** Pull out all three legs of your tripod and make sure it is standing stably. There will be tensioners on the legs which you can release in order to adjust your height. Once your legs are extended to the height you want continue adjusting them until your tripod is level. Some tripods have a built in bubble level, but if yours does not you can use a separate bubble level or make a guestimate.

 Make sure when you are setting up your tripod that you point one of its legs towards your subject. This will give you room to stand behind your camera, in-between the other two legs. If you have one leg pointed directly behind your camera then you may trip over it. Or, you may knock over and damage your camera.

**Step 2 –** On the top of your tripod there will be a plate with a small hole and a screw. Remove this plate using either a clip or lever, depending on your tripod. Once your plate is detached screw it into the bottom of your camera. It should be tight, but not too tight or you risk damaging your camera.

**Step 3 –** Attach your plate, which now has your camera mounted to it, back onto your tripod.

 Your tripod comes with a ‘head’. Your tripod’s head is what your camera is mounted on top of. There are several different types of tripod heads and mounts which are all useful for different things.

 Ball Heads and Pan/Tilt Heads are the two most common types of tripod heads. Ball Heads allow you to adjust your camera’s position quite a bit before you start shooting. They are not good for adding in camera movements while you are filming, however, because you need to lock them in place. Pan/Tilt heads are great for creating camera movement. Most Pan/Tilt heads have a handle which you can use to make a smooth panning motion.

## Part 2: Why Do You Need a Tripod: Benefits of Using Tripod

 Why can't you just hold a camera in your hand while shooting vlog entries for your YouTube channel? Honestly, you can, but the camera may shake a lot and your footage might end up being unusable. Putting a camera on a tripod reduces the probability of camera shake to the minimum and that is just the tip of the iceberg.

 A huge amount of vlogs can be described as sit down videos, in which the host of the video sits in front of a camera and talks to the audience. Holding a camera while talking or trying to present a product to the viewers is next to impossible, so in order to avoid having to deal with a camera, you can simply put it on a tripod, find the best angle, and push the record button.

 On the go videos, are recorded at exterior locations, and a lot of YouTubers choose to shoot these types of videos handheld, but this approach makes it difficult to maintain the same shot composition for long. A Monopod, Gorillapod or just a simple selfie stick can make your job much easier because they stabilize the camera. In addition, shooting smooth panning shots without a tripod is as difficult as it sounds.

## Part 3: A Few Things You'll Need to Consider Before You Buy a Tripod

 There are thousands of different tripod models you can use for vlogging, but which model you're going to choose depends mostly on the type of vlog you want to make. If you are planning on shooting all of your videos in the studio-like conditions, then portability isn't such an important feature, while quite the opposite is true if you intend on filming all of your footage on outdoor locations.

 However, there are certain traits you have to consider when choosing a tripod you're going to use while recording your vlog entries.

**Sturdiness:** There is absolutely no point in spending money on a tripod that breaks easily. Although if your plan is to shoot vlogs at home or in a studio, then buying a cheaper plastic tripod isn't such a bad option, since the clamps and joints won't have to endure a lot of wear and tear. Consider buying a more durable tripod if you are going to be traveling a lot while working on your vlogs.

**The Type of Camera:** A number of factors can contribute to the weight of a camera, including battery grips or lenses, so before you buy a tripod make sure that it can support the weight of the camera you want to use to record your videos.

**The Maximum Height:** Most vloggers don't really have to worry about how tall their tripod is, because they are not on their feet in any of the shots featured in the video. Vloggers working on DIY videos, cooking tutorials or any other type of vlog that involves movement and action should pay attention to this trait.

**Photo or Video Tripods:** Do you want to take beautiful panning shots? If the answer is yes then you should get a video tripod that enables you to move the camera smoothly in any direction. Photo tripods are a great option for static shots that don't involve a lot of camera movement.

 **Mobility:** The heavier a tripod is, the more stability it can provide, but carrying a tripod that weighs over 10 pounds to shoot sports or adventure vlogs can be a tiring endeavor. Although portability is a factor, it shouldn't prevent you from buying a high-quality tripod that will ensure your footage is perfectly smooth and stable.

## Part 4: 4 Types of Tripods

**Full-Sized Tripods:** are very sturdy, and as a result can be fairly heavy. Although you can take them a lot of places they are not convenient to carry for extended periods of time. They are the most reliable way to ensure you have absolutely no camera shake.

**Compact Tripods:** appear to be the same size as Full-Sized tripods, but they are actually much lighter. You can get the same height with a Compact Tripod as a Full-Sized tripod and it will be much easier to travel with. However, Compact Tripods are not as stable. If you are shooting for an extended period of time you may need to weigh your Compact Tripod down with sandbags to keep it steady.

**Gorillapods:** have flexible legs which can be wrapped around posts, fences, or anything else you may want to mount your camera on. They are also lightweight enough that you can carry them around while you shoot. If you bend it right you can essentially use your Gorillapod as a heavy-duty selfie-stick for your camera.

**Table-Top Tripods:** are very small and easy to travel with. You can leave one in your camera bag or your glove box. Table-Top Tripods are meant to be set up on top of desks or other stable surfaces and may not be ideal for heavier cameras.

## Part 5: The 5 Best Tripods For YouTube Vlogging

 Even if you know everything there is to know about tripods, the selection process can be daunting. That's why we've shortlisted the top 5 tripods on the market, in an effort to make finding the right tripod for your vlog videos as quick an easy as it can possibly be. Let's have a look.

**Step 2 –** On the top of your tripod there will be a plate with a small hole and a screw. Remove this plate using either a clip or lever, depending on your tripod. Once your plate is detached screw it into the bottom of your camera. It should be tight, but not too tight or you risk damaging your camera.

**Step 3 –** Attach your plate, which now has your camera mounted to it, back onto your tripod.

 Your tripod comes with a ‘head’. Your tripod’s head is what your camera is mounted on top of. There are several different types of tripod heads and mounts which are all useful for different things.

 Ball Heads and Pan/Tilt Heads are the two most common types of tripod heads. Ball Heads allow you to adjust your camera’s position quite a bit before you start shooting. They are not good for adding in camera movements while you are filming, however, because you need to lock them in place. Pan/Tilt heads are great for creating camera movement. Most Pan/Tilt heads have a handle which you can use to make a smooth panning motion.

## Part 2: Why Do You Need a Tripod: Benefits of Using Tripod

 Why can't you just hold a camera in your hand while shooting vlog entries for your YouTube channel? Honestly, you can, but the camera may shake a lot and your footage might end up being unusable. Putting a camera on a tripod reduces the probability of camera shake to the minimum and that is just the tip of the iceberg.

 A huge amount of vlogs can be described as sit down videos, in which the host of the video sits in front of a camera and talks to the audience. Holding a camera while talking or trying to present a product to the viewers is next to impossible, so in order to avoid having to deal with a camera, you can simply put it on a tripod, find the best angle, and push the record button.

 On the go videos, are recorded at exterior locations, and a lot of YouTubers choose to shoot these types of videos handheld, but this approach makes it difficult to maintain the same shot composition for long. A Monopod, Gorillapod or just a simple selfie stick can make your job much easier because they stabilize the camera. In addition, shooting smooth panning shots without a tripod is as difficult as it sounds.

## Part 3: A Few Things You'll Need to Consider Before You Buy a Tripod

 There are thousands of different tripod models you can use for vlogging, but which model you're going to choose depends mostly on the type of vlog you want to make. If you are planning on shooting all of your videos in the studio-like conditions, then portability isn't such an important feature, while quite the opposite is true if you intend on filming all of your footage on outdoor locations.

 However, there are certain traits you have to consider when choosing a tripod you're going to use while recording your vlog entries.

**Sturdiness:** There is absolutely no point in spending money on a tripod that breaks easily. Although if your plan is to shoot vlogs at home or in a studio, then buying a cheaper plastic tripod isn't such a bad option, since the clamps and joints won't have to endure a lot of wear and tear. Consider buying a more durable tripod if you are going to be traveling a lot while working on your vlogs.

**The Type of Camera:** A number of factors can contribute to the weight of a camera, including battery grips or lenses, so before you buy a tripod make sure that it can support the weight of the camera you want to use to record your videos.

**The Maximum Height:** Most vloggers don't really have to worry about how tall their tripod is, because they are not on their feet in any of the shots featured in the video. Vloggers working on DIY videos, cooking tutorials or any other type of vlog that involves movement and action should pay attention to this trait.

**Photo or Video Tripods:** Do you want to take beautiful panning shots? If the answer is yes then you should get a video tripod that enables you to move the camera smoothly in any direction. Photo tripods are a great option for static shots that don't involve a lot of camera movement.

 **Mobility:** The heavier a tripod is, the more stability it can provide, but carrying a tripod that weighs over 10 pounds to shoot sports or adventure vlogs can be a tiring endeavor. Although portability is a factor, it shouldn't prevent you from buying a high-quality tripod that will ensure your footage is perfectly smooth and stable.

## Part 4: 4 Types of Tripods

**Full-Sized Tripods:** are very sturdy, and as a result can be fairly heavy. Although you can take them a lot of places they are not convenient to carry for extended periods of time. They are the most reliable way to ensure you have absolutely no camera shake.

**Compact Tripods:** appear to be the same size as Full-Sized tripods, but they are actually much lighter. You can get the same height with a Compact Tripod as a Full-Sized tripod and it will be much easier to travel with. However, Compact Tripods are not as stable. If you are shooting for an extended period of time you may need to weigh your Compact Tripod down with sandbags to keep it steady.

**Gorillapods:** have flexible legs which can be wrapped around posts, fences, or anything else you may want to mount your camera on. They are also lightweight enough that you can carry them around while you shoot. If you bend it right you can essentially use your Gorillapod as a heavy-duty selfie-stick for your camera.

**Table-Top Tripods:** are very small and easy to travel with. You can leave one in your camera bag or your glove box. Table-Top Tripods are meant to be set up on top of desks or other stable surfaces and may not be ideal for heavier cameras.

 As you grow into a serious vlogger, a tripod will become an essential piece of equipment. You can get by for a long time setting your camera up on a stack of books, or an upside-down laundry hamper, but not forever. While these setups are great for a beginner, an intermediate vlogger will start to find them limiting. Even if you are an amazingly creative person who can create any camera setup without a tripod there will come a point where you will decide your creative energy is better spent on your video content.

 This article will explain how to use a tripod and then introduce you to four different types.

## Part 1: How To Set a Tripod for Vlogging

#### 1\. Setting Up Your Tripod

**Step 1 –** Pull out all three legs of your tripod and make sure it is standing stably. There will be tensioners on the legs which you can release in order to adjust your height. Once your legs are extended to the height you want continue adjusting them until your tripod is level. Some tripods have a built in bubble level, but if yours does not you can use a separate bubble level or make a guestimate.

 Make sure when you are setting up your tripod that you point one of its legs towards your subject. This will give you room to stand behind your camera, in-between the other two legs. If you have one leg pointed directly behind your camera then you may trip over it. Or, you may knock over and damage your camera.

**Step 2 –** On the top of your tripod there will be a plate with a small hole and a screw. Remove this plate using either a clip or lever, depending on your tripod.

Ryan Kaji, whose YouTube channel name is Ryan's world, managed to get 30 million subscribers in over five years and is one of the most successful kid YouTubers. Just as he wrote in his bio - Ryan is crazy about doing lots of funny things like pretend play, science experiments, music videos, skits, challenges, DIY arts and crafts, and more!

**Earnings:** $24 million

**Subscribers:** 47.8 million

Despite having 7 million more subscribers than the Ryan's World channel, Donaldson's fortune is currently 5.5 million short of being the largest among YouTubers. As YouTube’s biggest new star, it is still stunning enough for almost 50 million subscribers. As a matter of fact, his ambition is far more than that - 100 million subscribers and 3 billion views during 2021.

His videos combine stunts and humor. In the past half a year, Jimmy experienced prison life, built the largest Lego Tower in the world, sit in a tub of snakes for $10,000, etc. No one would deny all these incredible videos.

And they have built a partnership with Nickelodeon and have a TV show called The Dude Perfect Show.

Most of their YouTube videos are centered around sports activities and they all contain elements of comedy that have significantly contributed to the popularity of the Dude Perfect YouTube channel, and most of their videos are sponsored. The fact that their videos often feature professional athletes and celebrities such as Tyreke Evans, Johnny Manziel, or Tim McGraw also contributed to the swift success of the crew.

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

Yet another gaming video producer made his way to the list of top ten richest YouTube superstars. Mark Fischbach mostly produces LetsPlay videos and is known for his over-the-top commentary style that often involves yelling or cursing.

Mark likes indie and horror video games and for that reason most videos on his Markiplier YouTube channel cover games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Slender: The Eight Pages. In addition to being one of the most popular YouTubers in 2021, Mark is also a voice actor who appeared on several TV shows.

#### 5. [Logan Paul](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8rbF3g2AMX70yOd8vqIZg)

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

The vlogger who caught the public eye with the recent Japanese suicide incident hasn't lost much of his YouTube subscribers despite his controversial behavior. As a matter of fact, his popularity seems to be on the rise at the moment since his videos got over 3 billion views in the three years since he started his YouTube channel. However, this may only be a fluke and his popularity may plummet if he continues to produce shocking but mediocre videos.

His daredevil style has launched this 22-year old to YouTube stardom, but as time passes it will be hard for Logan to maintain this level of success.

#### 6. [Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (YouTube Channel: PewDiePie)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24%5FVd%5FAJ5Yw)

Felix Kjellberg is the owner of the most subscribed channel on YouTube and he is only 28 years old. The Swedish gaming commentator is probably one of the richest Internet celebrities because his net worth is estimated at between $30 and $50 million.

However, he seems to be past his prime, and for the second straight year, Felix's annual income is declining. Aside from the work he's done in the realm of gaming, the world's most popular YouTuber has also published a book that sold more than 112,00 copies and he hosted a web series on YouTube Red titled Scare PewDiePie.

**Earnings:** $11.5 million

Jake Paul is Logan Paul's younger brother, who is an actor, a musician, and a YouTube video producer who first gained recognition on Vine. He's been on YouTube since 2013, and in the subsequent years, videos on his channel collected over 4 billion views.

His song 'It's Everyday Bro' was released on May 30\. 2017 had 70 million views in a single month, but it later went on to become the third most disliked video on YouTube. Jake is only 22 and if he manages to avoid scandals and controversy he may stay among the richest YouTubers for the years to come.

#### 8. [Daniel Middleton (YouTube Channel: DanTDM)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Oz6CHmeoF7vSad0qqXfw)

**Earnings:** $11 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

Who said that gaming is a waste of time? Currently, the richest man on YouTube gaming channel has made his fortune on Minecraft videos, although Daniel Middleton, the owner of the most profitable channel on YouTube has also had quite a bit of success outside of the platform.

Daniel is from the United Kingdom and this British guy who was born in 1991 has published several comic books and starred in a number of TV shows (such as Skylanders Academy) and a YouTube Red Series, but the majority of his income still comes from the views he gets on his Minecraft videos, including gaming sponsorships and merchandise. He even has a second channel called MoreTDM though which was not active in recent years.

#### 9. [Smosh](https://www.youtube.com/user/smosh)

**Earnings:** $11 million

**Subscribers:** 24 million

This is by far the oldest YouTube channel on this list since the duo of slapstick comedians Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla joined the platform back in 2005\. Over the years they have produced some iconic video-game music videos and parodies.

Smosh also has a number of ongoing web series that have attracted nearly 7 billion views and they have won numerous awards. In 2015 Smoosh: The Movie, was released, featuring Hecox and Padilla as themselves, but the film received only mild critical acclaim. Anthony Padilla stopped working on Smosh videos and started his own YouTube channel in 2017.

#### 10. [Lilly Singh (YouTube Channel: IISuperwomanII)](https://www.youtube.com/user/IISuperwomanII)

**Earnings:** $10.5 million

**Subscribers:** 14 million

The Canadian vlogger, comedy video producer, and singer Lilly Singh is the face behind an enormously popular YouTube channel called Superwoman. There is very little doubt that Lilly is indeed a superwoman because in 2021 her estimated earnings will surpass the $10 million mark.

This incredibly talented and beautiful Canadian has been producing YouTube videos since 2010, her videos have collected over 2 billion views. In addition to being a YouTube superstar, Lilly has also made appearances in feature films like Dr. Cabbie, Fahrenheit 451, or Bad Moms., to mention a few. Hopefully, her acting career will be as successful as her YouTube videos.

The world's largest video-sharing platform offers great opportunities for young people who want to share their skills, thoughts, and ideas with the rest of the world, but it also demands a lot of creativity and dedication.

#### 5. [Logan Paul](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8rbF3g2AMX70yOd8vqIZg)

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

The vlogger who caught the public eye with the recent Japanese suicide incident hasn't lost much of his YouTube subscribers despite his controversial behavior. As a matter of fact, his popularity seems to be on the rise at the moment since his videos got over 3 billion views in the three years since he started his YouTube channel. However, this may only be a fluke and his popularity may plummet if he continues to produce shocking but mediocre videos.

His daredevil style has launched this 22-year old to YouTube stardom, but as time passes it will be hard for Logan to maintain this level of success.

#### 6. [Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (YouTube Channel: PewDiePie)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24%5FVd%5FAJ5Yw)

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

**Subscribers:**  96 million

Felix Kjellberg is the owner of the most subscribed channel on YouTube and he is only 28 years old. The Swedish gaming commentator is probably one of the richest Internet celebrities because his net worth is estimated at between $30 and $50 million.

However, he seems to be past his prime, and for the second straight year, Felix's annual income is declining. Aside from the work he's done in the realm of gaming, the world's most popular YouTuber has also published a book that sold more than 112,00 copies and he hosted a web series on YouTube Red titled Scare PewDiePie.

#### 7. [Jake Paul](https://www.youtube.com/user/JakePaulProductions)

**Earnings:** $11.5 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

Jake Paul is Logan Paul's younger brother, who is an actor, a musician, and a YouTube video producer who first gained recognition on Vine. He's been on YouTube since 2013, and in the subsequent years, videos on his channel collected over 4 billion views.

His song 'It's Everyday Bro' was released on May 30\. 2017 had 70 million views in a single month, but it later went on to become the third most disliked video on YouTube. Jake is only 22 and if he manages to avoid scandals and controversy he may stay among the richest YouTubers for the years to come.

#### 8. [Daniel Middleton (YouTube Channel: DanTDM)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Oz6CHmeoF7vSad0qqXfw)

**Earnings:** $11 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

Who said that gaming is a waste of time? Currently, the richest man on YouTube gaming channel has made his fortune on Minecraft videos, although Daniel Middleton, the owner of the most profitable channel on YouTube has also had quite a bit of success outside of the platform.

Daniel is from the United Kingdom and this British guy who was born in 1991 has published several comic books and starred in a number of TV shows (such as Skylanders Academy) and a YouTube Red Series, but the majority of his income still comes from the views he gets on his Minecraft videos, including gaming sponsorships and merchandise. He even has a second channel called MoreTDM though which was not active in recent years.

#### 9. [Smosh](https://www.youtube.com/user/smosh)

**Earnings:** $11 million

**Subscribers:** 24 million

This is by far the oldest YouTube channel on this list since the duo of slapstick comedians Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla joined the platform back in 2005\. Over the years they have produced some iconic video-game music videos and parodies.

Smosh also has a number of ongoing web series that have attracted nearly 7 billion views and they have won numerous awards. In 2015 Smoosh: The Movie, was released, featuring Hecox and Padilla as themselves, but the film received only mild critical acclaim. Anthony Padilla stopped working on Smosh videos and started his own YouTube channel in 2017.

#### 10. [Lilly Singh (YouTube Channel: IISuperwomanII)](https://www.youtube.com/user/IISuperwomanII)

**Earnings:** $10.5 million

**Subscribers:** 14 million

The Canadian vlogger, comedy video producer, and singer Lilly Singh is the face behind an enormously popular YouTube channel called Superwoman. There is very little doubt that Lilly is indeed a superwoman because in 2021 her estimated earnings will surpass the $10 million mark.

This incredibly talented and beautiful Canadian has been producing YouTube videos since 2010, her videos have collected over 2 billion views. In addition to being a YouTube superstar, Lilly has also made appearances in feature films like Dr. Cabbie, Fahrenheit 451, or Bad Moms., to mention a few. Hopefully, her acting career will be as successful as her YouTube videos.

**Earnings:** $29.5 million

**Subscribers:** 41.7 million

Is it unbelievable that the richest YouTubers in 2024 is a nine-year-old boy?

Ryan Kaji, whose YouTube channel name is Ryan's world, managed to get 30 million subscribers in over five years and is one of the most successful kid YouTubers. Just as he wrote in his bio - Ryan is crazy about doing lots of funny things like pretend play, science experiments, music videos, skits, challenges, DIY arts and crafts, and more! Ryan turned his hobbies into creative educational videos, which inspired millions of children.

#### 2. [Mr. Beast (Jimmy Donaldson)](https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000/featured)

**Earnings:** $24 million

**Subscribers:** 47.8 million

Despite having 7 million more subscribers than the Ryan's World channel, Donaldson's fortune is currently 5.5 million short of being the largest among YouTubers. As YouTube’s biggest new star, it is still stunning enough for almost 50 million subscribers. As a matter of fact, his ambition is far more than that - 100 million subscribers and 3 billion views during 2021.

His videos combine stunts and humor. In the past half a year, Jimmy experienced prison life, built the largest Lego Tower in the world, sit in a tub of snakes for $10,000, etc. No one would deny all these incredible videos.

#### 3. [Dude Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/user/corycotton)

**Earnings:** $14 million

**Subscribers:** 43 million

The Dude Perfect group has 5 members, and the Cotton twins Cory and Coby are the core of this team, but their three high school friends have been a part of the project from the beginning. Besides running one of the most subscribed channels on YouTube the Dude Perfect crew also has their own mobile app just named Dude Perfect which is available on iOS and Android. And they have built a partnership with Nickelodeon and have a TV show called The Dude Perfect Show.

Most of their YouTube videos are centered around sports activities and they all contain elements of comedy that have significantly contributed to the popularity of the Dude Perfect YouTube channel, and most of their videos are sponsored. The fact that their videos often feature professional athletes and celebrities such as Tyreke Evans, Johnny Manziel, or Tim McGraw also contributed to the swift success of the crew.

#### 4. [Mark Edward Fischbach (YouTube Channel: Markiplier)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7%5FYxT-KID8kRbqZo7MyscQ)

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

**Subscribers:** 23 million

Yet another gaming video producer made his way to the list of top ten richest YouTube superstars. Mark Fischbach mostly produces LetsPlay videos and is known for his over-the-top commentary style that often involves yelling or cursing.

Mark likes indie and horror video games and for that reason most videos on his Markiplier YouTube channel cover games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Slender: The Eight Pages. In addition to being one of the most popular YouTubers in 2021, Mark is also a voice actor who appeared on several TV shows.
