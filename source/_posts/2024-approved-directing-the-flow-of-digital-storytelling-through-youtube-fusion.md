It requires no additional software, or browser plug-ins (besides Adobe's Flash), which makes it convenient to use. However, it lacks many basic features of modern day consumer video editing software and often crashes while dealing with large video files.

## Part 1\. How to Get Monetized on YouTube: Rules and Requirements

### How to Monetize YouTube Channel

Begin making money from your YouTube videos through the YouTube Partner Program. You can create earnings from your YouTube channel by connecting it to your Google account. Monetize your website using Google AdSense.

Google AdSense generates substantial website revenue. If viewers interact with the ads in your videos, you earn money. Adding AdSense to your YouTube channel makes your videos monetizable.

Some videos cannot be monetized, however. Content must meet specific requirements to qualify for YouTube's program. Criteria include content quality, community guidelines, and copyright compliance. Your YouTube channel can generate income once your videos meet these standards.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Monetizing YouTube Videos: What Are The Requirements?

You can monetize your YouTube videos by joining the YouTube Partner Program. Everyone can create a YouTube account, but YPP requires certain requirements. Every time you create content, you must consider these requirements.

Prior to applying for the program, your channel must first accomplish the following:

* One thousand subscribers
* A total of 4,000 watch hours in the past year

Building your audience and creating great content will help you meet these requirements. Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube's rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.

Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.

When you upload content to YouTube, you'll need to keep these things in mind. Those who plan on monetizing their videos should thoroughly read these documents. You also need to set up a Google AdSense account, which tracks and pays for your YouTube ads.

## Part 1\. How to Get Monetized on YouTube: Rules and Requirements

### How to Monetize YouTube Channel

Begin making money from your YouTube videos through the YouTube Partner Program. You can create earnings from your YouTube channel by connecting it to your Google account. Monetize your website using Google AdSense.

Google AdSense generates substantial website revenue. If viewers interact with the ads in your videos, you earn money. Adding AdSense to your YouTube channel makes your videos monetizable.

Some videos cannot be monetized, however. Content must meet specific requirements to qualify for YouTube's program. Criteria include content quality, community guidelines, and copyright compliance. Your YouTube channel can generate income once your videos meet these standards.

### Monetizing YouTube Videos: What Are The Requirements?

You can monetize your YouTube videos by joining the YouTube Partner Program. Everyone can create a YouTube account, but YPP requires certain requirements. Every time you create content, you must consider these requirements.

Prior to applying for the program, your channel must first accomplish the following:

* One thousand subscribers
* A total of 4,000 watch hours in the past year

Building your audience and creating great content will help you meet these requirements. Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube's rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.

Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.

When you upload content to YouTube, you'll need to keep these things in mind. Those who plan on monetizing their videos should thoroughly read these documents. You also need to set up a Google AdSense account, which tracks and pays for your YouTube ads.
