## Part 2: Editing videos for YouTube on PC \[Detailed Steps\]

Irrespective of the editing software you use, following the steps outlined below will make it is easy for you to edit videos for YouTube on PC. Assuming you already have made your mind on the editing software of choice, use the following steps to edit and export your completed work. To better demonstrate the steps of YouTube video editing, I’ll use Filmra9 video editor to edit YouTube Video.

#### 1.Split or combine your video clips

Most of the editing programs you use will have a timeline view of your work where you can easily cut or drop your shots. Each of the shots taken is actually a separate file which you will have to combine with others to make the video. The split feature in Filmora can cut footage into parts and then you can move it to desired position or just delete the unnecessary part. You can choose any part of the video quickly with the Quick Trim feature in preview. Besides, Filmora supports almost all popular video and photo formats, so there will be no obstacle when you want to combine footage shot with different devices. You can add photos to video or audio to video.

![Filmora9 Split Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-split.jpg)

To combine several footages into one, just place all clips in the video track in order. Form the timeline view, move the shots around, cut, trim or shorten them as you desire. You can also add transitions between shots so that your final production may have a professional look.

#### 2. Crop, Rotate, Pan & Zoom

You can rotate the video at any angle at any direction and change the scale of video footage or other transform. If you want viewers to focus on some part of the frame, you can use try the Pan & Zoom feature.

#### 3.Add texts, Music and other effects

![Filmora9 Add Text & Titles to Video Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-text-filmora9.jpg)

Once the individual shots have been edited into a single video, it is now time for you to add the special effects. This is the time to add stuff such as texts, music and other special effect you may want to see on the video. If you are worried about doing this, just know that you don't have to be a pro editor to do all these since most of the program will guide you through on how to add all the special effects.

#### 4.Save and export

After you have done with adding all the special effects, choose the file format for saving your video then export it. YouTube accepts major file formats and these include MP4, AVI or WMA hence you will be okay when you use any of them.

![Filmora9 Save & Export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-export-options.jpg)

Filmora also allows you to upload videos to YouTube platform directly since it will choose the format and frame rate or codec which suit best.

These are the basic steps you will use when you want to edit YouTube videos on PC. Just remember to use the right widescreen format and also render your files in either 1080i or 720p high definition.

#### 2. Crop, Rotate, Pan & Zoom

You can rotate the video at any angle at any direction and change the scale of video footage or other transform. If you want viewers to focus on some part of the frame, you can use try the Pan & Zoom feature.
