## How to Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro

In this section, we are going to take a quick look at the steps that you need to take in order to properly edit YouTube videos in Final Cut Pro. Without any further ado, let's take a look.

#### Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP

This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you've left it over from some past event that's long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it's a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it's not highlighted or you aren't able to select it, the software doesn't support it, and it's not compatible.

![Import YouTube videos in FCP ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg)

Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.

#### Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro

That's the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.

* First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.

![Synchronize clips in FCP ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg)

* Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on **Balance Color** and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.

![adjust youtube video scale and position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png)

* You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.

#### Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly

![Upload video to YouTube from FCP](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg)

This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -> Share -> Master File -> Setting -> File -> Share -> YouTube. That's basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -> Publish and the entire thing is done. That's all you need to do in order to quickly and conveniently upload your video to YouTube directly from the FCP.

Few social media mediums have grown more vital than YouTube. In certain instances, a good YouTube presence could make or break a business or budding entertainment sensation.

Those with high YouTube rankings typically yield more returns from the said venue. Luckily, users might increase these vital statistics by paying close attention to several factors that affect YouTube video ranking.

#### In this article

[Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking](#part1)

[Top 8 YouTube Rank Tracker](#part2)

## Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking

If you are a YouTuber, you have to understand how videos rank higher. In turn, this will allow you to ensure your content appears in top search results more often. With that in mind, here are some factors that affect your YouTube ranking.

#### Video Title

![factors that affect youtube video ranking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-1.png)

YouTube videos number in the many millions. Therefore, users enjoy a significant deal of variety when choosing which ones to view. YouTubers may yield a more favorable ranking by creating a catchy title.

On-page YouTube ranking optimization is crucial if you want to get a higher video ranking. Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.

A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views. Experts recommend using short titles that immediately get to the meat and potatoes of what the video entails. Avoid long titles as some devices, browsers, and search engines can cut them off.

Video titles should have five words or less. Don't forget to place keywords at the beginning of the title. The keywords should also be relevant to your video.

#### Video Description

![factors that affect youtube video ranking - video description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-2.png)

When many videos on the same or similar topics exist, content can seem repetitive to prospective viewers. Therefore, YouTubers should offer a short but detailed description of the information contained within. And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.

Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won't know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.

Make sure your video description is 250 words or more. Additionally, include relevant and suitable keywords.

When writing the description, you can place the main keyword in your first 25 words and then link to external URLs; for instance, you could link to related blog content or your social media channels.

#### Video Quality

Poor quality is an immediate buzz kill. Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.

Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.

What's more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.

Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.

YouTube's algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly

Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.

Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.

YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.

Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.

#### Number of Views

![factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png)

Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.

If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.

You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.

#### Closed Captions and Subtitles

![factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png)

Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.

While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.

## How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking

#### Focusing on User Engagement

One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.

#### Using Video Hashtags

Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.

Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.

#### Categorizing Your Video

After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.

## Factors that Affect YouTube Video Ranking

If you are a YouTuber, you have to understand how videos rank higher. In turn, this will allow you to ensure your content appears in top search results more often. With that in mind, here are some factors that affect your YouTube ranking.

#### Video Title

![factors that affect youtube video ranking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-1.png)

YouTube videos number in the many millions. Therefore, users enjoy a significant deal of variety when choosing which ones to view. YouTubers may yield a more favorable ranking by creating a catchy title.

On-page YouTube ranking optimization is crucial if you want to get a higher video ranking. Metadata is one of the YouTube ranking factors; this includes your video title. Essentially, titles give the first impression of any video to end users, YouTube, and search engines.

A well-titled video attracts more traffic, which translates to more views. Experts recommend using short titles that immediately get to the meat and potatoes of what the video entails. Avoid long titles as some devices, browsers, and search engines can cut them off.

Video titles should have five words or less. Don't forget to place keywords at the beginning of the title. The keywords should also be relevant to your video.

#### Video Description

![factors that affect youtube video ranking - video description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-2.png)

When many videos on the same or similar topics exist, content can seem repetitive to prospective viewers. Therefore, YouTubers should offer a short but detailed description of the information contained within. And above all, address how their video stands out from similar content.

Because Google and YouTube cannot extract information from videos, they use text descriptions to define the content on videos. Therefore, if you do not include a description, search engines won't know what your video is about: this might affect your ranking.

Make sure your video description is 250 words or more. Additionally, include relevant and suitable keywords.

When writing the description, you can place the main keyword in your first 25 words and then link to external URLs; for instance, you could link to related blog content or your social media channels.

#### Video Quality

Poor quality is an immediate buzz kill. Few people can bear to watch a video with poor sound or picture quality. In many instances, quality is one of the YouTube ranking factors. HD (high-definition) videos rank higher than lower-quality ones. YouTube often highlights HD videos in its top search results.

Filmora can help you improve the quality of your videos, which will make them rank higher. The software allows you to edit your video and change its hue, brightness, saturation, and contrast. You can also crop, cut, and trim your videos.

What's more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.

What's more? Filmora allows you to adjust output volume, pitch, fade-in, and fade-out to make your video clear. Once you have finished creating your HD video, you can head to the Export tab and select Upload to YouTube to publish your video on your channel.

![factors that affect youtube video ranking - watch time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-4.png)

Watch Time is also among the YouTube ranking factors. According to YouTube, Watch Time is the total length of time people spend watching your videos.

YouTube's algorithm prioritizes videos leading to longer viewing sessions over the ones with more views. You can use Audience Retention Report and YouTube Analytics Views Report to find out which videos have the worst and best view times. Doing this will allow you to plan for your future content accordingly

Using annotations and leaving links to other videos in your description box can help you increase the length of your viewing sessions.

#### Thumbnails

![factors that affect youtube video ranking -Thumbnails](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-5.png)

Thumbnails have a positive effect on click-through rates when used the right way. You can use them to maximize your views and YouTube video ranking.

YouTube generates thumbnails by taking screenshots from videos. However, you might want to go for customized thumbnails, as this will allow you to stand out from your competitors and outperform their videos.

Make sure the image you use as your thumbnail is aesthetically pleasing and grabs the attention of viewers. Also, it should be relevant to the content in your video. Keep in mind that thumbnails with a 16:9 aspect ratio and a 1280-by-20-pixel resolution generally perform best.

#### Number of Views

![factors that affect youtube video ranking -Number of Views](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-6.png)

Views are a vital YouTube ranking factor, as people are more likely to watch videos with a high number of views. The more views your video has, the higher it will rank, especially for competitive keywords.

If you want to rank high for competitive keywords, ensure that your videos get loads of views. For this reason, you have to take steps and get your video content on other platforms. In turn, you will increase the visibility of your videos and view count.

You could embed your videos into your blog posts or share them on social media platforms to get more people to watch them.

#### Closed Captions and Subtitles

![factors that affect youtube video ranking -Closed Captions and Subtitles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-video-ranking-7.png)

Adding captions to videos with spoken-word content can improve your YouTube video ranking. Essentially, it opens up your videos to a larger audience, including people who are deaf and anyone speaking a different language from the one in your videos. Search engines also crawl close captions, which can boost your rankings.

While YouTube offers automatic captioning, it is not perfect. So you may need to make some edits or upload the captions yourself.

## How to Optimize Your YouTube Ranking

#### Focusing on User Engagement

One of the best YouTube ranking optimization practices that you can implement is asking users to leave comments, like your videos, and share them. YouTube analyzes these metrics to determine the quality of your content. Ergo, if YouTube sees your video is engaging users, it will rank higher than those with little or no engagement.

#### Using Video Hashtags

Hashtags help people to find content that provides answers to their questions across various platforms. Use related hashtags when creating your descriptions to ensure people find your videos when searching for specific hashtags.

Tags help drive search because they make main trends more visible. After adding a hashtag to the description, it will appear above the video title, and viewers will see it hyperlinked.

#### Categorizing Your Video

After uploading your video, you should categorize it by going to Advanced settings. By choosing a category, YouTube will group your videos with similar content. Viewers will find your quickly, as they will come in the right audience searches. In turn, this will help your videos to rank higher.

## Conclusion
