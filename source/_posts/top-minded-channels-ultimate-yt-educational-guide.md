There are several ways to do that. The legal and recommended method is to get a YouTube Music Premium subscription. This will enable you to download songs from YouTube and save them on your iPhone for offline consumption. The alternative way involves numerous websites and apps that enable you to convert YouTube videos to mp3 and download them on your iPhone. This approach, however, is illegal and should be avoided.

### Final Verdict

After going through the list of YouTube music converters in this article, we have found that Filmora is the ultimate solution for all your video download and audio conversion needs. With its matchless features, this App makes your life simple and melodious. However, it is our suggestion, the final call will be yours. We would like to know which was your choice and how was the experience using it. Thanks, readers for having a glance at this post. We hope you are delighted after reading it and finding what you needed.
