* **Copyright Guidelines:** Content must not infringe on the copyright of others, including music or videos without permission.

This implies that more creators can monetize their channels. By attaining YouTube monetization eligibility quickly, small YouTubers will now be motivated to create content with more value.

### **Who Benefits the Most from YouTube Monetization Rules 2023**

Ad revenue is the most sustainable form of monetization. Creators donâ€™t have to ask the community to support them financially. They only create good quality content and build a large following. The new YouTube policies for monetization will mostly benefit creators who create Shorts or stream on YouTube.

![shorts revenue sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-4.JPG)

Streamers usually have a higher watch time than the number of subscribers they have. So, the new policy will allow YouTubers will a low following to earn from streaming their content. Short creators will benefit from the high number of views shorts tend to generate.

### **New Policies Make YouTube More Competitive**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will not only benefit creators. By making it easier for creators to earn on the platform, YouTube is becoming more competitive amongst other platforms. These policies will make YouTube dominate the traditional long-form videos, as well as the emerging shirt-form content. More creators find the new policies more friendly and are more willing to put their content on the platform.

### **Advertisers to Benefit**

The new YouTube channel monetization rules will be great for advertisers. They will no longer have to worry about their ads showing up on videos that are inappropriate or fly-by-night. The quality of channels where the ads show will be much better. This means that advertiser will have their ads placed on channels of nano- and micro-influencers. These are more likely to have a loyal following and are more likely to act on the adverts.

### **Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels**

The new policies make it easier for more creators to monetize their channels. Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.

Itâ€™s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators.
