## 1\. Have a Consistent Layout

Your thumbnails all must look like part of the same set. You want viewers to recognize your videos like yours, and they are more likely to do that if you build up a standard layout that they can start associating with you.

An example of a standard layout could be you in the middle of the screen wearing an expression that matches the theme of your video, with your title written underneath your face. Every individual thumbnail would still be different, but you and the text would always be in the same spot.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **2\. Use Your Face**

People feel automatically connected and drawn into images that make eye contact. This makes thumbnails which feature faces more click-able than thumbnails which don’t, in most genres (i.e. if you make food videos then this may not apply – featuring the food might be more important than featuring your face). [Check out more tips like this here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Also, if somebody recognizes you in your thumbnail from a previous video of yours, that will go a long way towards making them click.

## 3\. Use Graphics/Emojis that are On Topic

Anybody can take a screenshot of themselves in their video and use it as a thumbnail. To make your thumbnails look polished, consider using small images (like emojis or hearts) to stand out. This will add color and personality to your thumbnail.

Make sure the images you choose are relevant to the topic of your video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Make Your Text Huge

If you use text in your thumbnail (you don’t have to) then it should be to add context. For example, if the main image is just you smiling then you might need some text to let viewers know the video is a makeup tutorial.

Thumbnails might look large while you’re putting them together in your image editor, but when they’re displayed on YouTube they’re a lot smaller. That goes double if a viewer is watching on their phone. So, make sure that any text you use is large enough that it can be read easily on small screens.

## 5\. Keep it Clutter-Free

It’s great to add text and emojis to your thumbnails, but you do need to be careful not to add too much. You never want your thumbnails to look cluttered. Viewers should be able to glance at your thumbnails and know exactly what kind of video to expect – that’s difficult to do if there’s too much to process.

A good rule for text is to use only 1-3 words. That way they won’t clutter your screen, and you can make them large enough to read on small-screened devices.

Titles and thumbnails sometimes aren't enough. Viewers need to know more about the video before they watch it. What do they do to get that information? They look at the video description.

Description templates will let you write descriptions very easily. All you have to do is replace the words to fit your video, and you are done! Learn more about them below.

### YouTube Channel Description

![example of a channel description](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-description-templates-description-sample.JPG)

This is the text on your About page. It explains to your visitors what your channel is all about. What can they expect from you? You should put this information in your channel description. It's how you can get discovered by people looking for content exactly like what you offer. Basically, your channel description is like an ad. It tells other users why they should subscribe to your channel.

## Tips for Creating an Amazing YouTube Description

YouTube is not only telling people that they should watch your content. It also tells YouTube to recommend the video to users searching for something to watch. YouTube crawls the description to rank your videos in search results. That said, you must do it right. Here are some tips you should keep in mind.

1. Include the most important keywords in your video description.
2. Inform viewers what to expect from the video. What is it about? Is it a travel blog, food review, or what?
3. Add relevant hashtags to your video description.
4. Add links (relevant resources, your socials, timestamps, links to your other videos, etc.)
5. Ensure the hook is attention-grabbing. Otherwise, people would ignore it and your video altogether.
6. Add a call-to-action to remind your viewers to like and subscribe.
7. Note that only the first 200 characters will appear on the screen. Users need to click the "Show More" button to view the rest. So put what's most important in the first 200 characters.

### Benefits of Using a YouTube Description Templates

If you have a business or something on the internet that needs promotion, you think of SEO (Search Engine Optimization.) It makes the material appear more often and higher on searches.

When thinking about SEO, people think of Google. And rightly so. It is the largest search engine in the world. But SEO is also important on YouTube - the world's second-largest search engine. The thing is that SEO for videos on YouTube is different from SEO for Google or other engines.

YouTube descriptions play a huge part in SEO. And description templates make writing appealing descriptions easier for content creators like you.

Please note that this is not the whole description. Rather, it is only the first 200 characters of it. As you can see, it's a CTA. It's wise to put it there because that part is what people would see the most. They'd have to click the "See More" button to read the rest of the description. And not everyone will click that.

**Tip:** Use URL shorteners if your website URL is too long. Remember that you only have 200 characters to use. So every character you can remove counts.
