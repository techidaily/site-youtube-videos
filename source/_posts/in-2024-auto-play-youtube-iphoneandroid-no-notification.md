When it comes to music, the majority of song lovers now prefer listening to it on their iPhone or Android phones, and most of them are still searching for a method to **play YouTube in the background** so they can enjoy their favorite tracks without much battery consumption.

Another reason why people may want to listen to YouTube in the background could be that they want to use their phone for other purposes such as for text messaging, Internet browsing, accessing Facebook, etc. on the device simultaneously.

With that said, here you will learn how to **play YouTube in the background on iPhone** **or Android** both with and without any specific app.

## Best Paid Solution for Playing YouTube in Background: YouTube Premium

YouTube Premium, formerly YouTube Red, is a paid subscription with three types of plans namely ‘Individual’, ‘Family’, and ‘Student’ offered by the streaming giant for $11.99, $17.99, and $6.99 per month respectively. All the plans give you ad-free and uninterrupted streaming experience.

Note: The price of the plans may vary depending on the region of your residence and Google policies. Nevertheless, no annual subscription is available at the time of this writing, and the amount is deducted from your account on monthly basis.

While each plan has its own merits and demerits, the most used one is Individual that also gives free access to YouTube Music, an app that is available for Android and iOS devices, and is specifically dedicated to the music where you can watch and listen to your favorite tracks published on the platform.

What makes YouTube Music popular among the premium subscribers is its ability to play the music even when the app is not active and/or when the phone screen is turned off. Furthermore, you can even configure the app to play the audio without video, thus significantly reducing the battery consumption.

**Note:** Unlike the YouTube main app itself, YouTube Music is limited only to the music, and cannot play other videos.

Once you have subscribed for the YouTube Premium Individual plan, and downloaded and installed the YouTube Music app, you can follow the instructions given below to **play YouTube in background Android or iPhone** smartphone.

### Step 1: Launch YouTube Music and Start Streaming

Launch **YouTube Music**, search for your favorite music using the **Search** icon at the top-right corner, tap the song in the suggestions list, and then tap the name of the track to start playing.

## 3 Best Apps to Play YouTube Videos in Background on Android

Instead of using the above workaround on Android, if you want something simpler and more straightforward, there are a few apps that can help you **play YouTube videos in background**. Some of the most used programs are listed below:

### [VLC for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc&hl=en%5Fus)

### [Background player for YouTube Vanced minimizer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.free.music.app&hl=en%5Fus)

Yet another app available on Google Play Store that lets you search for your favorite videos on YouTube, stream them, and then minimize the player to a floating window that goes down to the bottom of the screen.

**Conclusion**

Watching YouTube videos has become a part of people’s day-to-day life now.

For the latter scenario, the processes explained above are likely to come in handy in order to **play YouTube in background** so the users can take full advantage of their iPhone or Android smartphone in case they only want to listen to the audio, and are not interested in watching the video while streaming.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

When it comes to music, the majority of song lovers now prefer listening to it on their iPhone or Android phones, and most of them are still searching for a method to **play YouTube in the background** so they can enjoy their favorite tracks without much battery consumption.

Another reason why people may want to listen to YouTube in the background could be that they want to use their phone for other purposes such as for text messaging, Internet browsing, accessing Facebook, etc. on the device simultaneously.

With that said, here you will learn how to **play YouTube in the background on iPhone** **or Android** both with and without any specific app.

## Best Paid Solution for Playing YouTube in Background: YouTube Premium

YouTube Premium, formerly YouTube Red, is a paid subscription with three types of plans namely ‘Individual’, ‘Family’, and ‘Student’ offered by the streaming giant for $11.99, $17.99, and $6.99 per month respectively. All the plans give you ad-free and uninterrupted streaming experience.

Note: The price of the plans may vary depending on the region of your residence and Google policies. Nevertheless, no annual subscription is available at the time of this writing, and the amount is deducted from your account on monthly basis.

While each plan has its own merits and demerits, the most used one is Individual that also gives free access to YouTube Music, an app that is available for Android and iOS devices, and is specifically dedicated to the music where you can watch and listen to your favorite tracks published on the platform.

What makes YouTube Music popular among the premium subscribers is its ability to play the music even when the app is not active and/or when the phone screen is turned off. Furthermore, you can even configure the app to play the audio without video, thus significantly reducing the battery consumption.

**Note:** Unlike the YouTube main app itself, YouTube Music is limited only to the music, and cannot play other videos.

Once you have subscribed for the YouTube Premium Individual plan, and downloaded and installed the YouTube Music app, you can follow the instructions given below to **play YouTube in background Android or iPhone** smartphone.

### Step 1: Launch YouTube Music and Start Streaming

Launch **YouTube Music**, search for your favorite music using the **Search** icon at the top-right corner, tap the song in the suggestions list, and then tap the name of the track to start playing.

### Step 2: Switch to Audio Only (Optional)

### Step 3: Play YouTube in Background

Use your phone-specific button or option to minimize YouTube Music. You can then either continue using your smartphone normally, or turn off the screen to **play YouTube in background**.

## How to Play YouTube Videos in Background on iPhone

If you don’t want to pay for YouTube Premium, there are a few other workarounds that you can try to play YouTube in background on your iPhone. One of the easiest methods among them is explained below:

### Step 1: Play YouTube Video on Browser

Launch Safari on your iPhone, and go to [**www.youtube.com**](https://www.youtube.com) (important). Make sure to type the URL in the address bar so the YouTube app doesn’t start, and you can access YouTube from within the browser window itself.

Use the regular method to search for the video you want to play in the background, and tap the **Play** button to start streaming.

### Step 2: Open a New Tab

Tap the **All Tabs** icon from the bottom-right corner of the browser, and tap **+** from the bottom-center. Notice how the YouTube video continues to play even when you are on the new tab.

### Step 3: Play YouTube in Background

Press the **Home** button or swipe up on iPhone X or above to get to the Home screen. You can notice how YouTube still continues to stream. From this point onward, you can either start using your iPhone normally, or turn off the screen and let your device **play YouTube in background**.

## How to Play YouTube Videos in Background on Android

The process to **play YouTube in background** on an Android smartphone is slightly different than what it is on an iPhone if you don’t have a Premium subscription. To get this done on your Android, you must:

### Step 1: Switch to Desktop Mode

Launch Google Chrome (default) on your Android phone, and go to [**www.youtube.com**](https://www.youtube.com). Click the **More options** icon (with three vertically aligned dots) from the top-right corner of the browser, and check the **Desktop site** box from the menu that appears.

## 3 Best Apps to Play YouTube Videos in Background on Android

### [VLC for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc&hl=en%5Fus)

### [Minimize play in background](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kostenlose.musik.app&hl=en%5FUS)

### [Background player for YouTube Vanced minimizer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.free.music.app&hl=en%5Fus)

Yet another app available on Google Play Store that lets you search for your favorite videos on YouTube, stream them, and then minimize the player to a floating window that goes down to the bottom of the screen. This lets you **play YouTube in background** in order to allow you to use your phone for other tasks.

## Propel Your YouTube Journey: Breakthroughs at the 500-Subscriber Mark

For small creators on YouTube, getting monetized seemed like an uphill task. You had to accumulate over 1,000 subscribers and over 4,000 public watch hours. This can be difficult to attain, especially on a platform where creators are publishing new content every day. However, the 2023 update on the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) provided an easier way to start making money on YouTube. In this article, we look at how the YPP is changing and the beauty of the YouTube monetization 500 subscribers’ policy update.

**YouTube Shorts Monetization** A cross-platform for helping you present your content in the best way possible!

## **Part 1.** **YouTube Monetization Revamp: 500 Subscribers Minimum Threshold Unveiled**

The recent update in YouTube monetization requirements has made it easier than ever for small creators to make money on the platform. The YPP program changed and reduced the number of subscribers needed to be eligible. It has also reduced the amount of watch time needed. Let’s have a look at what the new eligibility criteria look like:

![new eligibility criteria](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/unlock-youtube-monetization-with-500-subscribers-1.JPG)

The eligibility criteria for the YPP program are now easier and more achievable than before. To apply, you now need:

* At least 500 subscribers
* Three Shorts or Video uploads in the last 90 days
* At least 3,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or
* At least 3 million public Short videos in the last 90 days

The new requirements are lower than the old ones. Previously, you were required to have at least 1,000 subscribers with over 4,000 public watch hours. By lowering the threshold, YouTube makes it easier for all creators to monetize their content.

## **Part 2\. YouTube Monetization with 500 Subscribers: A Brief Guide**

YouTube announced in 2022 that they were evolving the YPP to continue rewarding more creators. Starting mid-June 2023, the program was expanded to allow more creators to access monetization benefits.
