<h2 id="Finding-Your-Niche-in-Beauty-or-Lifestyle"><a href="#Finding-Your-Niche-in-Beauty-or-Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="Finding Your Niche in Beauty or Lifestyle"></a><strong>Finding Your Niche in Beauty or Lifestyle</strong></h2><p>As a new makeup, beauty, or lifestyle YouTuber you’ll be jumping into a category that’s already packed with thousands of channels. In order to gain any momentum, you’ll have to decide on a particular thing you want to be known for. That’s your niche.</p>
<p>People looking for beauty tutorials are often looking for someone who has something in particular in common with them. Hairstyling for a specific ethnicity, for example, is a potential niche because people want to learn how to style their own hair, not a hair in general.</p>
<p>Another way you could find a niche is by taking on a specific area of interest, like a skincare channel with a focus on coping with acne or a makeup channel with a focus on natural products.</p>
<p>  SunKissAlba has a lifestyle channel that focuses on a ‘natural’ niche. She posts videos about every aspect of her lifestyle from putting on makeup to cooking, but natural&#x2F;non-toxic products are a constant theme through everything she does. By niching her channel she hasn’t limited what kinds of videos she can do at all - she posts a huge variety of different types of videos. What she has done is to make her channel particularly valuable to audiences interested in things that are natural or organic.</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy"><a href="#Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy"></a><strong>Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy</strong></h2><p>It’s a lot easier to come up with weekly video ideas when you have an overarching strategy.</p>
<p>The easiest way to figure out what kinds of videos you should make (and this can also help determine your niche!) is to think about what you already do and enjoy. If skincare is particularly important to you, for example, then you could build a content strategy that includes things like your favorite sunscreen, what different ingredients in skincare products are for, or even how to make a DIY face mask.</p>
<p>The same thing goes if you love doing big glamourous makeups for going out. Think about what you like, and that will determine what you should talk about in your videos.</p>
<p>Instead of buying new products to use in videos, try to use and showcase what you already have.</p>
<p>Here are some common types of beauty and lifestyle videos:</p>
<p><strong><em>Get Ready With Me:</em></strong> a video where you put your makeup on which helps your audience get to know you better.</p>
<p><strong><em>Monthly Favorites:</em></strong> showcases your favorite products from the last month.</p>
<p><strong><em>Makeup Collection:</em></strong> viewers will want to see what you have.</p>
<p><strong><em>DIY:</em></strong> create something, like a homemade moisturizer, and show your viewers how to make their own.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Makeup Hauls:</em></strong> show off what you’ve bought recently.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lookbooks:</em></strong> put together a few looks based on a theme, like a specific color or event.</p>
<p><strong><em>First Impressions:</em></strong> show yourself using a new product for the first time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Makeup Tutorials:</em></strong> teach your viewers how to achieve a particular look, like a smokey eye.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s In My Bag</em></strong>: empty your handbag to show viewers what you carry around with you, particularly your most essential makeup.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Routine:</em></strong> show viewers your morning skincare routine, or how you usually take your makeup off before bed. Any of your beauty-related routines will be interesting to your followers.</p>
<p> You should also be ready to jump on trends as they jump up. You can get a bump in viewership from people searching for a particular trend. Here are a couple of examples of past trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boyfriend Does My Makeup</li>
<li>Kid’s Makeup Challenge</li>
<li>No Mirror Makeup Challenge</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-to-Get-Products-to-Review"><a href="#How-to-Get-Products-to-Review" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Products to Review"></a><strong>How to Get Products to Review</strong></h2><p> You probably already know that a lot of the products popular beauty YouTubers review in their videos were sent to them for free. Brands want to get their products into the hands of creators who have ‘influence’ both in the hopes that their audiences will decide to buy them and as part of generating buzz – getting more people talking about their products so more people become interested.</p>
<p>In order for a brand to consider sending you a free product to review or feature in a video, you will first have to have a large enough following.</p>
<p>What is ‘large enough’? There’s no magic number of YouTube subscribers or Instagram followers. How large your following needs to be will depend on what brands you want to work with, as well as whether your channel has a specific niche.</p>
<p>Large brands will want to work with larger creators. Smaller brands that are still trying to build notoriety may be more open to working with creators whose followings are not as large.</p>
<p>If you have a very specific niche then that could create more opportunities for you as a mid-sized YouTuber. If you specialize in styling curly black hair, and a brand is marketing a product made specifically for styling curly black hair, then your smaller following will be more valuable to that brand than the larger audience of a more general channel.</p>
<p>Here are 4 tips for getting free products for review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow your favorite brands on Instagram and subscribe to their YouTube channels. Make sure to take them when you feature their products in your posts or videos.</li>
<li>Focus on growing your community&#x2F;audience. As you start getting more subscribers and building up momentum for your channel, brands might start reaching out to you. We’ve got some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/27-fun-and-easy-tactics-to-get-more-youtube-subscribers-405.html" >tips on growing your YouTube channel here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Make a pitch to a brand. The first step in this is figuring out who to pitch to. You can send smaller brands DMs via Instagram or Twitter and politely ask for contact info for a PR person. Never ask for free product or sponsorship at this point, just information you can use to contact PR.</li>
<li>Send an email with your pitch to the brand’s PR person. Your email should introduce yourself, describe your content, and talk about what type of audience you have (how many subscribers, where are they located, how old are they, etc. This information is all available in your Creator Studio analytics).<br>Make sure to link to your channel so they can verify what you say (do not hide your subscriber count).<br>Emphasize what value you could provide the brand with (i.e. ‘I’ve had a lot of success with videos on managing acne and I’m sure my subscribers would love to see a review of your cream’) and outline what kind of video you’d like to make (i.e. a five-minute review focusing on the product, or a short feature in a longer makeup tutorial).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Simple-Camera-Setup-for-Beauty-Vloggers"><a href="#Simple-Camera-Setup-for-Beauty-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="Simple Camera Setup for Beauty Vloggers"></a><strong>Simple Camera Setup for Beauty Vloggers</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of different ways to set up your camera for a ‘talking head’ video (anything that is primarily you talking to the camera). Keep reading to learn about a popular ring-light setup for beauty videos, or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-ways-to-set-up-your-talking-head-shots-for-youtube-431.html" >click here to learn 4 different camera setups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, this is what you’ll build your setup out of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Camera with a flip-out screen</li>
<li><a href="#ringlights">Ring light</a></li>
<li>Camera-mounted shotgun mic</li>
<li>Tripod (unless you can mount your camera inside your ring light)</li>
</ol>
<p> If you don’t have access to all of the equipment above, try some of these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Smartphone camera</li>
<li><a href="#diy">DIY ring light</a></li>
<li>Smartphone shotgun mic or LAV</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Set your camera and ring light (your camera should be sitting directly behind your ring light, or mounted inside of it) up about 3 feet away from your subject (yourself).</p>
<p>You might want to experiment with sitting at different distances to see how the lighting looks on your face.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Set your camera up a bit higher than your face and tilt it down towards yourself (shooting from slightly above is always more flattering). It should be set up at about a 15° angle to you.</p>

                      alt="tilt down your camera"
                ></p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> Check your frame (this is easiest if your camera has a screen that flips out) to make sure there’s not too much empty space in your shot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong> Adjust your camera’s focus so your picture is clear. You may need to set up a lamp, chair, or stuffed animal as a stand-in for yourself while you stand behind the camera adjusting the focus.</p>
<p>Turn off autofocus and adjust your focus manually by turning the focus ring on your lens, if you’re using a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong> Set your f-stop (aperture) so that your depth of field is deep enough for you to lean forwards or backward without becoming blurry.</p>
<p>An aperture of f&#x2F;5.0 is good if you’re going to be moving around a lot, but if you’re not going to be moving much and want a blurry background you might want to go with f&#x2F;2.8 or lower.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Set your ISO (film speed). A lower ISO will give you a darker, but higher quality, image. A higher ISO will lower your quality and give you a brighter image.</p>
<p>ISO 400 should be a happy medium for shooting inside with your ring light, but you may need to try out a couple of settings to find one perfect for your situation.</p>

<h2 id="Lighting-for-Beauty"><a href="#Lighting-for-Beauty" class="headerlink" title="Lighting for Beauty"></a><strong>Lighting for Beauty</strong></h2><p>The key to achieving a high-quality picture for your beauty video is having a lot of light.</p>
<p>A ring light (whether it’s <a href="#ringlights">one you purchase</a> or <a href="#diy">one you make</a>) will give you even light over your whole face, and that may be enough. Ring lights are considered one of the biggest ‘secrets’ to beauty on YouTube (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.racked.com/2016/6/2/11828904/beauty-vlogger-youtube-ring-lights" >as explained in this Racked article <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p>
<p>There are, however, some reasons you might want additional light:</p>
<h4 id="To-Light-your-Background-Space"><a href="#To-Light-your-Background-Space" class="headerlink" title="To Light your Background&#x2F;Space"></a><strong>To Light your Background&#x2F;Space</strong></h4><p>If you only have a ring light&#x2F;front light then you may end up looking like you’re surrounded by shadows. If you want more light for your space you can use windows, household lamps, or professional video lights like softboxes or LED panels.</p>

<p>Setting up a light to shine up at you from behind will help you pop out from your background by creating a silhouette.</p>
<p>You can use an LED panel or a household lamp as a backlight.</p>
<h4 id="To-Add-Dimension-to-Your-Face-Side-Lights-Fill-Lights"><a href="#To-Add-Dimension-to-Your-Face-Side-Lights-Fill-Lights" class="headerlink" title="To Add Dimension to Your Face (Side Lights&#x2F; Fill Lights)"></a><strong>To Add Dimension to Your Face (Side Lights&#x2F; Fill Lights)</strong></h4><p>Setting up lights to hit you from the sides will help you look more three dimensional. It can also give your video a general quality boost because the picture quality is always better when there’s tons of light.</p>
<p>You can use softboxes, LED panels, clamp lights, household lamps, or any other light source you can think of.</p>
<h4 id="Lighting-Tips"><a href="#Lighting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Lighting Tips!"></a><strong>Lighting Tips!</strong></h4><pre><code>* **_Use ‘daylight’ bulbs in any household lighting/clamp lights you use._ This way, your light will all be the same color and you won’t have to do a lot of color correction (the more yellow-colored light most indoor lights give off will make you look orange).**  
</code></pre>
<p>   You can buy daylight-colored bulbs for about $5.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Clamp lights ($10 each) and paper lanterns ($10 each) provide great lighting and are much more affordable than professional lighting kits.</em> The paper lanterns will provide even, diffused, light and the clamp lights will be easy to set up wherever you need them.</strong></li>

Neewer Dimmable Fluorescent Ring Light"></a>1. <strong>Neewer Dimmable Fluorescent Ring Light</strong></h4><p>One cool feature of the Neewer Ring Light is that you can choose between daylight and a more orange-tinted light depending on which of the included filters you use. In almost all situations you’ll want to use white light&#x2F;daylight because the orange light will make you look orange, but if you ever wanted to create a warmer image to achieve a particular effect you’d have that option with this light.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Neewer Ring Light"
                ></p>
<p>This light is dimmable and can be adjusted to the angle that suits your shot. That’s true of our number 2 pick too, and the second place light actually has a slight edge over the Neewer light because its color temperature is 5400K which is slightly closer to daylight than Neewer’s 5500K, but that’s honestly not super important for YouTube. They’re close enough that you won’t be able to tell the difference, and this light is over $100 more affordable.</p>
<h4 id="2-Prismatic-Halo-Ring-Light"><a href="#2-Prismatic-Halo-Ring-Light" class="headerlink" title="2. Prismatic Halo Ring Light"></a>2. <strong>Prismatic Halo Ring Light</strong></h4><p>This lightweight ring light is easy to transport, set up, and mount your phone or camera to. It’s a fluorescent ‘daylight’ (5400K) light, so the colors in your videos will look natural.</p>
<p>This light is dimmable, so you can turn it down if it’s too bright, and the Prismatic Light Stand will allow you to tilt your light to the perfect angle. This will be handy if you’re mounting your camera inside the ring but want to place it slightly above your face instead of having it look at you head on.</p>
<h2 id="Build-Your-Own-Diva-Ring-Light"><a href="#Build-Your-Own-Diva-Ring-Light" class="headerlink" title="Build Your Own Diva Ring Light"></a><strong>Build Your Own Diva Ring Light</strong></h2><p>A ring light is an important tool for a lot of beauty YouTubers, but it doesn’t fit into everyone’s budget. Here’s one popular way to create your own ring light for about $20.</p>
<p><em>A lot of people have done this DIY, but we’re using Kevin’s video because we love how he added the stand.</em></p>
<p> <strong>What you need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A wire wreath frame</li>
<li>Zip ties</li>
<li>LED rope light (16 ft, daylight)</li>
<li>Tinfoil</li>
<li>Metal paper towel stand</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Wrap your wreath frame in tinfoil. Make sure the tinfoil is shaped to the wreath so that there is a curve on the inside where your rope light can sit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Place your rope light inside the curve of your frame. Wind it around for 3 loops so you have 2 rows of lighting tube sitting next to each other.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> Use the zip ties to fasten in the rope light. Wrap them tightly around your frame and lights in several (6-8) places.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong> Cut off the tails of the zip ties.</p>
<p>This is your ring light. Continue to step 5 if you want it to have a stand (you might just want to clip it up somewhere).</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong> Fasten your ring light tightly to your paper towel stand securely with several zip ties. Make sure to fasten it at the bottom (where the excess rope light is coming out of your ring light). Cut off the tails of the zip ties.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Write an outline.</em></strong> You might even want to write yourself a transcript. Having a concrete plan before you start recording will help ensure your tutorial is useful for viewers. You’ll realize where you might need to slow down and show a particular step in more detail, or where your viewers might find a particular step tricky, in a way you want if you just jump into a makeup routine you know perfectly.</li>
<li><strong><em>Layout your supplies.</em></strong> Make sure everything you need for your tutorial is laid out neatly in front of you so you can access it all easily. Try to use clean brushes – it just looks nicer.</li>
<li><strong><em>Tidy up.</em></strong> If you want your viewers to trust you when it comes to aesthetics, it’s important that your studio area is clean and tidy. You may even want to use a backdrop.</li>
<li><strong><em>Do a video test.</em></strong> Before you start your video for real, start recording and shoot some test footage. Watch that back to make sure you like the look of your frame, your face is never blurry, and you’re happy with the overall look of things.</li>
<li><strong><em>Do an audio test.</em></strong> If you’re going to be talking in your video instead of recording a voiceover after, do an audio test to make sure your audience will be able to hear you clearly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording</strong></h2><p>Here are some things to keep in mind while you record your makeup tutorial:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Show what you’re using.</em></strong> When you use a product, brush, or any other beauty supply make sure to let your audience know what you’re using and why you chose it. This isn’t about promoting brands, it’s about making it easy for viewers to duplicate your results.<br>If you’re using autofocus, you can hold products up to the screen and wait for it to kick in. If you’re not using autofocus, just hold them up next to you for a moment. You can also shoot separate closeups of each product and cut them into your main tutorial video.</li>
<li><strong><em>Highlight small details.</em></strong> Describe what you’re doing in a lot of detail and don’t gloss over anything. Assume the person watching your tutorial doesn’t know anything about putting on makeup.</li>
<li><strong><em>Take stills for your thumbnail.</em></strong> Remember to take some still photos of your finished makeup to use in your YouTube thumbnail.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve finished recording and put away all your camera gear, there’s still work to do. You still need to edit your video and post it on YouTube. Here are some tips for that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Add transitions and effects.</em></strong> If you have several clips or even just distinct sections of your main clip, then adding transitions can be a great way to hold your viewers’ attention.<br>If you spend a lot of time on a repetitive step, you may want to speed that part up and make it a time-lapse.</li>
<li><strong><em>Add your intro.</em></strong> Having a short (usually around 5 seconds) intro sequence is a great way to strengthen your personal lifestyle brand. You can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/free-resources.html" >download free intros right here on filmora.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Title your video.</em></strong> Make sure your most important keyword – the type of look you’re creating, or a product you’re reviewing – is near the beginning of your video’s title. Searching for the topic of your video and writing a title similar to the highest-ranking results is a good way to start.<br>Remember to include what type of video you made, i.e. ‘tutorial’, ‘review’, or ‘get ready with me’, in your title. People might include these kinds of words in their search queries and, even if they find your video another way, they’ll probably want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</li>
<li><strong><em>Customize your thumbnail.</em></strong> Again, search for your video’s topic and see what comes up. You want your thumbnail to look related to the top results, but you also want it to jump out at potential viewers. There may be something you can add to the thumbnail photos you took that will help you stand out, like a bright border, an emoji, or a closeup of a product you feature in the video.</li>
<li><strong><em>Write a detailed description.</em></strong> Putting the products you use in your video description will help your viewers, and it’s a great place to include affiliate links if you ever join an affiliate program (like Amazon’s) to generate some revenue.</li>

<h2 id="Finding-Your-Niche-in-Beauty-or-Lifestyle-1"><a href="#Finding-Your-Niche-in-Beauty-or-Lifestyle-1" class="headerlink" title="Finding Your Niche in Beauty or Lifestyle"></a><strong>Finding Your Niche in Beauty or Lifestyle</strong></h2><p>As a new makeup, beauty, or lifestyle YouTuber you’ll be jumping into a category that’s already packed with thousands of channels. In order to gain any momentum, you’ll have to decide on a particular thing you want to be known for. That’s your niche.</p>
<p>People looking for beauty tutorials are often looking for someone who has something in particular in common with them. Hairstyling for a specific ethnicity, for example, is a potential niche because people want to learn how to style their own hair, not a hair in general.</p>
<p>Another way you could find a niche is by taking on a specific area of interest, like a skincare channel with a focus on coping with acne or a makeup channel with a focus on natural products.</p>
<p>  SunKissAlba has a lifestyle channel that focuses on a ‘natural’ niche. She posts videos about every aspect of her lifestyle from putting on makeup to cooking, but natural&#x2F;non-toxic products are a constant theme through everything she does. By niching her channel she hasn’t limited what kinds of videos she can do at all - she posts a huge variety of different types of videos. What she has done is to make her channel particularly valuable to audiences interested in things that are natural or organic.</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy-1"><a href="#Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy-1" class="headerlink" title="Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy"></a><strong>Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy</strong></h2><p>It’s a lot easier to come up with weekly video ideas when you have an overarching strategy.</p>
<p>The easiest way to figure out what kinds of videos you should make (and this can also help determine your niche!) is to think about what you already do and enjoy. If skincare is particularly important to you, for example, then you could build a content strategy that includes things like your favorite sunscreen, what different ingredients in skincare products are for, or even how to make a DIY face mask.</p>
<p>The same thing goes if you love doing big glamourous makeups for going out. Think about what you like, and that will determine what you should talk about in your videos.</p>
<p>Instead of buying new products to use in videos, try to use and showcase what you already have.</p>
<p>Here are some common types of beauty and lifestyle videos:</p>
<p><strong><em>Get Ready With Me:</em></strong> a video where you put your makeup on which helps your audience get to know you better.</p>
<p><strong><em>Monthly Favorites:</em></strong> showcases your favorite products from the last month.</p>
<p><strong><em>Makeup Collection:</em></strong> viewers will want to see what you have.</p>
<p><strong><em>DIY:</em></strong> create something, like a homemade moisturizer, and show your viewers how to make their own.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Makeup Hauls:</em></strong> show off what you’ve bought recently.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lookbooks:</em></strong> put together a few looks based on a theme, like a specific color or event.</p>
<p><strong><em>First Impressions:</em></strong> show yourself using a new product for the first time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Makeup Tutorials:</em></strong> teach your viewers how to achieve a particular look, like a smokey eye.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s In My Bag</em></strong>: empty your handbag to show viewers what you carry around with you, particularly your most essential makeup.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Routine:</em></strong> show viewers your morning skincare routine, or how you usually take your makeup off before bed. Any of your beauty-related routines will be interesting to your followers.</p>
<p> You should also be ready to jump on trends as they jump up. You can get a bump in viewership from people searching for a particular trend. Here are a couple of examples of past trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boyfriend Does My Makeup</li>
<li>Kid’s Makeup Challenge</li>
<li>No Mirror Makeup Challenge</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-to-Get-Products-to-Review-1"><a href="#How-to-Get-Products-to-Review-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Products to Review"></a><strong>How to Get Products to Review</strong></h2><p> You probably already know that a lot of the products popular beauty YouTubers review in their videos were sent to them for free. Brands want to get their products into the hands of creators who have ‘influence’ both in the hopes that their audiences will decide to buy them and as part of generating buzz – getting more people talking about their products so more people become interested.</p>
<p>In order for a brand to consider sending you a free product to review or feature in a video, you will first have to have a large enough following.</p>
<p>What is ‘large enough’? There’s no magic number of YouTube subscribers or Instagram followers. How large your following needs to be will depend on what brands you want to work with, as well as whether your channel has a specific niche.</p>
<p>Large brands will want to work with larger creators. Smaller brands that are still trying to build notoriety may be more open to working with creators whose followings are not as large.</p>
<p>If you have a very specific niche then that could create more opportunities for you as a mid-sized YouTuber. If you specialize in styling curly black hair, and a brand is marketing a product made specifically for styling curly black hair, then your smaller following will be more valuable to that brand than the larger audience of a more general channel.</p>
<p>Here are 4 tips for getting free products for review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow your favorite brands on Instagram and subscribe to their YouTube channels. Make sure to take them when you feature their products in your posts or videos.</li>
<li>Focus on growing your community&#x2F;audience. As you start getting more subscribers and building up momentum for your channel, brands might start reaching out to you. We’ve got some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/27-fun-and-easy-tactics-to-get-more-youtube-subscribers-405.html" >tips on growing your YouTube channel here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Make a pitch to a brand. The first step in this is figuring out who to pitch to. You can send smaller brands DMs via Instagram or Twitter and politely ask for contact info for a PR person. Never ask for free product or sponsorship at this point, just information you can use to contact PR.</li>
<li>Send an email with your pitch to the brand’s PR person. Your email should introduce yourself, describe your content, and talk about what type of audience you have (how many subscribers, where are they located, how old are they, etc. This information is all available in your Creator Studio analytics).<br>Make sure to link to your channel so they can verify what you say (do not hide your subscriber count).<br>Emphasize what value you could provide the brand with (i.e. ‘I’ve had a lot of success with videos on managing acne and I’m sure my subscribers would love to see a review of your cream’) and outline what kind of video you’d like to make (i.e. a five-minute review focusing on the product, or a short feature in a longer makeup tutorial).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Simple-Camera-Setup-for-Beauty-Vloggers-1"><a href="#Simple-Camera-Setup-for-Beauty-Vloggers-1" class="headerlink" title="Simple Camera Setup for Beauty Vloggers"></a><strong>Simple Camera Setup for Beauty Vloggers</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of different ways to set up your camera for a ‘talking head’ video (anything that is primarily you talking to the camera). Keep reading to learn about a popular ring-light setup for beauty videos, or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-ways-to-set-up-your-talking-head-shots-for-youtube-431.html" >click here to learn 4 different camera setups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, this is what you’ll build your setup out of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Camera with a flip-out screen</li>
<li><a href="#ringlights">Ring light</a></li>
<li>Camera-mounted shotgun mic</li>
<li>Tripod (unless you can mount your camera inside your ring light)</li>
</ol>
<p> If you don’t have access to all of the equipment above, try some of these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Smartphone camera</li>
<li><a href="#diy">DIY ring light</a></li>
<li>Smartphone shotgun mic or LAV</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Set your camera and ring light (your camera should be sitting directly behind your ring light, or mounted inside of it) up about 3 feet away from your subject (yourself).</p>
<p>You might want to experiment with sitting at different distances to see how the lighting looks on your face.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Set your camera up a bit higher than your face and tilt it down towards yourself (shooting from slightly above is always more flattering). It should be set up at about a 15° angle to you.</p>

<p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> Check your frame (this is easiest if your camera has a screen that flips out) to make sure there’s not too much empty space in your shot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong> Adjust your camera’s focus so your picture is clear. You may need to set up a lamp, chair, or stuffed animal as a stand-in for yourself while you stand behind the camera adjusting the focus.</p>
<p>Turn off autofocus and adjust your focus manually by turning the focus ring on your lens, if you’re using a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong> Set your f-stop (aperture) so that your depth of field is deep enough for you to lean forwards or backward without becoming blurry.</p>
<p>An aperture of f&#x2F;5.0 is good if you’re going to be moving around a lot, but if you’re not going to be moving much and want a blurry background you might want to go with f&#x2F;2.8 or lower.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Set your ISO (film speed). A lower ISO will give you a darker, but higher quality, image. A higher ISO will lower your quality and give you a brighter image.</p>
<p>ISO 400 should be a happy medium for shooting inside with your ring light, but you may need to try out a couple of settings to find one perfect for your situation.</p>

<h2 id="Lighting-for-Beauty-1"><a href="#Lighting-for-Beauty-1" class="headerlink" title="Lighting for Beauty"></a><strong>Lighting for Beauty</strong></h2><p>The key to achieving a high-quality picture for your beauty video is having a lot of light.</p>
<p>A ring light (whether it’s <a href="#ringlights">one you purchase</a> or <a href="#diy">one you make</a>) will give you even light over your whole face, and that may be enough. Ring lights are considered one of the biggest ‘secrets’ to beauty on YouTube (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.racked.com/2016/6/2/11828904/beauty-vlogger-youtube-ring-lights" >as explained in this Racked article <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p>
<p>There are, however, some reasons you might want additional light:</p>
<h4 id="To-Light-your-Background-Space-1"><a href="#To-Light-your-Background-Space-1" class="headerlink" title="To Light your Background&#x2F;Space"></a><strong>To Light your Background&#x2F;Space</strong></h4><p>If you only have a ring light&#x2F;front light then you may end up looking like you’re surrounded by shadows. If you want more light for your space you can use windows, household lamps, or professional video lights like softboxes or LED panels.</p>

<p>Setting up a light to shine up at you from behind will help you pop out from your background by creating a silhouette.</p>
<p>You can use an LED panel or a household lamp as a backlight.</p>
<h4 id="To-Add-Dimension-to-Your-Face-Side-Lights-Fill-Lights-1"><a href="#To-Add-Dimension-to-Your-Face-Side-Lights-Fill-Lights-1" class="headerlink" title="To Add Dimension to Your Face (Side Lights&#x2F; Fill Lights)"></a><strong>To Add Dimension to Your Face (Side Lights&#x2F; Fill Lights)</strong></h4><p>Setting up lights to hit you from the sides will help you look more three dimensional. It can also give your video a general quality boost because the picture quality is always better when there’s tons of light.</p>
<p>You can use softboxes, LED panels, clamp lights, household lamps, or any other light source you can think of.</p>
<h4 id="Lighting-Tips-1"><a href="#Lighting-Tips-1" class="headerlink" title="Lighting Tips!"></a><strong>Lighting Tips!</strong></h4><pre><code>* **_Use ‘daylight’ bulbs in any household lighting/clamp lights you use._ This way, your light will all be the same color and you won’t have to do a lot of color correction (the more yellow-colored light most indoor lights give off will make you look orange).**  
</code></pre>
<p>   You can buy daylight-colored bulbs for about $5.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Clamp lights ($10 each) and paper lanterns ($10 each) provide great lighting and are much more affordable than professional lighting kits.</em> The paper lanterns will provide even, diffused, light and the clamp lights will be easy to set up wherever you need them.</strong></li>

<h2 id="Top-Ring-Lights-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Top-Ring-Lights-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Top Ring Lights for YouTube"></a><strong>Top Ring Lights for YouTube</strong></h2><h4 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="1-Neewer-Dimmable-Fluorescent-Ring-Light-1"><a href="#1-Neewer-Dimmable-Fluorescent-Ring-Light-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Neewer Dimmable Fluorescent Ring Light"></a>1. <strong>Neewer Dimmable Fluorescent Ring Light</strong></h4><p>One cool feature of the Neewer Ring Light is that you can choose between daylight and a more orange-tinted light depending on which of the included filters you use. In almost all situations you’ll want to use white light&#x2F;daylight because the orange light will make you look orange, but if you ever wanted to create a warmer image to achieve a particular effect you’d have that option with this light.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Neewer Ring Light"
                ></p>
<p>This light is dimmable and can be adjusted to the angle that suits your shot. That’s true of our number 2 pick too, and the second place light actually has a slight edge over the Neewer light because its color temperature is 5400K which is slightly closer to daylight than Neewer’s 5500K, but that’s honestly not super important for YouTube. They’re close enough that you won’t be able to tell the difference, and this light is over $100 more affordable.</p>
<h4 id="2-Prismatic-Halo-Ring-Light-1"><a href="#2-Prismatic-Halo-Ring-Light-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Prismatic Halo Ring Light"></a>2. <strong>Prismatic Halo Ring Light</strong></h4><p>This lightweight ring light is easy to transport, set up, and mount your phone or camera to. It’s a fluorescent ‘daylight’ (5400K) light, so the colors in your videos will look natural.</p>
<p>This light is dimmable, so you can turn it down if it’s too bright, and the Prismatic Light Stand will allow you to tilt your light to the perfect angle. This will be handy if you’re mounting your camera inside the ring but want to place it slightly above your face instead of having it look at you head on.</p>
<h2 id="Build-Your-Own-Diva-Ring-Light-1"><a href="#Build-Your-Own-Diva-Ring-Light-1" class="headerlink" title="Build Your Own Diva Ring Light"></a><strong>Build Your Own Diva Ring Light</strong></h2><p>A ring light is an important tool for a lot of beauty YouTubers, but it doesn’t fit into everyone’s budget. Here’s one popular way to create your own ring light for about $20.</p>
<p><em>A lot of people have done this DIY, but we’re using Kevin’s video because we love how he added the stand.</em></p>
<p> <strong>What you need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A wire wreath frame</li>
<li>Zip ties</li>
<li>LED rope light (16 ft, daylight)</li>
<li>Tinfoil</li>
<li>Metal paper towel stand</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Wrap your wreath frame in tinfoil. Make sure the tinfoil is shaped to the wreath so that there is a curve on the inside where your rope light can sit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Place your rope light inside the curve of your frame. Wind it around for 3 loops so you have 2 rows of lighting tube sitting next to each other.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> Use the zip ties to fasten in the rope light. Wrap them tightly around your frame and lights in several (6-8) places.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong> Cut off the tails of the zip ties.</p>
<p>This is your ring light. Continue to step 5 if you want it to have a stand (you might just want to clip it up somewhere).</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong> Fasten your ring light tightly to your paper towel stand securely with several zip ties. Make sure to fasten it at the bottom (where the excess rope light is coming out of your ring light). Cut off the tails of the zip ties.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Write an outline.</em></strong> You might even want to write yourself a transcript. Having a concrete plan before you start recording will help ensure your tutorial is useful for viewers. You’ll realize where you might need to slow down and show a particular step in more detail, or where your viewers might find a particular step tricky, in a way you want if you just jump into a makeup routine you know perfectly.</li>
<li><strong><em>Layout your supplies.</em></strong> Make sure everything you need for your tutorial is laid out neatly in front of you so you can access it all easily. Try to use clean brushes – it just looks nicer.</li>
<li><strong><em>Tidy up.</em></strong> If you want your viewers to trust you when it comes to aesthetics, it’s important that your studio area is clean and tidy. You may even want to use a backdrop.</li>
<li><strong><em>Do a video test.</em></strong> Before you start your video for real, start recording and shoot some test footage. Watch that back to make sure you like the look of your frame, your face is never blurry, and you’re happy with the overall look of things.</li>
<li><strong><em>Do an audio test.</em></strong> If you’re going to be talking in your video instead of recording a voiceover after, do an audio test to make sure your audience will be able to hear you clearly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording</strong></h2><p>Here are some things to keep in mind while you record your makeup tutorial:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Show what you’re using.</em></strong> When you use a product, brush, or any other beauty supply make sure to let your audience know what you’re using and why you chose it. This isn’t about promoting brands, it’s about making it easy for viewers to duplicate your results.<br>If you’re using autofocus, you can hold products up to the screen and wait for it to kick in. If you’re not using autofocus, just hold them up next to you for a moment. You can also shoot separate closeups of each product and cut them into your main tutorial video.</li>
<li><strong><em>Highlight small details.</em></strong> Describe what you’re doing in a lot of detail and don’t gloss over anything. Assume the person watching your tutorial doesn’t know anything about putting on makeup.</li>
<li><strong><em>Take stills for your thumbnail.</em></strong> Remember to take some still photos of your finished makeup to use in your YouTube thumbnail.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve finished recording and put away all your camera gear, there’s still work to do. You still need to edit your video and post it on YouTube. Here are some tips for that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Add transitions and effects.</em></strong> If you have several clips or even just distinct sections of your main clip, then adding transitions can be a great way to hold your viewers’ attention.<br>If you spend a lot of time on a repetitive step, you may want to speed that part up and make it a time-lapse.</li>
<li><strong><em>Add your intro.</em></strong> Having a short (usually around 5 seconds) intro sequence is a great way to strengthen your personal lifestyle brand. You can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/free-resources.html" >download free intros right here on filmora.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Title your video.</em></strong> Make sure your most important keyword – the type of look you’re creating, or a product you’re reviewing – is near the beginning of your video’s title. Searching for the topic of your video and writing a title similar to the highest-ranking results is a good way to start.<br>Remember to include what type of video you made, i.e. ‘tutorial’, ‘review’, or ‘get ready with me’, in your title. People might include these kinds of words in their search queries and, even if they find your video another way, they’ll probably want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</li>
<li><strong><em>Customize your thumbnail.</em></strong> Again, search for your video’s topic and see what comes up. You want your thumbnail to look related to the top results, but you also want it to jump out at potential viewers. There may be something you can add to the thumbnail photos you took that will help you stand out, like a bright border, an emoji, or a closeup of a product you feature in the video.</li>
<li><strong><em>Write a detailed description.</em></strong> Putting the products you use in your video description will help your viewers, and it’s a great place to include affiliate links if you ever join an affiliate program (like Amazon’s) to generate some revenue.</li>

<h2 id="Finding-Your-Niche-in-Beauty-or-Lifestyle-2"><a href="#Finding-Your-Niche-in-Beauty-or-Lifestyle-2" class="headerlink" title="Finding Your Niche in Beauty or Lifestyle"></a><strong>Finding Your Niche in Beauty or Lifestyle</strong></h2><p>As a new makeup, beauty, or lifestyle YouTuber you’ll be jumping into a category that’s already packed with thousands of channels. In order to gain any momentum, you’ll have to decide on a particular thing you want to be known for. That’s your niche.</p>
<p>People looking for beauty tutorials are often looking for someone who has something in particular in common with them. Hairstyling for a specific ethnicity, for example, is a potential niche because people want to learn how to style their own hair, not a hair in general.</p>
<p>Another way you could find a niche is by taking on a specific area of interest, like a skincare channel with a focus on coping with acne or a makeup channel with a focus on natural products.</p>
<p>  SunKissAlba has a lifestyle channel that focuses on a ‘natural’ niche. She posts videos about every aspect of her lifestyle from putting on makeup to cooking, but natural&#x2F;non-toxic products are a constant theme through everything she does. By niching her channel she hasn’t limited what kinds of videos she can do at all - she posts a huge variety of different types of videos. What she has done is to make her channel particularly valuable to audiences interested in things that are natural or organic.</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy-2"><a href="#Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy-2" class="headerlink" title="Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy"></a><strong>Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy</strong></h2><p>It’s a lot easier to come up with weekly video ideas when you have an overarching strategy.</p>
<p>The easiest way to figure out what kinds of videos you should make (and this can also help determine your niche!) is to think about what you already do and enjoy. If skincare is particularly important to you, for example, then you could build a content strategy that includes things like your favorite sunscreen, what different ingredients in skincare products are for, or even how to make a DIY face mask.</p>
<p>The same thing goes if you love doing big glamourous makeups for going out. Think about what you like, and that will determine what you should talk about in your videos.</p>
<p>Instead of buying new products to use in videos, try to use and showcase what you already have.</p>
<p>Here are some common types of beauty and lifestyle videos:</p>
<p><strong><em>Get Ready With Me:</em></strong> a video where you put your makeup on which helps your audience get to know you better.</p>
<p><strong><em>Monthly Favorites:</em></strong> showcases your favorite products from the last month.</p>
<p><strong><em>Makeup Collection:</em></strong> viewers will want to see what you have.</p>
<p><strong><em>DIY:</em></strong> create something, like a homemade moisturizer, and show your viewers how to make their own.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Makeup Hauls:</em></strong> show off what you’ve bought recently.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lookbooks:</em></strong> put together a few looks based on a theme, like a specific color or event.</p>
<p><strong><em>First Impressions:</em></strong> show yourself using a new product for the first time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Makeup Tutorials:</em></strong> teach your viewers how to achieve a particular look, like a smokey eye.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s In My Bag</em></strong>: empty your handbag to show viewers what you carry around with you, particularly your most essential makeup.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Routine:</em></strong> show viewers your morning skincare routine, or how you usually take your makeup off before bed. Any of your beauty-related routines will be interesting to your followers.</p>
<p> You should also be ready to jump on trends as they jump up. You can get a bump in viewership from people searching for a particular trend. Here are a couple of examples of past trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boyfriend Does My Makeup</li>
<li>Kid’s Makeup Challenge</li>
<li>No Mirror Makeup Challenge</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-to-Get-Products-to-Review-2"><a href="#How-to-Get-Products-to-Review-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Products to Review"></a><strong>How to Get Products to Review</strong></h2><p> You probably already know that a lot of the products popular beauty YouTubers review in their videos were sent to them for free. Brands want to get their products into the hands of creators who have ‘influence’ both in the hopes that their audiences will decide to buy them and as part of generating buzz – getting more people talking about their products so more people become interested.</p>
<p>In order for a brand to consider sending you a free product to review or feature in a video, you will first have to have a large enough following.</p>
<p>What is ‘large enough’? There’s no magic number of YouTube subscribers or Instagram followers. How large your following needs to be will depend on what brands you want to work with, as well as whether your channel has a specific niche.</p>
<p>Large brands will want to work with larger creators. Smaller brands that are still trying to build notoriety may be more open to working with creators whose followings are not as large.</p>
<p>If you have a very specific niche then that could create more opportunities for you as a mid-sized YouTuber. If you specialize in styling curly black hair, and a brand is marketing a product made specifically for styling curly black hair, then your smaller following will be more valuable to that brand than the larger audience of a more general channel.</p>
<p>Here are 4 tips for getting free products for review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow your favorite brands on Instagram and subscribe to their YouTube channels. Make sure to take them when you feature their products in your posts or videos.</li>
<li>Focus on growing your community&#x2F;audience. As you start getting more subscribers and building up momentum for your channel, brands might start reaching out to you. We’ve got some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/27-fun-and-easy-tactics-to-get-more-youtube-subscribers-405.html" >tips on growing your YouTube channel here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Make a pitch to a brand. The first step in this is figuring out who to pitch to. You can send smaller brands DMs via Instagram or Twitter and politely ask for contact info for a PR person. Never ask for free product or sponsorship at this point, just information you can use to contact PR.</li>
<li>Send an email with your pitch to the brand’s PR person. Your email should introduce yourself, describe your content, and talk about what type of audience you have (how many subscribers, where are they located, how old are they, etc. This information is all available in your Creator Studio analytics).<br>Make sure to link to your channel so they can verify what you say (do not hide your subscriber count).<br>Emphasize what value you could provide the brand with (i.e. ‘I’ve had a lot of success with videos on managing acne and I’m sure my subscribers would love to see a review of your cream’) and outline what kind of video you’d like to make (i.e. a five-minute review focusing on the product, or a short feature in a longer makeup tutorial).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Simple-Camera-Setup-for-Beauty-Vloggers-2"><a href="#Simple-Camera-Setup-for-Beauty-Vloggers-2" class="headerlink" title="Simple Camera Setup for Beauty Vloggers"></a><strong>Simple Camera Setup for Beauty Vloggers</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of different ways to set up your camera for a ‘talking head’ video (anything that is primarily you talking to the camera). Keep reading to learn about a popular ring-light setup for beauty videos, or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-ways-to-set-up-your-talking-head-shots-for-youtube-431.html" >click here to learn 4 different camera setups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, this is what you’ll build your setup out of:</p>

<li>Camera-mounted shotgun mic</li>
<li>Tripod (unless you can mount your camera inside your ring light)</li>

<p> If you don’t have access to all of the equipment above, try some of these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Smartphone camera</li>
<li><a href="#diy">DIY ring light</a></li>
<li>Smartphone shotgun mic or LAV</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Set your camera and ring light (your camera should be sitting directly behind your ring light, or mounted inside of it) up about 3 feet away from your subject (yourself).</p>
<p>You might want to experiment with sitting at different distances to see how the lighting looks on your face.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Set your camera up a bit higher than your face and tilt it down towards yourself (shooting from slightly above is always more flattering). It should be set up at about a 15° angle to you.</p>

                      alt="tilt down your camera"
                ></p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> Check your frame (this is easiest if your camera has a screen that flips out) to make sure there’s not too much empty space in your shot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong> Adjust your camera’s focus so your picture is clear. You may need to set up a lamp, chair, or stuffed animal as a stand-in for yourself while you stand behind the camera adjusting the focus.</p>
<p>Turn off autofocus and adjust your focus manually by turning the focus ring on your lens, if you’re using a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong> Set your f-stop (aperture) so that your depth of field is deep enough for you to lean forwards or backward without becoming blurry.</p>
<p>An aperture of f&#x2F;5.0 is good if you’re going to be moving around a lot, but if you’re not going to be moving much and want a blurry background you might want to go with f&#x2F;2.8 or lower.</p>

                      alt="set f stop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Set your ISO (film speed). A lower ISO will give you a darker, but higher quality, image. A higher ISO will lower your quality and give you a brighter image.</p>
<p>ISO 400 should be a happy medium for shooting inside with your ring light, but you may need to try out a couple of settings to find one perfect for your situation.</p>

<h2 id="Lighting-for-Beauty-2"><a href="#Lighting-for-Beauty-2" class="headerlink" title="Lighting for Beauty"></a><strong>Lighting for Beauty</strong></h2><p>The key to achieving a high-quality picture for your beauty video is having a lot of light.</p>
<p>A ring light (whether it’s <a href="#ringlights">one you purchase</a> or <a href="#diy">one you make</a>) will give you even light over your whole face, and that may be enough. Ring lights are considered one of the biggest ‘secrets’ to beauty on YouTube (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.racked.com/2016/6/2/11828904/beauty-vlogger-youtube-ring-lights" >as explained in this Racked article <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p>
<p>There are, however, some reasons you might want additional light:</p>
<h4 id="To-Light-your-Background-Space-2"><a href="#To-Light-your-Background-Space-2" class="headerlink" title="To Light your Background&#x2F;Space"></a><strong>To Light your Background&#x2F;Space</strong></h4><p>If you only have a ring light&#x2F;front light then you may end up looking like you’re surrounded by shadows. If you want more light for your space you can use windows, household lamps, or professional video lights like softboxes or LED panels.</p>

<p>Setting up a light to shine up at you from behind will help you pop out from your background by creating a silhouette.</p>
<p>You can use an LED panel or a household lamp as a backlight.</p>
<h4 id="To-Add-Dimension-to-Your-Face-Side-Lights-Fill-Lights-2"><a href="#To-Add-Dimension-to-Your-Face-Side-Lights-Fill-Lights-2" class="headerlink" title="To Add Dimension to Your Face (Side Lights&#x2F; Fill Lights)"></a><strong>To Add Dimension to Your Face (Side Lights&#x2F; Fill Lights)</strong></h4><p>Setting up lights to hit you from the sides will help you look more three dimensional. It can also give your video a general quality boost because the picture quality is always better when there’s tons of light.</p>
<p>You can use softboxes, LED panels, clamp lights, household lamps, or any other light source you can think of.</p>
<h4 id="Lighting-Tips-2"><a href="#Lighting-Tips-2" class="headerlink" title="Lighting Tips!"></a><strong>Lighting Tips!</strong></h4><pre><code>* **_Use ‘daylight’ bulbs in any household lighting/clamp lights you use._ This way, your light will all be the same color and you won’t have to do a lot of color correction (the more yellow-colored light most indoor lights give off will make you look orange).**  
</code></pre>
<p>   You can buy daylight-colored bulbs for about $5.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Clamp lights ($10 each) and paper lanterns ($10 each) provide great lighting and are much more affordable than professional lighting kits.</em> The paper lanterns will provide even, diffused, light and the clamp lights will be easy to set up wherever you need them.</strong></li>

<h2 id="Top-Ring-Lights-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Top-Ring-Lights-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Top Ring Lights for YouTube"></a><strong>Top Ring Lights for YouTube</strong></h2><h4 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="1-Neewer-Dimmable-Fluorescent-Ring-Light-2"><a href="#1-Neewer-Dimmable-Fluorescent-Ring-Light-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Neewer Dimmable Fluorescent Ring Light"></a>1. <strong>Neewer Dimmable Fluorescent Ring Light</strong></h4><p>One cool feature of the Neewer Ring Light is that you can choose between daylight and a more orange-tinted light depending on which of the included filters you use. In almost all situations you’ll want to use white light&#x2F;daylight because the orange light will make you look orange, but if you ever wanted to create a warmer image to achieve a particular effect you’d have that option with this light.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Neewer Ring Light"
                ></p>
<p>This light is dimmable and can be adjusted to the angle that suits your shot. That’s true of our number 2 pick too, and the second place light actually has a slight edge over the Neewer light because its color temperature is 5400K which is slightly closer to daylight than Neewer’s 5500K, but that’s honestly not super important for YouTube. They’re close enough that you won’t be able to tell the difference, and this light is over $100 more affordable.</p>
<h4 id="2-Prismatic-Halo-Ring-Light-2"><a href="#2-Prismatic-Halo-Ring-Light-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Prismatic Halo Ring Light"></a>2. <strong>Prismatic Halo Ring Light</strong></h4><p>This lightweight ring light is easy to transport, set up, and mount your phone or camera to. It’s a fluorescent ‘daylight’ (5400K) light, so the colors in your videos will look natural.</p>
<p>This light is dimmable, so you can turn it down if it’s too bright, and the Prismatic Light Stand will allow you to tilt your light to the perfect angle. This will be handy if you’re mounting your camera inside the ring but want to place it slightly above your face instead of having it look at you head on.</p>
<h2 id="Build-Your-Own-Diva-Ring-Light-2"><a href="#Build-Your-Own-Diva-Ring-Light-2" class="headerlink" title="Build Your Own Diva Ring Light"></a><strong>Build Your Own Diva Ring Light</strong></h2><p>A ring light is an important tool for a lot of beauty YouTubers, but it doesn’t fit into everyone’s budget. Here’s one popular way to create your own ring light for about $20.</p>
<p><em>A lot of people have done this DIY, but we’re using Kevin’s video because we love how he added the stand.</em></p>
<p> <strong>What you need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A wire wreath frame</li>
<li>Zip ties</li>
<li>LED rope light (16 ft, daylight)</li>
<li>Tinfoil</li>
<li>Metal paper towel stand</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Wrap your wreath frame in tinfoil. Make sure the tinfoil is shaped to the wreath so that there is a curve on the inside where your rope light can sit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Place your rope light inside the curve of your frame. Wind it around for 3 loops so you have 2 rows of lighting tube sitting next to each other.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> Use the zip ties to fasten in the rope light. Wrap them tightly around your frame and lights in several (6-8) places.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong> Cut off the tails of the zip ties.</p>
<p>This is your ring light. Continue to step 5 if you want it to have a stand (you might just want to clip it up somewhere).</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong> Fasten your ring light tightly to your paper towel stand securely with several zip ties. Make sure to fasten it at the bottom (where the excess rope light is coming out of your ring light). Cut off the tails of the zip ties.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Write an outline.</em></strong> You might even want to write yourself a transcript. Having a concrete plan before you start recording will help ensure your tutorial is useful for viewers. You’ll realize where you might need to slow down and show a particular step in more detail, or where your viewers might find a particular step tricky, in a way you want if you just jump into a makeup routine you know perfectly.</li>
<li><strong><em>Layout your supplies.</em></strong> Make sure everything you need for your tutorial is laid out neatly in front of you so you can access it all easily. Try to use clean brushes – it just looks nicer.</li>
<li><strong><em>Tidy up.</em></strong> If you want your viewers to trust you when it comes to aesthetics, it’s important that your studio area is clean and tidy. You may even want to use a backdrop.</li>
<li><strong><em>Do a video test.</em></strong> Before you start your video for real, start recording and shoot some test footage. Watch that back to make sure you like the look of your frame, your face is never blurry, and you’re happy with the overall look of things.</li>
<li><strong><em>Do an audio test.</em></strong> If you’re going to be talking in your video instead of recording a voiceover after, do an audio test to make sure your audience will be able to hear you clearly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording-2"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording</strong></h2><p>Here are some things to keep in mind while you record your makeup tutorial:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Show what you’re using.</em></strong> When you use a product, brush, or any other beauty supply make sure to let your audience know what you’re using and why you chose it. This isn’t about promoting brands, it’s about making it easy for viewers to duplicate your results.<br>If you’re using autofocus, you can hold products up to the screen and wait for it to kick in. If you’re not using autofocus, just hold them up next to you for a moment. You can also shoot separate closeups of each product and cut them into your main tutorial video.</li>
<li><strong><em>Highlight small details.</em></strong> Describe what you’re doing in a lot of detail and don’t gloss over anything. Assume the person watching your tutorial doesn’t know anything about putting on makeup.</li>
<li><strong><em>Take stills for your thumbnail.</em></strong> Remember to take some still photos of your finished makeup to use in your YouTube thumbnail.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting-2"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve finished recording and put away all your camera gear, there’s still work to do. You still need to edit your video and post it on YouTube. Here are some tips for that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Add transitions and effects.</em></strong> If you have several clips or even just distinct sections of your main clip, then adding transitions can be a great way to hold your viewers’ attention.<br>If you spend a lot of time on a repetitive step, you may want to speed that part up and make it a time-lapse.</li>
<li><strong><em>Add your intro.</em></strong> Having a short (usually around 5 seconds) intro sequence is a great way to strengthen your personal lifestyle brand. You can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/free-resources.html" >download free intros right here on filmora.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Title your video.</em></strong> Make sure your most important keyword – the type of look you’re creating, or a product you’re reviewing – is near the beginning of your video’s title. Searching for the topic of your video and writing a title similar to the highest-ranking results is a good way to start.<br>Remember to include what type of video you made, i.e. ‘tutorial’, ‘review’, or ‘get ready with me’, in your title. People might include these kinds of words in their search queries and, even if they find your video another way, they’ll probably want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</li>
<li><strong><em>Customize your thumbnail.</em></strong> Again, search for your video’s topic and see what comes up. You want your thumbnail to look related to the top results, but you also want it to jump out at potential viewers. There may be something you can add to the thumbnail photos you took that will help you stand out, like a bright border, an emoji, or a closeup of a product you feature in the video.</li>
<li><strong><em>Write a detailed description.</em></strong> Putting the products you use in your video description will help your viewers, and it’s a great place to include affiliate links if you ever join an affiliate program (like Amazon’s) to generate some revenue.</li>

<h2 id="Finding-Your-Niche-in-Beauty-or-Lifestyle-3"><a href="#Finding-Your-Niche-in-Beauty-or-Lifestyle-3" class="headerlink" title="Finding Your Niche in Beauty or Lifestyle"></a><strong>Finding Your Niche in Beauty or Lifestyle</strong></h2><p>As a new makeup, beauty, or lifestyle YouTuber you’ll be jumping into a category that’s already packed with thousands of channels. In order to gain any momentum, you’ll have to decide on a particular thing you want to be known for. That’s your niche.</p>
<p>People looking for beauty tutorials are often looking for someone who has something in particular in common with them. Hairstyling for a specific ethnicity, for example, is a potential niche because people want to learn how to style their own hair, not a hair in general.</p>
<p>Another way you could find a niche is by taking on a specific area of interest, like a skincare channel with a focus on coping with acne or a makeup channel with a focus on natural products.</p>
<p>  SunKissAlba has a lifestyle channel that focuses on a ‘natural’ niche. She posts videos about every aspect of her lifestyle from putting on makeup to cooking, but natural&#x2F;non-toxic products are a constant theme through everything she does. By niching her channel she hasn’t limited what kinds of videos she can do at all - she posts a huge variety of different types of videos. What she has done is to make her channel particularly valuable to audiences interested in things that are natural or organic.</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy-3"><a href="#Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy-3" class="headerlink" title="Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy"></a><strong>Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy</strong></h2><p>It’s a lot easier to come up with weekly video ideas when you have an overarching strategy.</p>
<p>The easiest way to figure out what kinds of videos you should make (and this can also help determine your niche!) is to think about what you already do and enjoy. If skincare is particularly important to you, for example, then you could build a content strategy that includes things like your favorite sunscreen, what different ingredients in skincare products are for, or even how to make a DIY face mask.</p>
<p>The same thing goes if you love doing big glamourous makeups for going out. Think about what you like, and that will determine what you should talk about in your videos.</p>
<p>Instead of buying new products to use in videos, try to use and showcase what you already have.</p>
<p>Here are some common types of beauty and lifestyle videos:</p>
<p><strong><em>Get Ready With Me:</em></strong> a video where you put your makeup on which helps your audience get to know you better.</p>
<p><strong><em>Monthly Favorites:</em></strong> showcases your favorite products from the last month.</p>
<p><strong><em>Makeup Collection:</em></strong> viewers will want to see what you have.</p>
<p><strong><em>DIY:</em></strong> create something, like a homemade moisturizer, and show your viewers how to make their own.</p>
<p> <strong><em>Makeup Hauls:</em></strong> show off what you’ve bought recently.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lookbooks:</em></strong> put together a few looks based on a theme, like a specific color or event.</p>
<p><strong><em>First Impressions:</em></strong> show yourself using a new product for the first time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Makeup Tutorials:</em></strong> teach your viewers how to achieve a particular look, like a smokey eye.</p>
<p><strong><em>What’s In My Bag</em></strong>: empty your handbag to show viewers what you carry around with you, particularly your most essential makeup.</p>
<p><strong><em>My Routine:</em></strong> show viewers your morning skincare routine, or how you usually take your makeup off before bed. Any of your beauty-related routines will be interesting to your followers.</p>
<p> You should also be ready to jump on trends as they jump up. You can get a bump in viewership from people searching for a particular trend. Here are a couple of examples of past trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boyfriend Does My Makeup</li>
<li>Kid’s Makeup Challenge</li>
<li>No Mirror Makeup Challenge</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-to-Get-Products-to-Review-3"><a href="#How-to-Get-Products-to-Review-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Products to Review"></a><strong>How to Get Products to Review</strong></h2><p> You probably already know that a lot of the products popular beauty YouTubers review in their videos were sent to them for free. Brands want to get their products into the hands of creators who have ‘influence’ both in the hopes that their audiences will decide to buy them and as part of generating buzz – getting more people talking about their products so more people become interested.</p>
<p>In order for a brand to consider sending you a free product to review or feature in a video, you will first have to have a large enough following.</p>
<p>What is ‘large enough’? There’s no magic number of YouTube subscribers or Instagram followers. How large your following needs to be will depend on what brands you want to work with, as well as whether your channel has a specific niche.</p>
<p>Large brands will want to work with larger creators. Smaller brands that are still trying to build notoriety may be more open to working with creators whose followings are not as large.</p>
<p>If you have a very specific niche then that could create more opportunities for you as a mid-sized YouTuber. If you specialize in styling curly black hair, and a brand is marketing a product made specifically for styling curly black hair, then your smaller following will be more valuable to that brand than the larger audience of a more general channel.</p>
<p>Here are 4 tips for getting free products for review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow your favorite brands on Instagram and subscribe to their YouTube channels. Make sure to take them when you feature their products in your posts or videos.</li>
<li>Focus on growing your community&#x2F;audience. As you start getting more subscribers and building up momentum for your channel, brands might start reaching out to you. We’ve got some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/27-fun-and-easy-tactics-to-get-more-youtube-subscribers-405.html" >tips on growing your YouTube channel here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Make a pitch to a brand. The first step in this is figuring out who to pitch to. You can send smaller brands DMs via Instagram or Twitter and politely ask for contact info for a PR person. Never ask for free product or sponsorship at this point, just information you can use to contact PR.</li>
<li>Send an email with your pitch to the brand’s PR person.

Keep reading to learn about a popular ring-light setup for beauty videos, or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-ways-to-set-up-your-talking-head-shots-for-youtube-431.html" >click here to learn 4 different camera setups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>In an ideal situation, this is what you’ll build your setup out of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Camera with a flip-out screen</li>
<li><a href="#ringlights">Ring light</a></li>
<li>Camera-mounted shotgun mic</li>
<li>Tripod (unless you can mount your camera inside your ring light)</li>
</ol>
<p> If you don’t have access to all of the equipment above, try some of these:</p>
<ol>
<li>Smartphone camera</li>
<li><a href="#diy">DIY ring light</a></li>
<li>Smartphone shotgun mic or LAV</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Set your camera and ring light (your camera should be sitting directly behind your ring light, or mounted inside of it) up about 3 feet away from your subject (yourself).</p>
<p>You might want to experiment with sitting at different distances to see how the lighting looks on your face.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Set your camera up a bit higher than your face and tilt it down towards yourself (shooting from slightly above is always more flattering). It should be set up at about a 15° angle to you.</p>

                      alt="tilt down your camera"
                ></p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> Check your frame (this is easiest if your camera has a screen that flips out) to make sure there’s not too much empty space in your shot.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong> Adjust your camera’s focus so your picture is clear. You may need to set up a lamp, chair, or stuffed animal as a stand-in for yourself while you stand behind the camera adjusting the focus.</p>
<p>Turn off autofocus and adjust your focus manually by turning the focus ring on your lens, if you’re using a DSLR or mirrorless camera.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong> Set your f-stop (aperture) so that your depth of field is deep enough for you to lean forwards or backward without becoming blurry.</p>
<p>An aperture of f&#x2F;5.0 is good if you’re going to be moving around a lot, but if you’re not going to be moving much and want a blurry background you might want to go with f&#x2F;2.8 or lower.</p>

                      alt="set f stop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Set your ISO (film speed). A lower ISO will give you a darker, but higher quality, image. A higher ISO will lower your quality and give you a brighter image.</p>
<p>ISO 400 should be a happy medium for shooting inside with your ring light, but you may need to try out a couple of settings to find one perfect for your situation.</p>

<h2 id="Lighting-for-Beauty-3"><a href="#Lighting-for-Beauty-3" class="headerlink" title="Lighting for Beauty"></a><strong>Lighting for Beauty</strong></h2><p>The key to achieving a high-quality picture for your beauty video is having a lot of light.</p>
<p>A ring light (whether it’s <a href="#ringlights">one you purchase</a> or <a href="#diy">one you make</a>) will give you even light over your whole face, and that may be enough. Ring lights are considered one of the biggest ‘secrets’ to beauty on YouTube (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.racked.com/2016/6/2/11828904/beauty-vlogger-youtube-ring-lights" >as explained in this Racked article <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p>
<p>There are, however, some reasons you might want additional light:</p>
<h4 id="To-Light-your-Background-Space-3"><a href="#To-Light-your-Background-Space-3" class="headerlink" title="To Light your Background&#x2F;Space"></a><strong>To Light your Background&#x2F;Space</strong></h4><p>If you only have a ring light&#x2F;front light then you may end up looking like you’re surrounded by shadows. If you want more light for your space you can use windows, household lamps, or professional video lights like softboxes or LED panels.</p>
<p> <img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Setting up a light to shine up at you from behind will help you pop out from your background by creating a silhouette.</p>
<p>You can use an LED panel or a household lamp as a backlight.</p>
<h4 id="To-Add-Dimension-to-Your-Face-Side-Lights-Fill-Lights-3"><a href="#To-Add-Dimension-to-Your-Face-Side-Lights-Fill-Lights-3" class="headerlink" title="To Add Dimension to Your Face (Side Lights&#x2F; Fill Lights)"></a><strong>To Add Dimension to Your Face (Side Lights&#x2F; Fill Lights)</strong></h4><p>Setting up lights to hit you from the sides will help you look more three dimensional. It can also give your video a general quality boost because the picture quality is always better when there’s tons of light.</p>
<p>You can use softboxes, LED panels, clamp lights, household lamps, or any other light source you can think of.</p>
<h4 id="Lighting-Tips-3"><a href="#Lighting-Tips-3" class="headerlink" title="Lighting Tips!"></a><strong>Lighting Tips!</strong></h4><pre><code>* **_Use ‘daylight’ bulbs in any household lighting/clamp lights you use._ This way, your light will all be the same color and you won’t have to do a lot of color correction (the more yellow-colored light most indoor lights give off will make you look orange).**  
</code></pre>
<p>   You can buy daylight-colored bulbs for about $5.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Clamp lights ($10 each) and paper lanterns ($10 each) provide great lighting and are much more affordable than professional lighting kits.</em> The paper lanterns will provide even, diffused, light and the clamp lights will be easy to set up wherever you need them.</strong></li>

<h2 id="Top-Ring-Lights-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Top-Ring-Lights-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Top Ring Lights for YouTube"></a><strong>Top Ring Lights for YouTube</strong></h2><h4 id="-3"><a href="#-3" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="1-Neewer-Dimmable-Fluorescent-Ring-Light-3"><a href="#1-Neewer-Dimmable-Fluorescent-Ring-Light-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Neewer Dimmable Fluorescent Ring Light"></a>1. <strong>Neewer Dimmable Fluorescent Ring Light</strong></h4><p>One cool feature of the Neewer Ring Light is that you can choose between daylight and a more orange-tinted light depending on which of the included filters you use. In almost all situations you’ll want to use white light&#x2F;daylight because the orange light will make you look orange, but if you ever wanted to create a warmer image to achieve a particular effect you’d have that option with this light.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Neewer Ring Light"
                ></p>
<p>This light is dimmable and can be adjusted to the angle that suits your shot. That’s true of our number 2 pick too, and the second place light actually has a slight edge over the Neewer light because its color temperature is 5400K which is slightly closer to daylight than Neewer’s 5500K, but that’s honestly not super important for YouTube. They’re close enough that you won’t be able to tell the difference, and this light is over $100 more affordable.</p>
<h4 id="2-Prismatic-Halo-Ring-Light-3"><a href="#2-Prismatic-Halo-Ring-Light-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Prismatic Halo Ring Light"></a>2. <strong>Prismatic Halo Ring Light</strong></h4><p>This lightweight ring light is easy to transport, set up, and mount your phone or camera to. It’s a fluorescent ‘daylight’ (5400K) light, so the colors in your videos will look natural.</p>
<p>This light is dimmable, so you can turn it down if it’s too bright, and the Prismatic Light Stand will allow you to tilt your light to the perfect angle. This will be handy if you’re mounting your camera inside the ring but want to place it slightly above your face instead of having it look at you head on.</p>
<h2 id="Build-Your-Own-Diva-Ring-Light-3"><a href="#Build-Your-Own-Diva-Ring-Light-3" class="headerlink" title="Build Your Own Diva Ring Light"></a><strong>Build Your Own Diva Ring Light</strong></h2><p>A ring light is an important tool for a lot of beauty YouTubers, but it doesn’t fit into everyone’s budget. Here’s one popular way to create your own ring light for about $20.</p>
<p><em>A lot of people have done this DIY, but we’re using Kevin’s video because we love how he added the stand.</em></p>
<p> <strong>What you need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A wire wreath frame</li>
<li>Zip ties</li>
<li>LED rope light (16 ft, daylight)</li>
<li>Tinfoil</li>
<li>Metal paper towel stand</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Wrap your wreath frame in tinfoil. Make sure the tinfoil is shaped to the wreath so that there is a curve on the inside where your rope light can sit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Place your rope light inside the curve of your frame. Wind it around for 3 loops so you have 2 rows of lighting tube sitting next to each other.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> Use the zip ties to fasten in the rope light. Wrap them tightly around your frame and lights in several (6-8) places.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 4:</em></strong> Cut off the tails of the zip ties.</p>
<p>This is your ring light. Continue to step 5 if you want it to have a stand (you might just want to clip it up somewhere).</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 5:</em></strong> Fasten your ring light tightly to your paper towel stand securely with several zip ties. Make sure to fasten it at the bottom (where the excess rope light is coming out of your ring light). Cut off the tails of the zip ties.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Write an outline.</em></strong> You might even want to write yourself a transcript. Having a concrete plan before you start recording will help ensure your tutorial is useful for viewers. You’ll realize where you might need to slow down and show a particular step in more detail, or where your viewers might find a particular step tricky, in a way you want if you just jump into a makeup routine you know perfectly.</li>
<li><strong><em>Layout your supplies.</em></strong> Make sure everything you need for your tutorial is laid out neatly in front of you so you can access it all easily. Try to use clean brushes – it just looks nicer.</li>
<li><strong><em>Tidy up.</em></strong> If you want your viewers to trust you when it comes to aesthetics, it’s important that your studio area is clean and tidy. You may even want to use a backdrop.</li>
<li><strong><em>Do a video test.</em></strong> Before you start your video for real, start recording and shoot some test footage. Watch that back to make sure you like the look of your frame, your face is never blurry, and you’re happy with the overall look of things.</li>
<li><strong><em>Do an audio test.</em></strong> If you’re going to be talking in your video instead of recording a voiceover after, do an audio test to make sure your audience will be able to hear you clearly.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording</strong></h2><p>Here are some things to keep in mind while you record your makeup tutorial:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Show what you’re using.</em></strong> When you use a product, brush, or any other beauty supply make sure to let your audience know what you’re using and why you chose it. This isn’t about promoting brands, it’s about making it easy for viewers to duplicate your results.<br>If you’re using autofocus, you can hold products up to the screen and wait for it to kick in. If you’re not using autofocus, just hold them up next to you for a moment. You can also shoot separate closeups of each product and cut them into your main tutorial video.</li>
<li><strong><em>Highlight small details.</em></strong> Describe what you’re doing in a lot of detail and don’t gloss over anything. Assume the person watching your tutorial doesn’t know anything about putting on makeup.</li>
<li><strong><em>Take stills for your thumbnail.</em></strong> Remember to take some still photos of your finished makeup to use in your YouTube thumbnail.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve finished recording and put away all your camera gear, there’s still work to do. You still need to edit your video and post it on YouTube. Here are some tips for that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Add transitions and effects.</em></strong> If you have several clips or even just distinct sections of your main clip, then adding transitions can be a great way to hold your viewers’ attention.<br>If you spend a lot of time on a repetitive step, you may want to speed that part up and make it a time-lapse.</li>
<li><strong><em>Add your intro.</em></strong> Having a short (usually around 5 seconds) intro sequence is a great way to strengthen your personal lifestyle brand. You can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.filmora.io/free-resources.html" >download free intros right here on filmora.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Title your video.</em></strong> Make sure your most important keyword – the type of look you’re creating, or a product you’re reviewing – is near the beginning of your video’s title. Searching for the topic of your video and writing a title similar to the highest-ranking results is a good way to start.<br>Remember to include what type of video you made, i.e. ‘tutorial’, ‘review’, or ‘get ready with me’, in your title. People might include these kinds of words in their search queries and, even if they find your video another way, they’ll probably want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</li>
<li><strong><em>Customize your thumbnail.</em></strong> Again, search for your video’s topic and see what comes up. You want your thumbnail to look related to the top results, but you also want it to jump out at potential viewers. There may be something you can add to the thumbnail photos you took that will help you stand out, like a bright border, an emoji, or a closeup of a product you feature in the video.</li>
<li><strong><em>Write a detailed description.</em></strong> Putting the products you use in your video description will help your viewers, and it’s a great place to include affiliate links if you ever join an affiliate program (like Amazon’s) to generate some revenue.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Is-There-an-Audience-for-This-Niche"><a href="#Is-There-an-Audience-for-This-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Is There an Audience for This Niche?"></a>Is There an Audience for This Niche?</h2><p>If you’re ready to start hunting down your niche, there are a few ways to go about it. You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p>
<p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance. For example, if you’re keen to do cooking tutorials but spent a year traveling Asia, why not do Asian-inspired cooking? Or if you have a passion for fashion but work as a recruitment consultant, why not offer content about dressing for work and interviews?</p>
<p>This sweet spot where your passion and talents meet with your video genre is where you’ll find your ultimate niche lurking.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?"></a>Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?</h2><p>Finding a niche is all about giving your viewers what they want to see. Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p>
<p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p>
<p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p>
<h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p>
<p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p>

<li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p>
<p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p>

<p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p>
<p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist. For example, if you narrow down your makeup search for ‘makeup tutorial for Asian male’, the results are in the region of 496k videos, a good deal less than the high-level outcome. If this was your passion, your talent and you could make great videos about it, you stand a good chance of breaking into this niche relatively easily.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What will you do differently to other channels?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With so much content out there to view, you’re not going to make your millions on YouTube if you’re boring. Viewers know that fun, quality content is out there, and will seek to find someone better than you if you’re too ‘run of the mill’ for their taste. People come to YouTube for information, but stick around for personality, so inject some of yours into everything you do.</p>
<p>There are loads of ways you can bring excitement and engagement to your YouTube channel. Think about the way you look, the way you talk, how your introduction is made, the effects used in your video, the overall concept, the direction of the camera work… the possibilities for making unique and exciting videos are pretty much limitless, but you’ll need to get creative if you want to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can you make money in this niche?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of people start YouTube channels with big dreams of making millions from their work. However, if you’re in the wrong niche to start with, you could fall flat on your face before you even start. Researching whether it’s possible to monetize your YouTube niche is crucial; here’s how to find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will a company be likely to sponsor you to use their products?</li>
<li>Can you create a ‘side business’ alongside your channel?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sponsorship can be super lucrative, but very difficult to secure. Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal. The important thing is that you need to have a plan from the start.</p>
<p>Check out the most profitable niches for monetizing your YouTube channel below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can you generate enough content in this niche?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How many topics can you think of to make videos about for your channel? If you can’t think of at least 10 off the top of your head, that’s not a good sign. You’re going to need lots of ideas and inspiration for your YouTube videos, and if you’re already struggling to think of things to do, imagine how much you’ll be struggling two, three or four years down the line.</p>
<p>You need to absolutely love and be inspired by your niche because chances are you’ll be making videos on this topic for many years to come. Are you completely sure that you’ll be as enthusiastic about this topic next year? Will your passion for the content stand the test of time? Try to project how your life will change over the coming years and whether your niche will be suited to you as time goes on.</p>
<h2 id="Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches"><a href="#Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches" class="headerlink" title="Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]"></a>Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]</h2><p>There are some YouTube niches that are easier to monetize than others. That’s not to say you should restrict yourself to only these niches, but if you’re stuck for inspiration, you’ll find these focused areas are a good place to start your search.</p>
<p><strong>#1 Makeup</strong></p>
<p>By far and away one of the most popular YouTube niches, makeup can be a great place to start. Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p>
<p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p>
<p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p>
<p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p>
<p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p>
<p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p>
<p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p>
<p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p>
<p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p>
<p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p>
<p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p>
<p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p>
<p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p>
<p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p>
<p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p>
<p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p>
<p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p>
<p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p>
<p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p>
<p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p>
<p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche. They tend to be highly immersed in the YouTube community, disclosing personal information about themselves and sharing their interests with their audience.</p>

<h2 id="Is-There-an-Audience-for-This-Niche-1"><a href="#Is-There-an-Audience-for-This-Niche-1" class="headerlink" title="Is There an Audience for This Niche?"></a>Is There an Audience for This Niche?</h2><p>If you’re ready to start hunting down your niche, there are a few ways to go about it. You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p>
<p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance. For example, if you’re keen to do cooking tutorials but spent a year traveling Asia, why not do Asian-inspired cooking? Or if you have a passion for fashion but work as a recruitment consultant, why not offer content about dressing for work and interviews?</p>
<p>This sweet spot where your passion and talents meet with your video genre is where you’ll find your ultimate niche lurking.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche-1"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?"></a>Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?</h2><p>Finding a niche is all about giving your viewers what they want to see. Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p>
<p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p>
<p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p>
<h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-1"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-1" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p>
<p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p>

<p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p>
<p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p>
<p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p>
<p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p>
<p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p>
<p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p>
<p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p>
<p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p>
<p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p>
<p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p>
<p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p>
<p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p>
<p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p>
<p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche. They tend to be highly immersed in the YouTube community, disclosing personal information about themselves and sharing their interests with their audience.</p>

<h2 id="Is-There-an-Audience-for-This-Niche-2"><a href="#Is-There-an-Audience-for-This-Niche-2" class="headerlink" title="Is There an Audience for This Niche?"></a>Is There an Audience for This Niche?</h2><p>If you’re ready to start hunting down your niche, there are a few ways to go about it. You could start by listing your hobbies and looking for trends with those, or by thinking about what types of videos you like to make the most. How could what you do for a living inspire your channel or your knowledge of a particular topic?</p>
<p>The key is to discover where you can bring something unique or interesting to YouTube, hopefully by combining your passions, hobbies, and knowledge into one big ball of brilliance. For example, if you’re keen to do cooking tutorials but spent a year traveling Asia, why not do Asian-inspired cooking? Or if you have a passion for fashion but work as a recruitment consultant, why not offer content about dressing for work and interviews?</p>
<p>This sweet spot where your passion and talents meet with your video genre is where you’ll find your ultimate niche lurking.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche-2"><a href="#Why-Is-It-Important-to-Find-Your-Niche-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?"></a>Why Is It Important to Find Your Niche?</h2><p>Finding a niche is all about giving your viewers what they want to see. Imagine you travel and upload vlogs about your travels every day. Almost all of your content is about travel, but then one day, randomly, you upload a video about cooking food. Your video was popular, you got more than 30k views, but only five people subscribed to your channel; why?</p>
<p>The answer is simple. If those who viewed the cooking video considered subscribing, they would have clicked onto your channel and seen that none of your other videos were about this topic. Despite uploading a good video, you seemed irrelevant to them, so they didn’t bother.</p>
<p>From the point of view of your subscribers, they want to know what you’re all about. They need to feel confident that, when they subscribe to you, they’ll be getting lots of quality content about the things they are most interested in. Having a clear and focused niche will allow you to do this for them.</p>
<h2 id="Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-2"><a href="#Narrowing-Down-Your-YouTube-Niche-2" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche"></a>Narrowing Down Your YouTube Niche</h2><p>The smaller and more specific your focus, the easier you’ll find it to get and hold onto subscribers. For example, if you’re niche is about dog training, why not focus on even more about doing it about training pugs? If you’re doing a parenting vlog, make it more specific by doing a parenting vlog for mums of boys, or twins, or toddlers.</p>
<p>By narrowing down your focus, your audience will be much easier to market to and to appeal to. When someone from your target audience finds your channel, they’re going to think ‘wow, this is just what I’ve been looking for’, and they’ll watch, like, share and interact with your videos way more than someone who is just a little bit interested.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-2"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]"></a>How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]</h2><p>If you’re still at a loss of how to identify the best niche for your YouTube channel, let us help. Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p>
<p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p>
<p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist. For example, if you narrow down your makeup search for ‘makeup tutorial for Asian male’, the results are in the region of 496k videos, a good deal less than the high-level outcome. If this was your passion, your talent and you could make great videos about it, you stand a good chance of breaking into this niche relatively easily.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-2.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What will you do differently to other channels?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With so much content out there to view, you’re not going to make your millions on YouTube if you’re boring. Viewers know that fun, quality content is out there, and will seek to find someone better than you if you’re too ‘run of the mill’ for their taste. People come to YouTube for information, but stick around for personality, so inject some of yours into everything you do.</p>
<p>There are loads of ways you can bring excitement and engagement to your YouTube channel. Think about the way you look, the way you talk, how your introduction is made, the effects used in your video, the overall concept, the direction of the camera work… the possibilities for making unique and exciting videos are pretty much limitless, but you’ll need to get creative if you want to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can you make money in this niche?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of people start YouTube channels with big dreams of making millions from their work. However, if you’re in the wrong niche to start with, you could fall flat on your face before you even start. Researching whether it’s possible to monetize your YouTube niche is crucial; here’s how to find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will a company be likely to sponsor you to use their products?</li>
<li>Can you create a ‘side business’ alongside your channel?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sponsorship can be super lucrative, but very difficult to secure. Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal. The important thing is that you need to have a plan from the start.</p>
<p>Check out the most profitable niches for monetizing your YouTube channel below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can you generate enough content in this niche?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How many topics can you think of to make videos about for your channel? If you can’t think of at least 10 off the top of your head, that’s not a good sign. You’re going to need lots of ideas and inspiration for your YouTube videos, and if you’re already struggling to think of things to do, imagine how much you’ll be struggling two, three or four years down the line.</p>
<p>You need to absolutely love and be inspired by your niche because chances are you’ll be making videos on this topic for many years to come. Are you completely sure that you’ll be as enthusiastic about this topic next year? Will your passion for the content stand the test of time? Try to project how your life will change over the coming years and whether your niche will be suited to you as time goes on.</p>

That’s not to say you should restrict yourself to only these niches, but if you’re stuck for inspiration, you’ll find these focused areas are a good place to start your search.</p>
<p><strong>#1 Makeup</strong></p>
<p>By far and away one of the most popular YouTube niches, makeup can be a great place to start. Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p>
<p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p>
<p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p>
<p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p>
<p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p>
<p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p>
<p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p>
<p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p>

<p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p>
<p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p>
<p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p>
<p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p>

<h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-3"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Niche-5-Tips-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]"></a>How to Find Your Niche [5 Tips]</h2><p>If you’re still at a loss of how to identify the best niche for your YouTube channel, let us help. Here are some key things to think about when looking for your niche which will help you get where you need to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are you good at? What are you passionate about?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Make a list of things you’re good at. Don’t be modest now, this isn’t the time. Think about what other people would ask for your help with, and what you’re most confident with. Getting to grips with what you have a talent for is a great place to start.</p>
<p>An example of this is PONY Syndrome, a makeup artist renowned for her Taylor Swift transformation. She found that people would often come to her for makeup advice, so she started making videos of her techniques. Fast forward a couple of years and she’s got four million subscribers and a profitable YouTube channel.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You might not think you’re an ‘expert’ in an area, but often it’s the interesting combination of your talents and passions that makes you unique. Coach Tulin is a wonderful lady who is of a plus size but who is also passionate about fitness. She’s made a popular channel that demonstrates how to modify popular exercises to make them accessible for plus-size people, as well as showing just how to fit plus-size people can be! Her fan base is smaller, at 89k subscribers, but she’s still a big influencer in her field.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/coach-tulin.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p>Subscribers who get help from you are more likely to come back to you time and again. Although we all have a good laugh watching cat videos and other entertaining clips, the YouTube channels that tend to make the most money are those which genuinely help people.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is there an audience for your potential niche?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve got an idea about your potential niche, you’ll need to make sure there are actually people out there who want to watch it. To test this out, think about a video you could make for your niche and try looking it up on YouTube. If there are a ton of results, your niche is probably not focused enough. If there are zero results, probably nobody is looking for that type of video.</p>
<p>You’re looking for somewhere in between the two extremes. If a couple of well-established channels have made a video or two on your topic, but haven’t really focused on it, you can be confident that there is an audience out there but not too much competition. You could also look for something that there are a lot of blog posts or websites about and be the first to migrate the content to YouTube.</p>
<p>For example, if you were to search ‘makeup tutorial’, you’ll find around 23 million results. Most of these are from established influencers who have already pretty much cornered the market, so getting a foot in the door as a new YouTuber here is going to be tough. That’s not to say you shouldn’t do it, but you’ll have to work hard to make your channel stand out. Be original, put your own spin on the genre and you’ll get there eventually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-1.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p>If you were to start drilling down into that niche, you’ll start to see where the opportunities exist. For example, if you narrow down your makeup search for ‘makeup tutorial for Asian male’, the results are in the region of 496k videos, a good deal less than the high-level outcome. If this was your passion, your talent and you could make great videos about it, you stand a good chance of breaking into this niche relatively easily.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-niche-2.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What will you do differently to other channels?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With so much content out there to view, you’re not going to make your millions on YouTube if you’re boring. Viewers know that fun, quality content is out there, and will seek to find someone better than you if you’re too ‘run of the mill’ for their taste. People come to YouTube for information, but stick around for personality, so inject some of yours into everything you do.</p>
<p>There are loads of ways you can bring excitement and engagement to your YouTube channel. Think about the way you look, the way you talk, how your introduction is made, the effects used in your video, the overall concept, the direction of the camera work… the possibilities for making unique and exciting videos are pretty much limitless, but you’ll need to get creative if you want to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can you make money in this niche?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of people start YouTube channels with big dreams of making millions from their work. However, if you’re in the wrong niche to start with, you could fall flat on your face before you even start. Researching whether it’s possible to monetize your YouTube niche is crucial; here’s how to find out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will a company be likely to sponsor you to use their products?</li>
<li>Can you create a ‘side business’ alongside your channel?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sponsorship can be super lucrative, but very difficult to secure. Is there a company out there that has products you could use in your videos? If so, do they already have preferred YouTubers that they sponsor? As for a side business, you could look to doing anything from offering one-to-one consultancy to selling products via Amazon on an affiliate deal. The important thing is that you need to have a plan from the start.</p>
<p>Check out the most profitable niches for monetizing your YouTube channel below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can you generate enough content in this niche?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How many topics can you think of to make videos about for your channel? If you can’t think of at least 10 off the top of your head, that’s not a good sign. You’re going to need lots of ideas and inspiration for your YouTube videos, and if you’re already struggling to think of things to do, imagine how much you’ll be struggling two, three or four years down the line.</p>
<p>You need to absolutely love and be inspired by your niche because chances are you’ll be making videos on this topic for many years to come. Are you completely sure that you’ll be as enthusiastic about this topic next year? Will your passion for the content stand the test of time? Try to project how your life will change over the coming years and whether your niche will be suited to you as time goes on.</p>
<h2 id="Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches-3"><a href="#Best-14-Trending-Niches-on-YouTube-High-CPM-Niches-3" class="headerlink" title="Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]"></a>Best 14 Trending Niches on YouTube [High CPM Niches]</h2><p>There are some YouTube niches that are easier to monetize than others. That’s not to say you should restrict yourself to only these niches, but if you’re stuck for inspiration, you’ll find these focused areas are a good place to start your search.</p>
<p><strong>#1 Makeup</strong></p>
<p>By far and away one of the most popular YouTube niches, makeup can be a great place to start. Although you’ll find lots of competition here, there is a massive audience too.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Gaming</strong></p>
<p>Gaming YouTubers are probably the most well-known; who hasn’t heard of PewDiePie? And they’re making money doing the thing they love most: gaming. It’s tough to stand out in this crowded niche, but if you can be fresh and different, you could start building your own fan base.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Food</strong></p>
<p>If you love to cook (or even just to eat!) food channels can be fab. Showing off recipes is a tried and tested moneymaker, as is showing how to use gadgets and tools in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>#4 Tech review</strong></p>
<p>We’re all using technology at home, at work, and in our pockets, and want to know that we’re buying the right stuff and using it the right way. People are hungry for this type of content, whether it’s apps and software or physical hardware.</p>
<p><strong>#5 Travel</strong></p>
<p>Travel channels have some of the sexiest content on the web, and people love to see what the world is like out there. Invest in a good action camera and find an angle to the places your visit, such as the best places to eat, hidden gems, etc.</p>
<p><strong>#6 Fashion</strong></p>
<p>Fashion can be great for YouTube, from reviewing clothing items to keeping your audience updated on the latest trends. It’s a great niche for getting sponsors and earning from affiliate marketing too.</p>
<p><strong>#7 Sports</strong></p>
<p>You’ll never run out of content if you’re busy keeping people up to date with their favorite sports teams. Just be careful not to show copyrighted material as you could find your hard work being taken down.</p>
<p><strong>#8 Animals</strong></p>
<p>It was cat video’s that birthed the notion of a viral video, and even today hilarious animal clips can garner a huge audience. As well as animals doing funny things, you could also make videos about animal care, training, and reviews of pet products.</p>
<p><strong>#9 Photography</strong></p>
<p>Thousands of budding photographers look to YouTube for good advice on how to take better shots. Photography channels can also review equipment and can benefit from affiliate links for these.</p>
<p><strong>#10 Movies</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a movie buff, why not take your opinions of the big screen to the small (and often tiny) screen? Post reviews, do top tens, or even create parodies of movies yourself. Just watch out for that copyright issue again.</p>
<p><strong>#11 How-to tutorials</strong></p>
<p>Everyone needs to know something in their life, whether it’s how to tie their shoelaces or how to change a spark plug on a car. Answering these ‘how to…’ questions could get you ranking highly and gathering millions of views.</p>
<p><strong># 12 Music</strong></p>
<p>You have to be careful when doing a music channel, as you’re unlikely to get permission to play actual tracks. However, you could do commentaries on music news, give advice on instrument care or even teach people how to play. If you’re a musician yourself, this is a great way to get more exposure for your band.</p>
<p><strong>#13 ASMR</strong></p>
<p>One of the fastest-growing niches on YouTube, ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response to give it its full name, is all about the experience. Using soothing sounds and imagery to relax viewers, ASMR YouTubers look to create a physical response in the viewer to something happening in the video.</p>
<p><strong>#14 Lifestyle</strong></p>
<p>Lifestyle vloggers are those who don’t really fit into a particular niche. They tend to be highly immersed in the YouTube community, disclosing personal information about themselves and sharing their interests with their audience.</p>
