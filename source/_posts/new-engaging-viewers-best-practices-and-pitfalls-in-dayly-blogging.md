If you are making videos on YouTube, you’ll have come to a point where you feel daring enough to take on the ultimate challenge: daily vlogging.

You might have been inspired by other creators on YouTube or you might have heard of VEDA: Vlog every day April (or August). You might have also watched some videos from influencers telling you that the ruthless YouTube algorithm demands daily content if you aspire to grow an audience.

There are many reasons why you may want to try your hand at becoming a daily vlogger, but here are 3 motivating reasons to [conquer your vlogging fears](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and get started.

## **Why Daily Vlog Anyways?**

 **Build discipline**: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.

**Practice more**: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.

**Please the YouTube algorithm**: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as [view velocity](https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw). YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.

Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?

## **The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging**

#### **1\. Do Get Some Experience First**

If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.

#### **2\. Don’t Film Everything**

Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.

#### **3\. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)**

Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.

Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).

#### **4\. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video**

The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.

#### **5\. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts**

Any chance you have to cut down on your editing time, use it. This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are [Filmora’s hotkeys](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### **6\. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content**

Staying organized is so important, especially as you begin to accumulate more and more footage. It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…

#### **7\. Do Have A Goal**

Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.

#### **8\. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)**

You’ve heard it before: you don’t need anything fancy to be a vlogger. If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful [YouTube gear starter guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.

The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.

#### **9\. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere**

Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.

#### **10\. Don’t Neglect Your Health**

Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?

#### **11\. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers**

By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.

#### **12\. Don’t Forget About Your Audience**

Remember that in the end, you are creating videos for someone else to enjoy. Even though you might be doing the daily vlog for yourself, if you want your viewers to return every day, you have to have an overall mission for your project. Is your message one that is aimed to motivate or do you want to document a journey? Don’t create your content in a vacuum, ask your viewers for feedback so you know how to improve.
  
Embarking on your daily vlogging adventure is not one to take lightly, but after 1 month, 1 season, or 1 year, you will be able to look back and see all that you have accomplished and feel proud. With the advice from this article, you can properly prepare yourself and enjoy each step of the process. Don’t overthink it, have fun!

## **Why Daily Vlog Anyways?**

 **Build discipline**: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.

**Practice more**: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.

**Please the YouTube algorithm**: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as [view velocity](https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw). YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.

Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?

## **The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging**

#### **1\. Do Get Some Experience First**

If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.

#### **2\. Don’t Film Everything**

Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.

#### **3\. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)**

Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.

Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).

#### **4\. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video**

The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.

#### **5\. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts**

Any chance you have to cut down on your editing time, use it. This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are [Filmora’s hotkeys](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### **6\. Don’t Forget to Label Your Content**

Staying organized is so important, especially as you begin to accumulate more and more footage. It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…

#### **7\. Do Have A Goal**

Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.

#### **8\. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)**

You’ve heard it before: you don’t need anything fancy to be a vlogger. If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful [YouTube gear starter guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.

The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.

#### **9\. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere**

Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.

#### **10\. Don’t Neglect Your Health**

Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?

#### **11\. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers**

By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.

#### **12\. Don’t Forget About Your Audience**

Remember that in the end, you are creating videos for someone else to enjoy. Even though you might be doing the daily vlog for yourself, if you want your viewers to return every day, you have to have an overall mission for your project. Is your message one that is aimed to motivate or do you want to document a journey? Don’t create your content in a vacuum, ask your viewers for feedback so you know how to improve.
  
Embarking on your daily vlogging adventure is not one to take lightly, but after 1 month, 1 season, or 1 year, you will be able to look back and see all that you have accomplished and feel proud. With the advice from this article, you can properly prepare yourself and enjoy each step of the process. Don’t overthink it, have fun!

**Unboxing videos** are a bizarre trend. However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.

And, if you haven't already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like. At its core, "unboxing" is the procedure of recording the moment when a particular product is removed and opened from the packaging sold in.

Again, you're probably thinking:

'Why would anybody gaze at other folks opening their product packaging?'

More than 90,000 people type 'unboxing' into YouTube each month, and that's quite interesting as well as strange. Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.

In this article, you'll see the science behind such unboxing videos and learn how to create an attractive one by taking inspiration from others.

So whether you're not sure why we admire unboxing videos or you wish to know how to use them to your benefit, you're in the right place!

02 [5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels](#part2)

03 [How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video](#part3)

04 [FAQs about Unboxing Videos](#part4)

## **Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?**

Within the unboxing videos, people open boxes and narrate their actions. Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.

Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don't generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.

## **Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels**

There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.

Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber's unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness. So which is the perfect or ideal YouTube channel for unboxing videos for you to try to get featured on? The answer is: “It depends!”

Not every YouTuber is the best for every eCommerce business—and a YouTube channel simply being huge and influential doesn’t make it relevant for your brand. So it's essential to consider brand suitability while trying looking for a YouTuber to create unboxing videos.

This means considering whether they use harsh language or if their target audience has some overlap with your target audience.

Keeping it in mind, here are some of the top YouTube unboxing channels for inspiration:

### 1. [Unbox Therapy](https://www.youtube.com/c/unboxtherapy/videos)

![unbox therapy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/unbox-therapy.jpg)

### 2. [Ryan's World](https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanToysReview/featured)

### 3. [Tech Unboxing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp3T5fUUJootTrVwGDdY6pw/videos)

![tech unboxing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tech-unboxing-video.jpg)

### 5. [UNBOXING Fashion & Sports](https://www.youtube.com/c/UNBOXINGFashionSports/videos)

![unboxing fashion sports](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/unboxing-fashion-sports.jpg)

Unboxing Fashion & Sports is a channel specializing in well unboxing videos for a range of sports and fashion apparel (frequently shoe brands like Nike or Adidas). Its content generally features a close-up of the reviewer taking products out of the box and moving them around. At the same time, text highlights relevant product features—all set to catchy music without being disturbing. With 17k plus subscribers and a strong focus on sports apparel, this YouTuber knows how to attract a target market.

## **Part 3: How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video**

Firstly, you have to take note of the following points to create the best unboxing videos.

1\. Select an Unboxing Niche

2\. Practice Speaking Clearly and Slowly

3\. Use the Best Unboxing Set-Up

4\. Make Sure to Timely Unbox the Products

5\. Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video

6\. Show the Product in Use

One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.

Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?

Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:

### 1. Use a Good Camera & Video Editing Software

While you probably don't require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.

In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don't have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you're filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.

On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can't do with this software! It's a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.

The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that's extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.

![filmorax boxpng ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png)

### 2. Prepare Your Stage/Photo Lightbox

If you look at some famous unboxing channels listed above, you'll notice that much of their content is shot in a well-framed space where there isn't much in the background to disturb them from the product being viewed.

Often, this is a "photo lightbox" or an empty table (a small container with a smooth white backdrop that enhances lighting while reducing shadows for making photos look greater). Lightboxes can also be helpful when you're taking snapshots of your products to put up on your eCommerce website, so it's a great idea to make (or buy) one that can fit your products.

### 3. Practice Making Videos

Before uploading videos to YouTube, take some time to practice making your unboxing videos using random items or already-opened products. This way, you can work upon setting up your stage and camera, keeping the product within an aim, narrating your unboxing video, editing footage to reduce the "dead air" where nothing is being done or said, and more!

When you're over making your first test video, play it back and look for issues like excessive "ums, ahs," or things that are out of focus and other sentence fillers. Don't worry if your first video isn't that great—that's what practice (and your video editing software) are for!

### 4. Don't Waste Your Viewers' Time

If you want to make the best unboxing videos, ensure that you get to the “unboxing” section quite instantly! As indicated by the Expert Voice: "remember that you compete for viewers' attention with lots of other video content. Keep your introductions brief and quickly get to the unboxing." If you take too much time to get to the section of unboxing video, you risk losing your audience’s interest and them going away from your content before you can introduce your product.

### 5. Compile Things Up Once in a While

If you unbox your products, you might instantly run out of content ideas to make. You may look up your YouTube channel losing traction without the new content. So, try to compile things up once in a while—as the Ryan's World channel discussed earlier.

Creating other kinds of content, such as how-to videos and advice videos for specific products, product updates, and simple news, or even short promotional bits, can help keep your publishing frequency top-notch.

Just remember: everything you publish or post should still be related to your brand and your channel's core content!

### 6. Promote Your YouTube Video or Channel on Social Media

There are specific odds that your eCommerce business is active on other social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Taking benefit of your audience on other social media platforms to promote your YouTube channel can assist you promptly earning some easy subscribers and allow you better promote your products for the current followers.

## **Part 4: FAQs about Unboxing Videos**

**1 - What should be included in the unboxing video?**

As discussed earlier, you can include products related to your channel’s niche in your unboxing videos.

**2 - How long should an unboxing video be?**

Time will vary depending on the actual unboxing product, but try to keep it below 5 minutes.

**3 - Can you monetize unboxing videos?**

No. Text-based commentary isn't acceptable for monetization. It must be vocal, and for you to show your face as well would be even better.

### Conclusion

Unboxing videos are a bang on that; hate them or love them, they are here to stay. Whether you're a brand owner, a consumer, or both, you've probably considered one or two while purposelessly browsing.

You can use the above tips or strategies to create a compelling unboxing experience for small brands to get the most out of a best unboxing video.

### 4. Don't Waste Your Viewers' Time

If you want to make the best unboxing videos, ensure that you get to the “unboxing” section quite instantly! As indicated by the Expert Voice: "remember that you compete for viewers' attention with lots of other video content. Keep your introductions brief and quickly get to the unboxing." If you take too much time to get to the section of unboxing video, you risk losing your audience’s interest and them going away from your content before you can introduce your product.

### 5. Compile Things Up Once in a While

If you unbox your products, you might instantly run out of content ideas to make. You may look up your YouTube channel losing traction without the new content. So, try to compile things up once in a while—as the Ryan's World channel discussed earlier.

Creating other kinds of content, such as how-to videos and advice videos for specific products, product updates, and simple news, or even short promotional bits, can help keep your publishing frequency top-notch.

Just remember: everything you publish or post should still be related to your brand and your channel's core content!

### 6. Promote Your YouTube Video or Channel on Social Media

There are specific odds that your eCommerce business is active on other social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Taking benefit of your audience on other social media platforms to promote your YouTube channel can assist you promptly earning some easy subscribers and allow you better promote your products for the current followers.

## **Part 4: FAQs about Unboxing Videos**

**1 - What should be included in the unboxing video?**

As discussed earlier, you can include products related to your channel’s niche in your unboxing videos.

**2 - How long should an unboxing video be?**

Time will vary depending on the actual unboxing product, but try to keep it below 5 minutes.

**3 - Can you monetize unboxing videos?**

No. Text-based commentary isn't acceptable for monetization. It must be vocal, and for you to show your face as well would be even better.

### Conclusion

Unboxing videos are a bang on that; hate them or love them, they are here to stay. Whether you're a brand owner, a consumer, or both, you've probably considered one or two while purposelessly browsing.

You can use the above tips or strategies to create a compelling unboxing experience for small brands to get the most out of a best unboxing video.

**Unboxing videos** are a bizarre trend. However, these videos are getting the highest traction, and more videos are getting onboard about various products.

And, if you haven't already checked one, an unboxing video is what it sounds like. At its core, "unboxing" is the procedure of recording the moment when a particular product is removed and opened from the packaging sold in.

Again, you're probably thinking:

'Why would anybody gaze at other folks opening their product packaging?'

More than 90,000 people type 'unboxing' into YouTube each month, and that's quite interesting as well as strange. Also, these are just a few of the insane statistics about the eCommerce trend of unboxing videos.

In this article, you'll see the science behind such unboxing videos and learn how to create an attractive one by taking inspiration from others.

So whether you're not sure why we admire unboxing videos or you wish to know how to use them to your benefit, you're in the right place!

04 [FAQs about Unboxing Videos](#part4)

## **Part 1: What is an Unboxing Video?**

Within the unboxing videos, people open boxes and narrate their actions. Unboxing videos are incredibly famous with kids, grabbing up tons of millions of subscribers as well as millions of views. Such videos are also usually great for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the matter of the subject of some unboxing videos is not age-appropriate. And, there are niche-specific videos as well on different channels.

Are unboxers paid by the companies whose services or products they consider opening on YouTube? Companies don't generally pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their products in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with subscribers and tens of millions of views), companies may send the products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. However, companies do sponsor highly famous and influential YouTubers in other areas. For instance, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or convention.

## **Part 2: 5 Best YouTube Unboxing Channels**

There are considerable merits to offering your customers a branded and personalized unboxing experience.

Even if you decide to get your products featured in a YouTuber's unboxing videos, you can help promote your brand and improve brand awareness. So which is the perfect or ideal YouTube channel for unboxing videos for you to try to get featured on? The answer is: “It depends!”

Not every YouTuber is the best for every eCommerce business—and a YouTube channel simply being huge and influential doesn’t make it relevant for your brand. So it's essential to consider brand suitability while trying looking for a YouTuber to create unboxing videos.

This means considering whether they use harsh language or if their target audience has some overlap with your target audience.

Keeping it in mind, here are some of the top YouTube unboxing channels for inspiration:

### 1. [Unbox Therapy](https://www.youtube.com/c/unboxtherapy/videos)

![unbox therapy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/unbox-therapy.jpg)

### 2. [Ryan's World](https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanToysReview/featured)

![unboxing world ryans world](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/unboxing-video-ryans-world.jpg)

This channel features fun animation and unboxing videos, simple science experiments for kids, and other educational content. Those interested in doing the best unboxing videos for a younger audience could learn a lot from this platform.

### 3. [Tech Unboxing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp3T5fUUJootTrVwGDdY6pw/videos)

![tech unboxing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tech-unboxing-video.jpg)

At 700k plus subscribers, Tech Unboxing may not be the most significant content creator on this list, but it's no slouch. The channel mentions everything about the high-tech gadgets and isn't afraid to brag about the products reviewed. The track also hosts frequent giveaways of tech products and unboxing videos that the host likes that other tech enthusiasts may look at it with fun.

### 4. [Dr. DeBox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHOMwu9rsESLsDNSB8XgCUw)

### 5. [UNBOXING Fashion & Sports](https://www.youtube.com/c/UNBOXINGFashionSports/videos)

![unboxing fashion sports](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/unboxing-fashion-sports.jpg)

Unboxing Fashion & Sports is a channel specializing in well unboxing videos for a range of sports and fashion apparel (frequently shoe brands like Nike or Adidas). Its content generally features a close-up of the reviewer taking products out of the box and moving them around. At the same time, text highlights relevant product features—all set to catchy music without being disturbing. With 17k plus subscribers and a strong focus on sports apparel, this YouTuber knows how to attract a target market.

## **Part 3: How to Create a Killer Unboxing Video**

Firstly, you have to take note of the following points to create the best unboxing videos.

1\. Select an Unboxing Niche

2\. Practice Speaking Clearly and Slowly

3\. Use the Best Unboxing Set-Up

4\. Make Sure to Timely Unbox the Products

5\. Don’t Delay the Unboxing in Your Video

6\. Show the Product in Use

One of the prominent factors about unboxing videos is that anyone can make them. You don’t need to be uniquely talented but go with the products that have broad appeal. Once you create such videos, you can share them on your social media networks or personal website.

Do you want to create your creative unboxing videos for others to find? Do you like to introduce your customers to your products in your own YouTube Channel, so you have total control over the content and messaging of each video?

Here is a step by step guide to help you revamp the creation of your unboxing video:

### 1. Use a Good Camera & Video Editing Software

While you probably don't require that high-tech camera that professional Hollywood filmmakers would consider shooting or filming 8k+ ultra-HD movies, you need a good camera that can capture HD footage (preferably at least 1080p). This allows providing your unboxing videos just enough of a professional look to not deactivate or disable the interest of potential viewers.

In addition to a camera, ensure that you have a stand or a decent tripod for it. This way, you don't have to hold onto your camera by yourself (or have an assistant hold it) while you're filming. In addition, this minimizes camera shake, which assists in making easy-to-watch videos.

On the other hand, video editing software is a must for taking all of your video compiling and recording into a cohesive video that will be attractive for viewers to watch. There are tons of accessible video editing tools to choose from and some paid options that may have helpful features. However, our favorite pick is Wondershare Filmora due to its beginner-friendly yet professional editing elements. Let us know what you can't do with this software! It's a combination of professionalism and reliability you can consider for all your video editing needs.

The hottest feature of Wondershare Filmora for making attractive unboxing videos is audio ducking. With this feature, you can effectively lower the background vocals while adding your voiceovers. And, that's extremely valuable in making these kinds of videos.

### 2. Prepare Your Stage/Photo Lightbox

If you look at some famous unboxing channels listed above, you'll notice that much of their content is shot in a well-framed space where there isn't much in the background to disturb them from the product being viewed.

Often, this is a "photo lightbox" or an empty table (a small container with a smooth white backdrop that enhances lighting while reducing shadows for making photos look greater). Lightboxes can also be helpful when you're taking snapshots of your products to put up on your eCommerce website, so it's a great idea to make (or buy) one that can fit your products.

### 3. Practice Making Videos

Before uploading videos to YouTube, take some time to practice making your unboxing videos using random items or already-opened products. This way, you can work upon setting up your stage and camera, keeping the product within an aim, narrating your unboxing video, editing footage to reduce the "dead air" where nothing is being done or said, and more!

When you're over making your first test video, play it back and look for issues like excessive "ums, ahs," or things that are out of focus and other sentence fillers. Don't worry if your first video isn't that great—that's what practice (and your video editing software) are for!

### 4. Don't Waste Your Viewers' Time

If you want to make the best unboxing videos, ensure that you get to the “unboxing” section quite instantly! As indicated by the Expert Voice: "remember that you compete for viewers' attention with lots of other video content. Keep your introductions brief and quickly get to the unboxing."

### 6. Promote Your YouTube Video or Channel on Social Media

There are specific odds that your eCommerce business is active on other social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Taking benefit of your audience on other social media platforms to promote your YouTube channel can assist you promptly earning some easy subscribers and allow you better promote your products for the current followers.

## **Part 4: FAQs about Unboxing Videos**
