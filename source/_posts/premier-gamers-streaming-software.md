## What to look for game screen recorder

There are many people who do not have any knowledge regarding game capture software. You must look for the following things before choosing a game screen recorder.

* The option of personalizing the hotkeys
* Number of built-in tools
* How to begin and pause recording
* Number of codes offered by it
* Recording time
* Editing features like cut and paste
* Custom-made Recording Resolution
* Adjustable video frames

In addition to this, some game recorders also affect your in-game fps (Frame per second). You should also check whether it is compatible with large-sized files or not. The quality of the video also depends upon the file size. The larger is file size, the higher is video quality. However, you can face problems while uploading huge-sized videos as online content distributors hardly support such files. So you must compress your video before sharing anywhere. There are also some recorders that provide a direct link to social networking sites. Thus you should consider these factors also before purchasing the game recording software.

You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM. PC should also have two storage drives so as to install gaming software on one drive and record videos on another drive. It is also advisable to use computers than laptops for recording screen activities because laptops rarely have two storage drives.

## FAQs

### Q1\. What software do YouTubers use to record gameplay?

Most gamers on YouTube use Open Broadcast System (OBS) and Bandicam to record their gameplays. However, there are a few more authentic screen recording tools for high-quality video recording, such as Filmora.

Using Filmora to record your gameplay will help you save the video in all major video formats. Moreover, the tool is also compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems.

### Q2\. How do I record my screen smoothly?

You should do a couple of things to avoid lagging while screen recording your gameplay. For example, do not use your built-in microphone to record your voice during screen recording. Instead, use an external microphone.

Only record what is important. Use high RAM and have a good graphics card. And most importantly, get screen recorders with at least 60fps.

### Q3\. Does screen recording decrease FPS?

Yes, it does affect your overall gaming performance. However, it depends on several factors. For instance, the fps won't be affected much if you’re playing a less CPU-intensive game. The only way to sustain FPS is to have a high-quality screen recorder, such as OBS, Filmora, Bandicam, and Fraps.

## What to look for game screen recorder

There are many people who do not have any knowledge regarding game capture software. You must look for the following things before choosing a game screen recorder.

* The option of personalizing the hotkeys
* Number of built-in tools
* How to begin and pause recording
* Number of codes offered by it
* Recording time
* Editing features like cut and paste
* Custom-made Recording Resolution
* Adjustable video frames

In addition to this, some game recorders also affect your in-game fps (Frame per second). You should also check whether it is compatible with large-sized files or not. The quality of the video also depends upon the file size. The larger is file size, the higher is video quality. However, you can face problems while uploading huge-sized videos as online content distributors hardly support such files. So you must compress your video before sharing anywhere. There are also some recorders that provide a direct link to social networking sites. Thus you should consider these factors also before purchasing the game recording software.

You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM. PC should also have two storage drives so as to install gaming software on one drive and record videos on another drive. It is also advisable to use computers than laptops for recording screen activities because laptops rarely have two storage drives.

Yes, it does affect your overall gaming performance. However, it depends on several factors. For instance, the fps won't be affected much if you’re playing a less CPU-intensive game. The only way to sustain FPS is to have a high-quality screen recorder, such as OBS, Filmora, Bandicam, and Fraps.

## What to look for game screen recorder

There are many people who do not have any knowledge regarding game capture software. You must look for the following things before choosing a game screen recorder.

* The option of personalizing the hotkeys
* Number of built-in tools
* How to begin and pause recording
* Number of codes offered by it
* Recording time
* Editing features like cut and paste
* Custom-made Recording Resolution
* Adjustable video frames

In addition to this, some game recorders also affect your in-game fps (Frame per second). You should also check whether it is compatible with large-sized files or not. The quality of the video also depends upon the file size. The larger is file size, the higher is video quality. However, you can face problems while uploading huge-sized videos as online content distributors hardly support such files. So you must compress your video before sharing anywhere. There are also some recorders that provide a direct link to social networking sites. Thus you should consider these factors also before purchasing the game recording software.

You can easily run this recorder on your computer if it is updated and has 8GB of RAM. PC should also have two storage drives so as to install gaming software on one drive and record videos on another drive. It is also advisable to use computers than laptops for recording screen activities because laptops rarely have two storage drives.

## FAQs

### Q1\. What software do YouTubers use to record gameplay?

Most gamers on YouTube use Open Broadcast System (OBS) and Bandicam to record their gameplays. However, there are a few more authentic screen recording tools for high-quality video recording, such as Filmora.

Using Filmora to record your gameplay will help you save the video in all major video formats. Moreover, the tool is also compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems.

### Q2\. How do I record my screen smoothly?

You should do a couple of things to avoid lagging while screen recording your gameplay. For example, do not use your built-in microphone to record your voice during screen recording. Instead, use an external microphone.

Only record what is important. Use high RAM and have a good graphics card. And most importantly, get screen recorders with at least 60fps.

### Q3\. Does screen recording decrease FPS?

Yes, it does affect your overall gaming performance. However, it depends on several factors. For instance, the fps won't be affected much if you’re playing a less CPU-intensive game. The only way to sustain FPS is to have a high-quality screen recorder, such as OBS, Filmora, Bandicam, and Fraps.

## The Essential Guide to YouTube Video Lighting Tips

# How To Light Your YouTube Video

When it comes to sensitivity to light, no consumer-level camera sensor comes close in performance to the human eye. Many newbies to videography, though, don’t think about this when they use their camera indoors and discover that their recorded footage appears too dark.

If you want to use your camera indoors as many YouTubers do, you’ll need to have extra light. But the solution is not as simple as surrounding yourself with lamps that are all randomly placed.

Below, I’ll go into detail on how you can set up your lighting equipment to make your YouTube videos look good.

| Table of Contents [Using Light You Already Have](#USING-LIGHT-YOU-ALREADY-HAVE) [Window Lighting](#Window-Lighting)[Home Lighting](#Home-Lighting) [Home Studio Lighting](#HOME-STUDIO-LIGHTING) [Light Control](#Light-Control)[3-Point Lighting](#Three-Point-Lighting)[4-Point Lighting](#four-point-lighting) |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Part 1: Using Light You Already Have

Most beginner YouTubers light their videos with what they already have. That’s what I did to start as well. In the past, my video recording space consisted of natural sunlight coming from my window and ceiling light for times when the sunlight wasn’t strong enough.

### 1.  Window Lighting

The best thing about window lighting is that it’s free. The worst thing about it is that it’s uncontrollable. The amount of light you get in your video can vary with all the changes in the weather.

Window lighting for me was especially difficult to work with because I live in a very rainy and cloudy city, Vancouver, Canada, where we pretty much just get three months of good sun.

![  YouTube Video Lighting ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-lighting-comparison.jpg)

Above are two freeze frames from one of Daniel's past window-lit vlogs. Although these two frames are both from the same vlog, you can see that the image on the right looks brighter due to clearer skies at that moment. These varying amounts of light is what you will have to deal with if you choose to light your YouTube video with window lighting.

### 2. Home Lighting

Home lighting is another source of light that many new YouTubers use. In the past, when my window light wasn’t strong enough to light my video recording space, I would turn on the ceiling light.

![Mixed Lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-lighting-for-youtube-videos.jpg)

Notice how the color of Daniel's skin looks much more orange here (above) than the color of the skin in the two side-by-side window lighting examples? The side of the face also appears to look bluer. This all happened because he mixed up different color temperatures shining out of the two lights (cooler window light and warmer ceiling light).

Most home lighting is warmer in its color temperature. If you want to use your home lights without everything being orange-tinted, you’ll need to switch out your light bulbs for daytime LED light bulbs.

Ceiling lights are also typically situated in the center of a room in order to light an entire room evenly. This is not likely to be the best location for your filming video. Since the ceiling light was directly above the face in the above example, you can see harder shadows beneath his cheeks.

## Part 2: Home Studio Lighting

If you rather not deal with all the window and home lighting challenges, you can set up studio lighting in your home.

### 1. Light Control

The first thing you’ll want to do to set up studio lighting in your home is to pick a room to film in and eliminate as much external lighting as you can. Use blinds, curtains, towels, or any thick fabric to block sunlight from shining into your room.

### 2. 3-Point Lighting

The most common setup for studio lighting is 3-point lighting. For this kind of lighting you’ll need three lights: a key light, a fill light, and a back light (also called a hair light).

![3-Point Lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-lighting-3-point-lighting.jpg)

Out of the three lights, the key light should be the brightest. When it is positioned to the left of you (as shown in the diagram above) your right side will have shadows.

To minimize the shadows on your right side, use a weaker light as a fill light. You don’t want your fill light to completely eliminate all your shadows or else your shot will look flat.

Lastly, a backlight positioned behind you can give an appealing highlight to the ends of your head and even help to separate your hair from blending into your background if both happen to be dark.

### 3. 4-Point Lighting

As a YouTuber, you may not only want yourself to be seen optimally with proper lighting, but you may also want your background to be seen optimally, especially if you’ve taken the time to decorate it for your audience.

What you’ll need to ensure that your background is sufficiently lit is 4-point lighting setup. The 4-point lighting setup is the same as a 3-point lighting setup, but with an additional light shining at your background.

For more information on lighting equipment, check out my [Top 17 Video Lighting Equipment For YouTubers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-17-video-lighting-equipment-for-youtubers-440.html).

### Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the best video editing software for YouTube beginners to start the YouTube channel. So, if you find the lighting isn't perfect after recording, you can use the Auto Color Enhancement feature in Filmora to adjust the color with one-click. Or, you can change the white balance, Light, color, and HSL manually. Filmora also features some presets and [LUTs templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which allows you to apply pre-programmed effects to video for color correction faster.

## Part 2: Home Studio Lighting

If you rather not deal with all the window and home lighting challenges, you can set up studio lighting in your home.

### 1. Light Control

The first thing you’ll want to do to set up studio lighting in your home is to pick a room to film in and eliminate as much external lighting as you can. Use blinds, curtains, towels, or any thick fabric to block sunlight from shining into your room.

### 2. 3-Point Lighting

The most common setup for studio lighting is 3-point lighting. For this kind of lighting you’ll need three lights: a key light, a fill light, and a back light (also called a hair light).

![3-Point Lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-lighting-3-point-lighting.jpg)

Out of the three lights, the key light should be the brightest. When it is positioned to the left of you (as shown in the diagram above) your right side will have shadows.

To minimize the shadows on your right side, use a weaker light as a fill light. You don’t want your fill light to completely eliminate all your shadows or else your shot will look flat.

Lastly, a backlight positioned behind you can give an appealing highlight to the ends of your head and even help to separate your hair from blending into your background if both happen to be dark.

### 3. 4-Point Lighting

As a YouTuber, you may not only want yourself to be seen optimally with proper lighting, but you may also want your background to be seen optimally, especially if you’ve taken the time to decorate it for your audience.

What you’ll need to ensure that your background is sufficiently lit is 4-point lighting setup. The 4-point lighting setup is the same as a 3-point lighting setup, but with an additional light shining at your background.

### Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the best video editing software for YouTube beginners to start the YouTube channel. So, if you find the lighting isn't perfect after recording, you can use the Auto Color Enhancement feature in Filmora to adjust the color with one-click. Or, you can change the white balance, Light, color, and HSL manually. Filmora also features some presets and [LUTs templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which allows you to apply pre-programmed effects to video for color correction faster.

When it comes to sensitivity to light, no consumer-level camera sensor comes close in performance to the human eye. Many newbies to videography, though, don’t think about this when they use their camera indoors and discover that their recorded footage appears too dark.

If you want to use your camera indoors as many YouTubers do, you’ll need to have extra light. But the solution is not as simple as surrounding yourself with lamps that are all randomly placed.

Below, I’ll go into detail on how you can set up your lighting equipment to make your YouTube videos look good.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Part 1: Using Light You Already Have

Most beginner YouTubers light their videos with what they already have. That’s what I did to start as well. In the past, my video recording space consisted of natural sunlight coming from my window and ceiling light for times when the sunlight wasn’t strong enough.

### 1.  Window Lighting

The best thing about window lighting is that it’s free. The worst thing about it is that it’s uncontrollable. The amount of light you get in your video can vary with all the changes in the weather.

Window lighting for me was especially difficult to work with because I live in a very rainy and cloudy city, Vancouver, Canada, where we pretty much just get three months of good sun.

![  YouTube Video Lighting ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-lighting-comparison.jpg)

Above are two freeze frames from one of Daniel's past window-lit vlogs. Although these two frames are both from the same vlog, you can see that the image on the right looks brighter due to clearer skies at that moment. These varying amounts of light is what you will have to deal with if you choose to light your YouTube video with window lighting.

### 2. Home Lighting

Home lighting is another source of light that many new YouTubers use. In the past, when my window light wasn’t strong enough to light my video recording space, I would turn on the ceiling light.

![Mixed Lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-lighting-for-youtube-videos.jpg)

Notice how the color of Daniel's skin looks much more orange here (above) than the color of the skin in the two side-by-side window lighting examples? The side of the face also appears to look bluer. This all happened because he mixed up different color temperatures shining out of the two lights (cooler window light and warmer ceiling light).

Most home lighting is warmer in its color temperature. If you want to use your home lights without everything being orange-tinted, you’ll need to switch out your light bulbs for daytime LED light bulbs.

Ceiling lights are also typically situated in the center of a room in order to light an entire room evenly. This is not likely to be the best location for your filming video. Since the ceiling light was directly above the face in the above example, you can see harder shadows beneath his cheeks.
