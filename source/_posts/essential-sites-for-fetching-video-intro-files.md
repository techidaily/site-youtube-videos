There is so much content on YouTube that reaching millions of viewers can prove to be quite a challenge. The sheer amount of videos on YouTube pushes creators to upload videos that have a distinctive visual style to their channels. Adding an intro to a video you upload to YouTube can help you promote your channel, inform the audiences about new videos you’re planning to share online or briefly summarize the topic of a video. Creating an intro for a YouTube video is a time-consuming task that often requires advanced animation and video editing skills. In case you’re looking for a quick solution to this problem you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to reveal to you some of the best online destinations where you can find captivating YouTube intro templates that will make your videos stand out from the crowd.

## Top Online Platforms for Downloading YouTube Intro Templates

Video editing professionals use stock websites and online video editing platforms for a variety of reasons that range from obtaining complementary footage for their projects to discovering templates and other animation graphics. YouTube intro templates that are available on these websites are not compatible with all video editing, animation, motion graphics, and compositing software products. Here are some of the most reliable online sources that offer a wide variety of mesmerizing YouTube intro templates.

#### 1. [Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start at $9.99 per month

**Compatibility:** Filmora, After Effects

The Wondersahre’s stock footage platform offers a plethora of visual and audio effects, music, videos, and YouTube intro templates. In addition, Filmstock lets you choose from packs like Urban Opener, Dynamic Intro or Fast Pop that fit various visual styles of YouTube videos. You can use Filmostocks for free, but if you opt for this option you won’t have access to the media assets stored in the platform’s Standard Library. On the other hand, purchasing the Premium subscription plan enables you to download twenty premium assets per month and to discover new intros, effects or stock footage each day. Filmostocks is a great choice for all YouTubers who edit their videos with Filmora or other versions of this video editing software as well as Adobe After Effects.

**Compatibility:** web-based

YouTubers in need of a constant supply of fresh intros for their videos are going to love using MotionDen because this web-based video editing platform offers hundreds of customizable YouTube intro templates. You just have to select a template you like and upload your footage or use images from stock websites like Pixabay, Pexels or Unspalsh. MotionDen automates the video editing process which makes it a perfect choice for social media content creators. Even though you can make a video on this platform for free, you must pay a $9 fee to remove the watermark from it. Opting for a monthly subscription plan enables you to export all your videos in Full HD resolution and share them directly to YouTube.

#### 3. [Velosofy](https://www.velosofy.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** After Effect, Cinema 4D, Blender, Sony Vegas

Setting up an account on Velosofy will grant you access to hundreds of predesigned intro, outro or logo templates for some of the best professional video editing apps in the industry.

#### 4. [Videoblocks](https://www.videoblocks.com/collections/youtube-intros-outros)

**Price:** Subscription plans start at $8 per month

**Compatibility:** AE

This is probably one of the largest video stock websites on the Internet right now that features video categories like Nature, People or Historical and Archival. The owners of the Basic subscription plan can’t download templates for Adobe After Effects since this option is only available within the Unlimited subscription plan. If you decide to become the full-time member of the Videoblocks community you’ll be able to download quick logo intros, glitch intros as well as a wide array of different templates you can add to videos you edit in After Effects. Those of you who want to purchase intro templates directly from the artists can use the Marketplace option that offers an equally impressive selection of intros.

#### 5. [Videobolt](https://videobolt.net/welcome)

**Price:** Free trial available, prices of subscription plans are available upon request

**Compatibility:** web-based

Videobolt makes creating intros for YouTube videos look easy, as you just have to browse through the platform's collection of templates, and click Edit once you find the one that is a perfect fit for your project. Afterward, you just have to upload the media files you’d like your intro to contain. You won’t be able to use the platform’s template customization tools unless you are a registered subscriber. Videobolt is an excellent option for companies, entrepreneurs or anyone else who need an easy way to create visually impressive intros for the videos they upload to their YouTube channels.

#### 6. [Flixexpress](https://flixpress.com/AutomatedTemplates.aspx)

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $0.83 per month billed annually

**Compatibility:** web-based

Finding a perfect intro for your upcoming YouTube video won’t be much of a problem if you choose to become a member of the Flixexpress community, because the platform features thousands of automated templates that can be customized online. You must create an account on Flixexpress before you can start editing the templates, but keep in mind that the free version of the platform doesn’t allow you to import your own footage or store footage for longer than one day. Opting for any of the other available subscription plans will enable you to export your videos in 1080p resolution and have access to fifty or more templates, depending on the plan you choose.
