# How to Record your iPhone or iPad Screen for YouTube

There are a lot of reasons why you might want to use footage recorded from the screen of your apple device in your YouTube videos. Some people like to make YouTube tutorials about iPhone or iPad apps, others like to share their gaming experiences, and some need to use footage taken from their devices for presentations. Even if you do not think these kinds of videos suit your vlog, screen recording is a useful tool to have on your belt. You never know when one of your subscribers is going to ask you about your favorite mobile games.

Basically, there are three ways to record YouTube video on iPhone/iPad, including the built-in screen recorder (if you have [updated to iOS 11](https://support.apple.com/ios/update)), connecting iPhone to Mac and the last, some third party screen recorder. In this article, you will learn the three powerful methods one by one.

* [**Part1: Recording your iPhone screen in iOS 11**](#part1)
* [**Part2: Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac**](#part2)
* [**Part3: Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector**](#part3)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## 1\. Recording your iPhone screen in [iOS 11](https://www.apple.com/lae/ios/ios-11/)

You can find more information in this article: [How to Record iPhone/iPad’s Screen in iOS 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \>>

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## 2\. Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac

If you have a Mac then you already have all the software you need.

**Step 1**: Connect your tablet or smartphone to your computer using a USB port, and then open QuickTime on your Mac. In QuickTime select ‘File’ and ‘New Movie Recording’. A recording window will pop up.

**Step 2**: In the recording window there will be a red ‘record’ button. Next to that button there will be an arrow. Click the arrow and a menu of recording options will appear. In the section where it says ‘Camera’ select your iPhone or iPad. In this menu you can also choose whether or not to record audio from your device, such sound effects from games.

**Step 3**: Once you are finished in this menu click record to begin recording the screen of your device. Click ‘stop’ when you are finished recording.

Although you can download a version of QuickTime for PC, the PC version does not have a screen recording option. If you have a PC you will need to use the second method.

## 3\. Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)

If you either prefer to do things wirelessly or own a PC then you will need to use a slightly more round-about method. Rather than recording directly from your iPhone you will be mirroring your device’s interface onto your computer screen and then recording it there.

**Step 1**: First, you will need to download a third party mirroring app. Reflector is the popular choice. You can download Reflector at [Airsquirrels.com](http://www.airsquirrels.com/).Next, you need to have Apple’s Airplay on your device. Make sure Reflector that your computer and device are connected to the same wifi network.

**Step 2**: Open Reflector on your PC. Initially it will tell you there is no device connected.

**Step 3**: Open AirPlay on your device and make sure mirroring is turned on. Your computer’s name will show up as a receiver option. Select it.

**Step 4**: This will cause the display of your smartphone or tablet to pop up on your computer screen. Once your device is being mirrored on your computer, record your computer screen.

You can record your Mac or PC screen using Filmora Video Editor. Using Filmora you can crop out and record only your iPhone display instead of your entire computer screen. You can download the latest version of Filmora Video Editor at Filmora.wondershare.com.

If you have a Mac you can also record your computer screen in QuickTime following the same steps listed above, until it comes time to choose your camera. Then you record your desktop instead of your device. There are a few different screen recording programs you can download for PC.

## Conclusion

After reading the three ways to record YouTube on iPhone/iPad, I am sure you want to give it a try. If you have any questions, please let us know!

### 4\. Loader.to (Web)

[Loader.to](https://loader.to/) really couldn't make it any easier to get the video or playlist you would like to download in almost any format you can think of, without even worrying about downloading yet another software application. Like Ddownr, Loader.to is completely based online, so you can access it from anywhere you'd like, on any device.

![youtube playlist downloader - loader.to](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-youtube-playlist-downloader.jpg)

When you reach the homepage, you will be greeted with a menu allowing you to choose your format for audio and video and the URL to the video or playlist you would like to download. That is it – it couldn't be simpler. For folks looking for a quick and easy-to-use way to download a YouTube playlist online, this is one of the best places to start.

### 5\. By Click Downloader (Windows)

[By Click Downloader](https://www.byclickdownloader.com/) is a software application for Windows computers that allows you to download full high-definition videos or audio from YouTube. You can choose to keep the whole video or convert it to audio-only formats such as .mp3 to listen to later on.

![youtube playlist downloader - by click downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-youtube-playlist-downloader.jpg)

The software is completely free to use but limited to being available on only one platform. If you are coming from macOS, Linux, or a smartphone OS, you will need to look elsewhere. For Windows users, however, By Click Downloader is a solid YouTube playlist downloader that anyone can use and understand.

### 6\. Snapdownloader (Windows)

[Snapdownloader](https://snapdownloader.com/) is another downloader software application that is only for Windows, which could limit some users. However, for the Windows-faithful out there, you have a great option to grab your favorite videos and playlists from YouTube for later viewing and listening. It supports more than just YouTube downloads, too – you can grab videos from Facebook and other sites in many different qualities, all the way up to 8k.

![youtube playlist downloader -snapdownloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-youtube-playlist-downloader.jpg)

To make things even easier for you, the application has a built-in video editor of sorts that allows you to trim your videos as you see fit, so if you need to make them a little smaller for simpler storage on low-capacity hard drives, this might be the best option for you to grab those YouTube playlists you love.
