Initially, iOS users had the option to load videos directly to YouTube via the tap-to-upload feature. However, this option is missing in the recent iOS devices versions. Therefore, many users search for possible ways to post a video on YouTube from iPhone. For this, you have to put some considerations into place before moving on. The video title length should not exceed 100 characters, while the description is maintained at 5,000 characters. Also, ensure the video length doesn't exceed 15 minutes. Let's roll out the best ways to upload your videos and make that big catch on subscribers.

#### Method 1: Upload using the YouTube iOS app

Using the YouTube app is the simplest way to upload your YouTube videos. The YouTube app should be installed on your iOS device.

**Step 1.** Launch the YouTube app on your device, then sign in to your account. If you don't have an account yet, you will need to "Sign up" for a new one before continuing the upload process.

**Step 2.** Click on the "+" icon found at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3.** Then choose the "Upload a video" option from the populated list of options.

**Step 4.** Check out the pop-up that appears and "Allow access" to it.

**Step 5.** Edit your video to your preference by trimming or cropping as you desire. Then click on the "Next" option.

![upload youtube video from iphone using ios app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-youtube-video-from-iphone-2.png)

**Step 6.** Add "title and description" to your video. Remember, the title should contain less than 100 characters and the description no more than 500 characters.

**Step 7.** Then set the visibility mode as "Public" to enable you to share your video over the internet.

**Step 8.** Click on the "Upload" button to finally upload your video to YouTube.

## Why your phone doesn't post videos to YouTube

Despite learning how to upload to YouTube from iPhone, you may be perplexed to realize that your phone refuses to post videos to YouTube. What could be the reason?

#### 1) YouTube issues

In most cases, the problem doesn't arise from your phone but from YouTube. This streaming app may also experience some hitches along the way. Remember that even if your phone sync with your YouTube account to upload videos from the "Camera Roll," YouTube isn't managed from the Camera Roll but the YouTube app directly. You can solve the issue by signing out of your YouTube account and signing back in.

#### 2) Connection Strength

Some videos may appear quite large and cause a time-out during the upload process. Check your Wi-Fi or internet connection strength to determine if it needs a boost or wait until the streaming strength is strong for a quick upload. Test your internet speed by searching "internet test speed" on Google. Then click the "Run Speed Test" in the search box. A window will open and give you an estimate of the Mbps that your connection is operating at. If too low, switch to other alternatives.

#### 3) Verify your YouTube account

Verifying your account will help you to enjoy YouTube's full features. It's then that you'll manage to upload videos without any drawbacks. Also, that's when you'll manage to upload longer videos that go beyond the 15-minute duration.

#### 4) Pay attention to the video size

There is a limit for videos to post to YouTube. If it is too large or long, the upload will cancel before completion.

#### 5) Be patient

YouTube can save your partial upload for 24 hours. So, you can continue to upload from where you left. Learn to be patient as there could be a surge of user traffic, especially during evenings.
