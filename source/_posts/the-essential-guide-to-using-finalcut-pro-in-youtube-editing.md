## How to Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro

In this section, we are going to take a quick look at the steps that you need to take in order to properly edit YouTube videos in Final Cut Pro. Without any further ado, let's take a look.

#### Step 1: Importing the video clip into FCP

This is, of course, the first thing that you need to do. Regardless of whether the original footage was taken by your smart phone, taken from the Internet or you've left it over from some past event that's long overdue, you can easily import it into the FCP in order to edit it. FCP supports a variety of different formats, so it's a good idea to try and import the video even if you are not quite sure about its extension. In order to do so, open the program, go to the File button, click on Import and select the file or the folder. This is going to get you to a regular finder window which would enable you to pick the clip that you want to do. If it's not highlighted or you aren't able to select it, the software doesn't support it, and it's not compatible.

![Import YouTube videos in FCP ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-files-in-fcp.jpg)

Keep in mind that if you want to import videos which have been published already, you can download them directly from the channel as MP4 files. If you want to store videos from different channels, you can use the Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate in order to get them converted and stored on your computer in a format that is supported by FCP.

#### Step 2: Edit YouTube Videos in Final Cut Pro

That's the fun part. There are a few things that you can do with Final Cut Pro, and they are all quite professional.

* First, you can sync an audio track with your video as the DSLR cameras usually have terrible quality of the sound. This is why you want to get the audio recorded separately. The only thing you need to do is select the audio clip and click on the Synchronize Clips, and you are good to go.

![Synchronize clips in FCP ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sychronize-audio-clips-in-fcp.jpg)

* Furthermore, you can do proper color balancing with the program quickly and incredibly easy. Go on Modify and then click on **Balance Color** and the software is going to take care of the rest on its own.

![adjust youtube video scale and position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flip-clips-in-fcp-2.png)

* You can also create previews when the video ends. In order to do so, you need to import your main clip, select a solid background color and place the preview video above it. You will then be able to trim and edit it conveniently. Adjust the scale and the position and you are good to go. Afterwards, you can also apply annotation on top of the preview.

#### Step 3: Upload to YouTube from the software directly

![Upload video to YouTube from FCP](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-to-youtube-from-fcp.jpg)

This one is rather easy. Here is the sequence that you need to do. Go to File -> Share -> Master File -> Setting -> File -> Share -> YouTube. That's basically it. Then you need to sign in to your YouTube account and simply click on Next -> Publish and the entire thing is done. That's all you need to do in order to quickly and conveniently upload your video to YouTube directly from the FCP.

**Subscribe**\- This allows the users to quickly subscribe to the channel. You may change the appearance of the icon and how your brand name looks.

**Channel**\- Click on this element to promote other YouTube Channel. You may also customize it with a message.

**2.** Use three or less cards per video. Viewers are more likely to click your cards if there are fewer of them, and more likely to start ignoring them if it seems like they’re always popping up. Also, do not have all three of these cards appear at once and make people choose between them. Stagger them throughout your video.

**3.** Your cards should be related to what you are saying in your vlog. Avoid posting completely random links in the middle of your video because a viewer who clicks on them will get confused. You can post any type of link you want at the very end of your video, though.

 **4.** The end of your video is always a great place to link viewers to another of your videos, whether you use a card or an end screen. If somebody liked your video enough to watch until the end they’ll probably welcome a chance to consume similar content.

## Conclusion

Now, that you are aware how to add YouTube end screen to your video, make use of the amazing features of YouTube end screen and cards and let driving in traffic to your site be easy and fruitful.

## Part 1: Why You Need to Add End Screens and Cards to Videos

There are several reasons that make the YouTube end screen and cards a great tool when added to the videos. The new channel builtin features, donation choices, embedded polls and more are some of the best interactive and powerful features of YouTube end screen that’s when added to the video can drive in users to your channel. It is a strong tool to build viewership of your channel. When you use YouTube end screen at the end of the video, it helps in directing the users to other channels, playlists, and videos and also helps in promoting crowdfunding campaigns, merchandise and website. The YouTube end screen is a part of the video and to have an end screen on your video, it must be around 25seconds long.

## Part 2: How To Use Youtube End Screen

Do you wish to add YouTube end screen to your video? Just follow the steps and get going.

* Go to Creator Studio and check the left side to find the Video Manager, click on it.
* Wherever you wish to add the end screen on the video, click on it.
* Click End Screen & Annotations at the top.
* From end screen and annotations, you can add or configure elements.
* Check how the end screen will appear to the visitors.
* Click on blue color add element’s button to find four options available there:

**Playlist or Videos**\- This element allows to play the suggested video on the same tab when the user clicks on it.

**Subscribe**\- This allows the users to quickly subscribe to the channel. You may change the appearance of the icon and how your brand name looks.

**Channel**\- Click on this element to promote other YouTube Channel. You may also customize it with a message.

**Link**\- This element helps in sending the users directly to your website. Although, Google has restricted other link addition in the video. In order to add, you must have an Adsense account and permit monetization.

## Part 3: How To Use Youtube Cards

YouTube Cards is more interactive. Users can add images and other linkes. Here are the steps.

* Click on the "Video Manager" tab.
* If you want to add cards, Click "Edit" tab under it. Then click “cards”.
* Choose the cards type you want to make on "Add Card" drop down menu.
* Click “create” button. Select the timeline. In the end, apply.

### The types of YouTube cards

* **Video or playlist**: links to other videos/the complete palylist on YouTube related or non-related to that specific videolinks to further purchase websites or specific product.
* **Channel**: promote another YouTube channel, one of the most common methods to collaborate with other YouTubers
* **Poll**: Encourage viewers to participate in a poll (vote)
* **Link**: links to a website which compliments whatever content is in the video.

### 4 Tips for Using YouTube Cards

**1\.** You might be used to pointing to the part of your screen where you intend to put an annotation, but when you use YouTube Cards they might switch locations depending on what device a viewer is watching on.

**2.** Use three or less cards per video. Viewers are more likely to click your cards if there are fewer of them, and more likely to start ignoring them if it seems like they’re always popping up. Also, do not have all three of these cards appear at once and make people choose between them. Stagger them throughout your video.

**3.** Your cards should be related to what you are saying in your vlog. Avoid posting completely random links in the middle of your video because a viewer who clicks on them will get confused. You can post any type of link you want at the very end of your video, though.

 **4.** The end of your video is always a great place to link viewers to another of your videos, whether you use a card or an end screen. If somebody liked your video enough to watch until the end they’ll probably welcome a chance to consume similar content.

## Conclusion

Now, that you are aware how to add YouTube end screen to your video, make use of the amazing features of YouTube end screen and cards and let driving in traffic to your site be easy and fruitful.
