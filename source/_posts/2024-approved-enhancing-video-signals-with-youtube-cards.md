YouTube Annotations and Cards are both tools for linking viewers to your other videos or to off-YouTube webpages. Two of the major differences between them are:

Annotations are not clickable on mobile devices.

You cannot choose the size or positioning of Cards.

This article will teach you about both Cards and Annotations and discuss the best uses for each of them.

**Part 1: Annotations**

Annotations are messages that float overtop of your videos in the YouTube player. Usually, annotations are clickable and take users to other content created by you.

**Section 1: Types of Annotations**

There are five types of YouTube annotations:

**Notes** are colored boxes placed over the top of your videos.

**Speech Bubbles** look like dialogue boxes in a comic strip. They have tails that you can adjust so it looks like one of the people in your video is saying what is written in the annotation.

**Spotlights** have a subtle border and are completely clear inside. Your text only appears when a viewer’s cursor hovers over top of these annotations.

**Labels** are like spotlights except that viewers do not have to hover over them for your text to be visible.

Any of these annotations can be used to link viewers to other videos, or as subscribe links. You can also add a simple **Title** to your video through the Annotations menu.

**Section 2: How to Use Annotations**

\*Note: the above video mentions Pause annotations, which are no longer available.

Here are two of the best uses for annotations:

**Clickable End Cards / Outros**

One of the best ways you can use spotlight annotations is to create clickable end cards for your videos.

When your video finishes playing the YouTube player will display a selection of suggested videos that might direct viewers away from your channel. You can keep more of these viewers watching your content by creating your own ‘suggested videos’ card and putting it at the end of your videos.

Put thumbnails of two or three of your other videos on your end card, or use ‘picture-in-picture’ to actually imbed footage from them. Then, after you upload your video, go in and place clickable spotlight annotations over top of your video thumbnails.

This is one use for annotations that cannot be duplicated with cards.

**Promoting Your Videos**

You should not wait until the end of your video to start linking viewers to other content. Many viewers will click away before they see your end card because your video is not exactly what they were looking for. By placing note or speech bubble annotations occasionally throughout your videos you can catch some of these people before they click off of your channel.

This works especially well if you link to videos on similar subjects to the one you are annotating.

Instead of just linking to another video of yours, try to link to that video on a playlist. Once a viewer is on a playlist your videos will auto-play after each other, which is good for both your view count and watch time.

You can also use the newer YouTube Cards for this, but Annotations might still be a better choice because viewers only need to click once vs. twice for Cards.

Try both and see which performs best for your channel. It might be in your best interest to keep on using both as they target different audiences – Cards are clickable on mobile devices, for example, but Annotations are not.

#### **Part 2: YouTube Cards**

YouTube Cards are newer than annotations and a lot of people believe they will one day replace Annotations. While there are benefits to Cards – like embedding images to represent your links – you cannot choose the shape, size, or placement of them. This means they have limited uses.

When viewers click on a Card they are shown additional information and a thumbnail representing the page they will be taken to if they choose to click again. This extra step could be either help viewers decide to click your links or give them a second chance to decide they would rather not.

**Section 1: When to Use Cards**

A linked Annotation is simply a call to action viewers can click on. A Card is a call to action as well, but instead of taking the viewer directly to where its link leads when it is clicked a Card opens up into a larger version of itself with a thumbnail image.

Crowdfunding pages (Patreon is a great choice for video creators), charity fundraising pages, and merchandise stores are all examples of links that benefit from the format of YouTube Cards.

When you link a viewer to a non-YouTube page you break up their session time, which negatively impacts your watch time and SEO ranking. You want to make sure that the viewers you are directing away from YouTube are the ones most likely to convert after they leave. By ‘convert’ we mean to contribute to your Patreon campaign, donate to the charity you are promoting, or buy some of your merchandise.

Giving viewers more information and a thumbnail through a Card can help ensure the most interested viewers are the ones clicking your links.

You’re probably familiar with **haul videos** if you're highly familiar with YouTube in recent years. This type of content can offer immense benefits to both influencers and small retail businesses.

Though they may not be quite as existent as they once were, it’s still essential to know the potential effect of these try-on-haul videos. They are valuable to spread the word about your brand and attract helpful content for your target audience. Here’s a quick guide to learn the ins and outs of haul videos.

#### In this article

01 [What is a Haul Video?](#part1)

02 [Why is Haul Videos Popular?](#part2)

03 [Get Inspired from Fashion YouTubers to Find Out the Point of Try on Hauls](#part3)

04 [How to Make a Catchy Haul Video?](#part4)

## **Part 1: What is a Haul Video?**

Generally, a haul video is a recording of someone showcasing a collection of purchases. They may go into depth about what each product is, their shopping experience, and their initial impressions as a whole. A haul generally consists of products from a single retailer, a specific collection of shops, or at least a particular category. The products can be confined to one niche or brand, or type.

Such haul videos initially gained importance or hype around 2006/2007 through the community of beauty vloggers on YouTube as YouTube try-on-haul videos. And since the market for them isn't that saturated, it could be an exciting time for businesses to dive in.

Haul videos generally contain products that the influencer has selected to define why they liked each item promptly. In certain sections or niches like makeup or clothing haul videos, the person may even try to offer the viewer an honest whole first impression.

## **Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?**

Having YouTube as a source of everyone’s daily dose of entertainment, we can’t help but wonder why haul videos tend to be so famous. Most YouTubers create at least one haul video regardless of their niche. They could be grocery hauls; underwear hauls, weird candy hauls, face mask hauls, candle hauls, and more. And the list goes on and on.

They are popular because they can help you connect to potential consumers via influencers as a small retail business. Generally, viewers watch and subscribe to YouTube videos of influencers or creators they trust or share similar preferences in products.

So when that influencer shares a collection of their favorite products, the viewers might decide to purchase one as well.

On the influencer side, haul videos can offer a way to share valuable content with your audience. If you have a YouTube channel, Instagram account, Facebook page, or blog, providing insights on the products you love can help your audience shape their own purchasing decisions.

It also creates a natural way to infuse some brand-related content into your content creation strategy. This can lead to profitable connections for your business in the future.

And since we're very much intrigued by the glorifying fast fashion, excessive materialism, and hoarding, I'm getting my hands dirty with information. So, here's what I've gathered:

## **Part 4: How to Make a Catchy Haul Video?**

Haul videos are easy and fun to shoot. It’s a great way of showcasing your followers and subscribers your personal style, how you shop and what your favorite stores are. Keeping in mind the mantras used by famous haul video creators, we’ve gathered a step-by-step guide below using which you can instantly create a catchy try-on haul video.

### 1. Create a good setup

Have ideal filming set up or area. Make sure that the lighting is accurate – not enough light will make the video dark. It is often best to film such haul videos during the day, using natural sunlight. However, you can also use desk lamps to help enhance the lighting situation.

### 2. Do a test video first with your shooting equipment

Put your camera on a flat surface if available. You can also use your computer’s webcam to shoot your haul video, once it is of excellent quality. You can sit on a chair or desk while facing the camera or even on the floor.

You can even take someone else to film the video for you! Try filming some test videos to check if the camera position is fine and the microphone is working. You’re ready to film once you’re satisfied.

### 3. Speak clearly and perform better

Speak in a clear voice, and gaze directly at the camera. You need to crack a few jokes or smile often throughout the video – you don't want to come across as a serious or boring person to your viewers! Make sure that you're comfortable presenting in front of a camera.

Begin by greeting the viewers (a simple "Hello, everyone!"), then you can offer a prompt description of your shopping trip. You can tell them the stores you visited or in-store events that occurred while there, like giveaways.

Act as if you're directly conversing with one of your friends – it's one of the comfy tricks you can follow. You can write some keywords if you think it would help and pin it somewhere where you can look through it quickly, such as the camera tripod or on the wall surface behind the camera or computer.

### 4. Clearly show off the products you bought

Show off the products you got! Hold the camera and show them to the audience in depth. You can also describe why you purchased each item, the price, plus any special discounts. Moreover, it is a great idea to keep all of your receipts and bills.

### 5. Don’t forget to use an ideal video editor

Use a video editing program to revamp your raw footage and make it look more professional. In excitement, you'd want to upload it as quickly as you can, but it's better to invest a little time editing it so that you can publish a video with superb quality.

If there are any sections in your video that you don't look for in the finished product, you can remove them. Plus, you can add special effects such as floating text and captions. All of this can be instantly done with the beginner-friendly and popular video editing program by Wondershare Filmora.

You’re probably familiar with **haul videos** if you're highly familiar with YouTube in recent years. This type of content can offer immense benefits to both influencers and small retail businesses.

They are valuable to spread the word about your brand and attract helpful content for your target audience. Here’s a quick guide to learn the ins and outs of haul videos.

## **Part 1: What is a Haul Video?**

Generally, a haul video is a recording of someone showcasing a collection of purchases. They may go into depth about what each product is, their shopping experience, and their initial impressions as a whole. A haul generally consists of products from a single retailer, a specific collection of shops, or at least a particular category. The products can be confined to one niche or brand, or type.

Such haul videos initially gained importance or hype around 2006/2007 through the community of beauty vloggers on YouTube as YouTube try-on-haul videos. And since the market for them isn't that saturated, it could be an exciting time for businesses to dive in.

Haul videos generally contain products that the influencer has selected to define why they liked each item promptly. In certain sections or niches like makeup or clothing haul videos, the person may even try to offer the viewer an honest whole first impression.

## **Part 2: Why is Haul Videos Popular?**

Having YouTube as a source of everyone’s daily dose of entertainment, we can’t help but wonder why haul videos tend to be so famous. Most YouTubers create at least one haul video regardless of their niche. They could be grocery hauls; underwear hauls, weird candy hauls, face mask hauls, candle hauls, and more. And the list goes on and on.

They are popular because they can help you connect to potential consumers via influencers as a small retail business. Generally, viewers watch and subscribe to YouTube videos of influencers or creators they trust or share similar preferences in products.

So when that influencer shares a collection of their favorite products, the viewers might decide to purchase one as well.

On the influencer side, haul videos can offer a way to share valuable content with your audience. If you have a YouTube channel, Instagram account, Facebook page, or blog, providing insights on the products you love can help your audience shape their own purchasing decisions.

It also creates a natural way to infuse some brand-related content into your content creation strategy. This can lead to profitable connections for your business in the future.

And since we're very much intrigued by the glorifying fast fashion, excessive materialism, and hoarding, I'm getting my hands dirty with information. So, here's what I've gathered:

## **Part 4: How to Make a Catchy Haul Video?**

Haul videos are easy and fun to shoot. It’s a great way of showcasing your followers and subscribers your personal style, how you shop and what your favorite stores are. Keeping in mind the mantras used by famous haul video creators, we’ve gathered a step-by-step guide below using which you can instantly create a catchy try-on haul video.

### 1. Create a good setup

Have ideal filming set up or area. Make sure that the lighting is accurate – not enough light will make the video dark. It is often best to film such haul videos during the day, using natural sunlight. However, you can also use desk lamps to help enhance the lighting situation.

### 2. Do a test video first with your shooting equipment

Put your camera on a flat surface if available. You can also use your computer’s webcam to shoot your haul video, once it is of excellent quality. You can sit on a chair or desk while facing the camera or even on the floor.

You can even take someone else to film the video for you! Try filming some test videos to check if the camera position is fine and the microphone is working. You’re ready to film once you’re satisfied.

### 3. Speak clearly and perform better

Speak in a clear voice, and gaze directly at the camera. You need to crack a few jokes or smile often throughout the video – you don't want to come across as a serious or boring person to your viewers! Make sure that you're comfortable presenting in front of a camera.

Begin by greeting the viewers (a simple "Hello, everyone!"), then you can offer a prompt description of your shopping trip. You can tell them the stores you visited or in-store events that occurred while there, like giveaways.

Act as if you're directly conversing with one of your friends – it's one of the comfy tricks you can follow. You can write some keywords if you think it would help and pin it somewhere where you can look through it quickly, such as the camera tripod or on the wall surface behind the camera or computer.

### 4. Clearly show off the products you bought

Show off the products you got! Hold the camera and show them to the audience in depth. You can also describe why you purchased each item, the price, plus any special discounts. Moreover, it is a great idea to keep all of your receipts and bills.

### 5. Don’t forget to use an ideal video editor

Use a video editing program to revamp your raw footage and make it look more professional. In excitement, you'd want to upload it as quickly as you can, but it's better to invest a little time editing it so that you can publish a video with superb quality.

If you have a social network page or a blog that you would like your YouTube viewers to consider worth checking, you can create short-form content either at the beginning or end of the video, with the short message and a URL. They'll indeed check out your blog if your subscribers enjoy your content! And, it's a friendly manner to build an audience and get traffic to your other pages!

### Conclusion

Our final verdict is that haul videos are just entertaining to make and fun to watch with all the discussion above! Such videos can manipulate consumer trends and shape the meaning-making of individuals. They allow you to explore fun even just by living vicariously and shopping all the way long! Also, it's equally important to consider further beautifying video through the most accessible yet professional editing programs like the Wondershare Filmora.
