##### Step 3Organize Your Project Material

Manage the files you will be using in the editing project. Creating a folder for the project allows you to organize the file using different criteria such as type or purpose such as food footage.

##### Step 4Place Files on the Timeline

Time to start editing your video. Place the video and audio files on the timeline while removing the redundant parts. Use the drag-and-drop feature to edit the clips, one at a time, cutting out unneeded footage to have a clear story.

##### Step 5Apply Visual Effects

After removing the unwanted parts from the video clips, detach the audio and video files. Insert transitions between clips, add music, and use other visual effects on Filmora to make the video more exciting.

##### Step 6Conduct the Color Correction Process

The effects icon gives you access to filters and overlays to make your video colors more vivid. Select the filters of choice, and drag and drop it to where you want to use on the timeline.

##### Step 7Export and Share

Once you are satisfied with the video outcome, export it in MP4 format, ready for upload on YouTube. Save it in your local drive, and upload it to YouTube via the Creator Studio.
