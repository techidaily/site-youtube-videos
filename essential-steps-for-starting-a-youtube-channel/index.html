<p>People create YouTube accounts for a lot of different reasons. Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic. If you are considering starting your own YouTube channel then you should take a second to consider why you want to, since this will have an impact on what kind of videos you make. Your reasons for wanting to make a YouTube account do not have to be very elaborate. Maybe you just think it will be fun. Good news; it will be!</p>
<p>Once you know for sure that you want to create a YouTube account, and also know why you want to do it, you have already started building your channel. There are still a few important things to consider, though. This article will walk you through signing up for a YouTube account, and give you some tips about starting your channel.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps"><a href="#Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps"></a>Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p>
<p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"
                      alt="account sign in screen"
                ></p>
<p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"
                      alt="account new gmail"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-after-new-gmail.JPG"
                      alt="account after new gmail"
                ></p>
<p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p>
<p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p>
<p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p>
<p>6. After you finish the form click Next Step and, in the next screen, Continue to YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel"></a>Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel</h2><h4 id="1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love"><a href="#1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p>
<p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p>
<h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p>
<p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose a Great Name"></a>3. Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p>
<p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p>
<p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule"></a>4. Make a Schedule</h4><p>Maintaining a YouTube channel is a big time commitment. You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p>
<h4 id="5-Take-Inventory"><a href="#5-Take-Inventory" class="headerlink" title="5. Take Inventory"></a>5. Take Inventory</h4><p>Think about what equipment you have that you can use for your YouTube channel. The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p>

Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p>
<p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p>

You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p>

<p>People create YouTube accounts for a lot of different reasons. Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic. If you are considering starting your own YouTube channel then you should take a second to consider why you want to, since this will have an impact on what kind of videos you make. Your reasons for wanting to make a YouTube account do not have to be very elaborate. Maybe you just think it will be fun. Good news; it will be!</p>
<p>Once you know for sure that you want to create a YouTube account, and also know why you want to do it, you have already started building your channel. There are still a few important things to consider, though. This article will walk you through signing up for a YouTube account, and give you some tips about starting your channel.</p>
<h2 id="Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps-2"><a href="#Creating-Your-YouTube-Account-in-6-Steps-2" class="headerlink" title="Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps"></a>Creating Your YouTube Account in 6 Steps</h2><p>1. Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p>
<p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"
                      alt="account sign in screen"
                ></p>
<p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"
                      alt="account new gmail"
                ></p>
<p><img

                      alt="account after new gmail"
                ></p>
<p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p>
<p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p>
<p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p>
<p>6. After you finish the form click Next Step and, in the next screen, Continue to YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel-2"><a href="#Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel-2" class="headerlink" title="Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel"></a>Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel</h2><h4 id="1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love-2"><a href="#1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p>
<p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p>
<h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition-2"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p>

<p>Many people have a strong desire to make videos. Whether you make videos for a living or as a pastime, it doesn’t matter. When you make a fantastic film that you’re pleased with, you want to show it off to your friends and family. YouTube, the most popular site for sharing videos on various themes, is one of the most incredible places to start.</p>
<p>YouTube is fantastic for sharing videos, but it can be harsh on artists due to the high bar for content and video quality. If you want to succeed as a YouTuber, you must create videos that are informative and high-resolution. This is critical since your viewers may wish to watch your movies on a computer screen or a 4K smart TV.</p>
<p>If you’ve decided to make videos in 4K resolution, you’ll find information on recommended encoding settings, how to upload a video to YouTube, potential problems, and more below.</p>

Low resolution indicates fewer pixels and typically less space, whereas high resolution means more pixels and generally greater space and detail. You probably have a poor resolution if you’re using a standard laptop or an old screen.</p>
<p>When watching a video on a larger screen, the resolution significantly impacts your viewing experience. Whether it’s a live stream or an on-demand movie, the correct resolution is crucial to reaching a wider audience, and this is where iPhones and iPads appear to have an advantage. Let’s take a closer look at each of these resolution types and their associated pixel sizes.</p>
<h4 id="1-SD-RESOLUTION-STANDARD-DEFINITION"><a href="#1-SD-RESOLUTION-STANDARD-DEFINITION" class="headerlink" title="1. SD RESOLUTION (STANDARD DEFINITION)"></a>1. SD RESOLUTION (STANDARD DEFINITION)</h4><p>Previously, resolutions were separated into SD (Standard Definition) and HD (High Definition) categories. SD was defined as a video with a resolution of less than 720p. However, as television and computer monitor display resolutions improved over time, a video was less likely to be shot in Standard Definition.</p>
<p>The following are the most common standard video resolutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>640 × 360 pixels (or 360p)</li>
<li>640 × 480 pixels (or 480p)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-RESOLUTION-720P-HD-HIGH-DEFINITION"><a href="#2-RESOLUTION-720P-HD-HIGH-DEFINITION" class="headerlink" title="2. RESOLUTION: 720P HD (HIGH DEFINITION)"></a>2. RESOLUTION: 720P HD (HIGH DEFINITION)</h4><p>The lowest video resolution is 720p, which is commonly referred to as ‘HD.’ 720p (1280 x 720 pixels) is a resolution recognized for modest web content, even though most videos require at least 1080p. Because most computer monitors are now in HD, the recommended practice for web and streaming is to choose a resolution higher than 720p.</p>
<p>The resolution of HD videos is usually: 1280 x 720 pixels (or 720p)</p>
<h4 id="3-1080P-FULL-HD-RESOLUTION"><a href="#3-1080P-FULL-HD-RESOLUTION" class="headerlink" title="3. 1080P FULL HD RESOLUTION"></a>3. 1080P FULL HD RESOLUTION</h4><p>1080p resolutions, also known as ‘Full HD,’ have become the industry standard for a clear HD video that doesn’t take up a lot of storage space. It’s also worth noting that this is the standard screen resolution for all smartphones.</p>
<p>The resolution of full HD videos is usually: 1920 x 1080 pixels (or 1080p)</p>
<h4 id="4-2K-RESOLUTION-WITH-QHD-QUAD-HIGH-DEFINITION"><a href="#4-2K-RESOLUTION-WITH-QHD-QUAD-HIGH-DEFINITION" class="headerlink" title="4. 2K RESOLUTION WITH QHD (QUAD HIGH DEFINITION)"></a>4. 2K RESOLUTION WITH QHD (QUAD HIGH DEFINITION)</h4><p>Quad HD resolution, or QHD for short, is widely found on high-end smartphones and gaming monitors. The resolution of 1440p is four times that of HD Ready (or 720p HD). Many high-end smartphones have a Quad HD+ resolution (296 x 1440 pixels), which is ideal for 1440p. Another common screen resolution is 2K, which allows for larger displays and reframing without sacrificing quality or image editing.</p>
<p>The resolution of QHD and 2K videos is:</p>
<ul>
<li>2560 x 1440 pixels in QHD (or 1440p)</li>
<li>2048 x 1080 pixels in 2K (or 1080p)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-4K-OR-UHD-ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION-RESOLUTION"><a href="#5-4K-OR-UHD-ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION-RESOLUTION" class="headerlink" title="5. 4K (OR UHD&#x2F;ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION) RESOLUTION"></a>5. 4K (OR UHD&#x2F;ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION) RESOLUTION</h4><p>This sort of resolution, often known as 4Kor UHD (Ultra High Definition), has a pixel size of 3840 x 2160 pixels. It has a similar appearance to 2K, but it provides video artists more room to edit and zoom in. For vivid color, graphics, or dramatic viewing, both 2K and 4K resolutions are available. Unless you wish to tweak colors or trim in closer, there aren’t enough visible distinctions between 2K and 4K. So, it matters when you want to change a certain detail, but it doesn’t matter when someone else is looking at it.</p>
<p>The resolution of 4K videos is: 3840 x 2160 (or 2160p &#x2F; simply 4K) is a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Would-You-Want-To-Upload-A-4k-Video"><a href="#Why-Would-You-Want-To-Upload-A-4k-Video" class="headerlink" title="Why Would You Want To Upload A 4k Video?"></a>Why Would You Want To Upload A 4k Video?</h2><p>YouTube is the second-largest social media site, with approximately 1.9 billion monthly active users. YouTube is where you want to be to access this large audience and promote your brand, with one billion hours of video watched every day on the platform.</p>
<p>However, for your target audience to watch your videos, you must ensure excellent video quality. Poorly shot or edited films may alienate your viewers, especially when there are billions of other videos to choose from on the site.</p>
<ul>
<li>4k is the most satisfactory resolution for uploading to YouTube. Although not every viewer can watch videos in 4k, it ensures that your visitors get the best possible experience.</li>
<li>Traditional Full HD (1920 x 1080) TVs feature four times as many pixels as 4K TVs. Because of the higher pixel density, the picture quality of 4K TVs is more colorful and detailed, even on TV displays of the same size. This distinction is most noticeable on large-screen televisions.</li>
<li>Even if you recorded in 1080p and upscaled to 4K, you should post in 4K to YouTube for the finest image quality. Recording in 1080p, editing in 1080p, exporting in 4k, and YouTube viewing is sharper in 1080p.</li>
<li>With 4K, you get stunning visuals with a resolution of 38402160, which is four times that of Full-HD. That’s why visuals appear crisp and lifelike, even on large-screen TVs rather than pixelated. Down-converted 4K to Full-HD photographs have superior quality and resolution than images shot in Full-HD from the start.</li>

<h4 id="2-Youtube-Video-Export"><a href="#2-Youtube-Video-Export" class="headerlink" title="2. Youtube Video Export"></a>2. Youtube Video Export</h4><p>You can also modify your videos in various formats to your heart’s content before exporting them to YouTube and publishing them.

Do not become worried. Your 4K video will be in low resolution when you first publish it. This is due to YouTube’s high-resolution processing requiring time. It could take a few hours for your video to be available in 4K mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The duration, format, frame rate, and resolution of your video all affect the processing time for high-definition videos. If you don’t want your video to be seen unless it has a high-quality option, upload it as unlisted and then publish it once 4K resolution is available.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> This is pretty much everything we’ve gathered to assist you in uploading 4K videos to YouTube. Do not become worried. Your 4K video will be in low resolution when you first publish it. This is due to YouTube’s high-resolution processing requiring time. It could take a few hours for your video to be available in 4K mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The duration, format, frame rate, and resolution of your video all affect the processing time for high-definition videos. If you don’t want your video to be seen unless it has a high-quality option, upload it as unlisted and then publish it once 4K resolution is available.</p>

<p>Many people have a strong desire to make videos. Whether you make videos for a living or as a pastime, it doesn’t matter. When you make a fantastic film that you’re pleased with, you want to show it off to your friends and family. YouTube, the most popular site for sharing videos on various themes, is one of the most incredible places to start.</p>
<p>YouTube is fantastic for sharing videos, but it can be harsh on artists due to the high bar for content and video quality. If you want to succeed as a YouTuber, you must create videos that are informative and high-resolution. This is critical since your viewers may wish to watch your movies on a computer screen or a 4K smart TV.</p>
<p>If you’ve decided to make videos in 4K resolution, you’ll find information on recommended encoding settings, how to upload a video to YouTube, potential problems, and more below.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-The-Distinction-Between-Various-Resolutions-2"><a href="#What-Is-The-Distinction-Between-Various-Resolutions-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Distinction Between Various Resolutions?"></a>What Is The Distinction Between Various Resolutions?</h2><p>The number of pixels on a screen is referred to as resolution. Low resolution indicates fewer pixels and typically less space, whereas high resolution means more pixels and generally greater space and detail. You probably have a poor resolution if you’re using a standard laptop or an old screen.</p>
<p>When watching a video on a larger screen, the resolution significantly impacts your viewing experience. Whether it’s a live stream or an on-demand movie, the correct resolution is crucial to reaching a wider audience, and this is where iPhones and iPads appear to have an advantage. Let’s take a closer look at each of these resolution types and their associated pixel sizes.</p>
<h4 id="1-SD-RESOLUTION-STANDARD-DEFINITION-2"><a href="#1-SD-RESOLUTION-STANDARD-DEFINITION-2" class="headerlink" title="1. SD RESOLUTION (STANDARD DEFINITION)"></a>1. SD RESOLUTION (STANDARD DEFINITION)</h4><p>Previously, resolutions were separated into SD (Standard Definition) and HD (High Definition) categories. SD was defined as a video with a resolution of less than 720p. However, as television and computer monitor display resolutions improved over time, a video was less likely to be shot in Standard Definition.</p>
<p>The following are the most common standard video resolutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>640 × 360 pixels (or 360p)</li>
<li>640 × 480 pixels (or 480p)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-RESOLUTION-720P-HD-HIGH-DEFINITION-2"><a href="#2-RESOLUTION-720P-HD-HIGH-DEFINITION-2" class="headerlink" title="2. RESOLUTION: 720P HD (HIGH DEFINITION)"></a>2. RESOLUTION: 720P HD (HIGH DEFINITION)</h4><p>The lowest video resolution is 720p, which is commonly referred to as ‘HD.’ 720p (1280 x 720 pixels) is a resolution recognized for modest web content, even though most videos require at least 1080p. Because most computer monitors are now in HD, the recommended practice for web and streaming is to choose a resolution higher than 720p.</p>
<p>The resolution of HD videos is usually: 1280 x 720 pixels (or 720p)</p>
<h4 id="3-1080P-FULL-HD-RESOLUTION-2"><a href="#3-1080P-FULL-HD-RESOLUTION-2" class="headerlink" title="3. 1080P FULL HD RESOLUTION"></a>3. 1080P FULL HD RESOLUTION</h4><p>1080p resolutions, also known as ‘Full HD,’ have become the industry standard for a clear HD video that doesn’t take up a lot of storage space. It’s also worth noting that this is the standard screen resolution for all smartphones.</p>
<p>The resolution of full HD videos is usually: 1920 x 1080 pixels (or 1080p)</p>
<h4 id="4-2K-RESOLUTION-WITH-QHD-QUAD-HIGH-DEFINITION-2"><a href="#4-2K-RESOLUTION-WITH-QHD-QUAD-HIGH-DEFINITION-2" class="headerlink" title="4. 2K RESOLUTION WITH QHD (QUAD HIGH DEFINITION)"></a>4. 2K RESOLUTION WITH QHD (QUAD HIGH DEFINITION)</h4><p>Quad HD resolution, or QHD for short, is widely found on high-end smartphones and gaming monitors. The resolution of 1440p is four times that of HD Ready (or 720p HD). Many high-end smartphones have a Quad HD+ resolution (296 x 1440 pixels), which is ideal for 1440p. Another common screen resolution is 2K, which allows for larger displays and reframing without sacrificing quality or image editing.</p>
<p>The resolution of QHD and 2K videos is:</p>
<ul>
<li>2560 x 1440 pixels in QHD (or 1440p)</li>
<li>2048 x 1080 pixels in 2K (or 1080p)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-4K-OR-UHD-ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION-RESOLUTION-2"><a href="#5-4K-OR-UHD-ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION-RESOLUTION-2" class="headerlink" title="5. 4K (OR UHD&#x2F;ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION) RESOLUTION"></a>5. 4K (OR UHD&#x2F;ULTRA-HIGH-DEFINITION) RESOLUTION</h4><p>This sort of resolution, often known as 4Kor UHD (Ultra High Definition), has a pixel size of 3840 x 2160 pixels. It has a similar appearance to 2K, but it provides video artists more room to edit and zoom in. For vivid color, graphics, or dramatic viewing, both 2K and 4K resolutions are available. Unless you wish to tweak colors or trim in closer, there aren’t enough visible distinctions between 2K and 4K. So, it matters when you want to change a certain detail, but it doesn’t matter when someone else is looking at it.</p>
<p>The resolution of 4K videos is: 3840 x 2160 (or 2160p &#x2F; simply 4K) is a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Would-You-Want-To-Upload-A-4k-Video-2"><a href="#Why-Would-You-Want-To-Upload-A-4k-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Would You Want To Upload A 4k Video?"></a>Why Would You Want To Upload A 4k Video?</h2><p>YouTube is the second-largest social media site, with approximately 1.9 billion monthly active users. YouTube is where you want to be to access this large audience and promote your brand, with one billion hours of video watched every day on the platform.</p>
<p>However, for your target audience to watch your videos, you must ensure excellent video quality. Poorly shot or edited films may alienate your viewers, especially when there are billions of other videos to choose from on the site.</p>
<ul>
<li>4k is the most satisfactory resolution for uploading to YouTube. Although not every viewer can watch videos in 4k, it ensures that your visitors get the best possible experience.</li>
<li>Traditional Full HD (1920 x 1080) TVs feature four times as many pixels as 4K TVs. Because of the higher pixel density, the picture quality of 4K TVs is more colorful and detailed, even on TV displays of the same size. This distinction is most noticeable on large-screen televisions.</li>
<li>Even if you recorded in 1080p and upscaled to 4K, you should post in 4K to YouTube for the finest image quality. Recording in 1080p, editing in 1080p, exporting in 4k, and YouTube viewing is sharper in 1080p.</li>
<li>With 4K, you get stunning visuals with a resolution of 38402160, which is four times that of Full-HD. That’s why visuals appear crisp and lifelike, even on large-screen TVs rather than pixelated. Down-converted 4K to Full-HD photographs have superior quality and resolution than images shot in Full-HD from the start.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-Is-The-Best-Way-To-Upload-A-4k-Video-To-Youtube-2"><a href="#What-Is-The-Best-Way-To-Upload-A-4k-Video-To-Youtube-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Best Way To Upload A 4k Video To Youtube?"></a>What Is The Best Way To Upload A 4k Video To Youtube?</h2><p>The YouTube upload process is not complicated, but it does need several steps. You can finally post your video once it has been prepared and converted to MP4 format.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to post your video to YouTube:</p>

<h4 id="1-Cut-Your-Video-Into-Clips-And-Organize-It-2"><a href="#1-Cut-Your-Video-Into-Clips-And-Organize-It-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Cut Your Video Into Clips And Organize It"></a>1. Cut Your Video Into Clips And Organize It</h4><p>While it may appear to be the simplest solution to perform an entire video at once, this might make the process tedious or even damage your video if you are interrupted or make a speech error. Smaller video segments are easier to edit and blend into a single, well-formatted video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Youtube-Video-Export-2"><a href="#2-Youtube-Video-Export-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Youtube Video Export"></a>2. Youtube Video Export</h4><p>You can also modify your videos in various formats to your heart’s content before exporting them to YouTube and publishing them. Although uploading and exporting may take some time, the quality of your video will significantly increase, and the time and work you put in will be evident.</p>
<h4 id="3-Change-Up-Your-Shots-2"><a href="#3-Change-Up-Your-Shots-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Change Up Your Shots"></a>3. Change Up Your Shots</h4><p>Rather than keeping your camera fixed, try varied angles while shooting. This may not work for all of your videos, but it is critical to keep your viewers engaged while they watch them, especially if you want them to stay until the finish and come back for more. Unless you’re talking about anything incredibly essential, sitting and listening to someone talk for more than 10 minutes without the camera moving will quickly become dull or old.</p>
<h4 id="4-Transitions-And-Effects-2"><a href="#4-Transitions-And-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Transitions And Effects"></a>4. Transitions And Effects</h4><p>When editing a video with numerous parts, the use of effects and transitions can considerably impact the overall quality of the video. Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmii is one of the greatest choices for Windows for beginners who wish to create video footage with templates automatically. Smart video templates, trendy filters and overlays, fun stickers and motion components, and, most importantly, advanced editing capabilities are all available.</p>

<p>8. Select if you want to add promotions to your video by clicking “Next.”</p>
<p>9. Finally, click “Next” and wait for the video to be processed entirely before publishing it.</p>
<p>10. You can also automatically set it to publish at a later date.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-On-How-To-Make-Sure-The-Video-You’re-Uploading-Is-Of-High-Quality-3"><a href="#Tips-On-How-To-Make-Sure-The-Video-You’re-Uploading-Is-Of-High-Quality-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips On How To Make Sure The Video You’re Uploading Is Of High Quality"></a>Tips On How To Make Sure The Video You’re Uploading Is Of High Quality</h2><p>The following are five tips for amateur and top newbie YouTubers who want to improve their videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Cut-Your-Video-Into-Clips-And-Organize-It-3"><a href="#1-Cut-Your-Video-Into-Clips-And-Organize-It-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Cut Your Video Into Clips And Organize It"></a>1. Cut Your Video Into Clips And Organize It</h4><p>While it may appear to be the simplest solution to perform an entire video at once, this might make the process tedious or even damage your video if you are interrupted or make a speech error. Smaller video segments are easier to edit and blend into a single, well-formatted video.</p>
<h4 id="2-Youtube-Video-Export-3"><a href="#2-Youtube-Video-Export-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Youtube Video Export"></a>2. Youtube Video Export</h4><p>You can also modify your videos in various formats to your heart’s content before exporting them to YouTube and publishing them. Although uploading and exporting may take some time, the quality of your video will significantly increase, and the time and work you put in will be evident.</p>
<h4 id="3-Change-Up-Your-Shots-3"><a href="#3-Change-Up-Your-Shots-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Change Up Your Shots"></a>3. Change Up Your Shots</h4><p>Rather than keeping your camera fixed, try varied angles while shooting. This may not work for all of your videos, but it is critical to keep your viewers engaged while they watch them, especially if you want them to stay until the finish and come back for more. Unless you’re talking about anything incredibly essential, sitting and listening to someone talk for more than 10 minutes without the camera moving will quickly become dull or old.</p>
<h4 id="4-Transitions-And-Effects-3"><a href="#4-Transitions-And-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Transitions And Effects"></a>4. Transitions And Effects</h4><p>When editing a video with numerous parts, the use of effects and transitions can considerably impact the overall quality of the video. Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmii is one of the greatest choices for Windows for beginners who wish to create video footage with templates automatically. Smart video templates, trendy filters and overlays, fun stickers and motion components, and, most importantly, advanced editing capabilities are all available.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> This is pretty much everything we’ve gathered to assist you in uploading 4K videos to YouTube. Do not become worried. Your 4K video will be in low resolution when you first publish it. This is due to YouTube’s high-resolution processing requiring time. It could take a few hours for your video to be available in 4K mode.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The duration, format, frame rate, and resolution of your video all affect the processing time for high-definition videos. If you don’t want your video to be seen unless it has a high-quality option, upload it as unlisted and then publish it once 4K resolution is available.</p>
