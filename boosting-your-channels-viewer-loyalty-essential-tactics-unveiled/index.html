<p>Audience retention is one of your most important stats on YouTube. It is even more important than your view count. Your view count really only tells you how many people are finding and clicking on your videos, not whether they are actually watching them. Audience retention refers to how much of a video a viewer watches before clicking away, which is very useful information to have. If you know when people are leaving your videos then you know what you need to work on.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Audience-Retention"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Audience Retention?"></a>Part 1: What is Audience Retention?</h2><p>To put it in simple terms, YouTube audience retention is about how much of each video your viewers watch. It’s usually expressed as a percentage, so if your viewer gets half way through, they will have a retention of 50 per cent.</p>
<p>For YouTube analytics, audience retention is taken as a mean of the retention figures for each of your viewers. For example, if you post a ten-minute video and half your viewers get to the five-minute mark, that’s a retention of 50 per cent. If the other half watch it right to the end, that’s a retention of 100 per cent. The mean of these two figures is 75 per cent, and that’s what YouTube will use as your audience retention figure.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This retention rate affects how highly your video is ranked on YouTube, with videos boasting higher audience retention rates appearing higher in the search results than those which do not. This is because both YouTube and Google are highly focussed on customer satisfaction, and a long watch time means a very happy customer was watching that video. For this reason, it’s well worth considering how to increase YouTube audience retention as it demonstrates that you’re making great content as well as helping you get more viewers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-See-Your-Audience-Retention-Report-in-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-See-Your-Audience-Retention-Report-in-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to See Your Audience Retention Report in YouTube?"></a>Part 2: How to See Your Audience Retention Report in YouTube?</h2><p>YouTube will produce reports to help you keep track of your audience retention. There are two types of audience retention reports; absolute and relative. Absolute allows you to view a graph of your video’s retention and see when people might be clicking away, or if they are skipping to later parts of your video. If you lose a lot of viewers in the first 15 seconds of your videos then that is a clear indication that your content is not what the viewers who find your videos really want. The relative report is where your video is compared to the average retention of similar videos.</p>
<p>Note that by ‘similar videos’, YouTube means videos of a similar length. There is no way to compare your videos only to other videos in your genre. The relative report will always be somewhat skewed because your videos will be measured against very different content.</p>
<p>To see an audience retention report log into your YouTube account and go to your<strong>Creator Studio</strong>. There, select<strong>Audience Retention</strong>under<strong>Analytics</strong>.</p>

Obviously 100 per cent is going to be the Holy Grail of retention rates, but how many videos are actually going to achieve that? It only takes for one person to ‘accidentally’ click on your video and rapidly click away, or for someone to have to stop for outside reasons, to drag your average down.</p>
<p>According to the YouTube community, a good goal to aim for is around 50 per cent, but as there is a lot which can affect your retention rate, that number may be different for you. Low view numbers sometimes get higher retention rates because it’s mainly subscribers watching, whereas channels with millions of views may suffer due to more people abandoning. Rather than setting yourself a golden number, focus instead on increasing your retention rate from wherever it is now, and celebrate your own success instead of measuring yourself against others.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention"><a href="#Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention"></a>Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention</h2><p>If you’re serious about learning how to increase YouTube audience retention, here are five of the best ideas for you:</p>
<h4 id="1-Compare-your-videos"><a href="#1-Compare-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Compare your videos"></a>1. Compare your videos</h4><p>Investigating your audience retention report will highlight the videos where you achieved maximum success. Think about what you did here, and work to replicate that technique. Perhaps you were talking about a product, or maybe your structured your video slightly differently. It’s up to you to dissect your video and find out what it was that kept people watching for longer, so that you can repeat this success in the future. You can also use some influencer marketing platform such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to take a look at the videos in your similar channels, and learn the popular videos on their channels.</p>
<h4 id="2-Get-on-with-it"><a href="#2-Get-on-with-it" class="headerlink" title="2. Get on with it"></a>2. Get on with it</h4><p>Research shows that YouTube viewers have an incredibly short attention span. Depending on who you believe, you could have as much as six seconds or as little as just three to grab their attention and compel them to carry on watching. If you want to improve your audience retention, coming in with an engaging, attention grabbing statement right at the start is crucial to your success. Nobody wants to waste their time watching someone waffle on for ages about their granny or their favorite hobbies, so get right down to it straight away, by telling them what’s in store.</p>
<h4 id="3-Make-it-visually-engaging"><a href="#3-Make-it-visually-engaging" class="headerlink" title="3. Make it visually engaging"></a>3. Make it visually engaging</h4><p>Perhaps all you’ve got is a presentation to make. You’re not a gamer, you’re not showing clips of your cat and you’re not doing a makeup tutorial, so surely all you need is a camera, good lighting and your face, right? Wrong. Viewers like to see the visual content changing, and videos which have a range of scenes are usually far more successful than those where it’s just a person talking to camera. Think about how you can insert cutaways, pop up text, different footage and other graphics to keep it interesting for your viewers.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-it-shorter"><a href="#4-Make-it-shorter" class="headerlink" title="4. Make it shorter"></a>4. Make it shorter</h4><p>This one is a no brainer really. If you make a one-minute video, how hard is it going to be to keep viewers watching to the end compared to a 20-minute marathon. However, going too short can be negative too, unless you really do have something very quick and simple to showcase. Long videos work well for YouTubers in the gaming niche, in particular, because viewers want to know the end result, but for most of us, these sorts of viewing statistics are hard to reach.</p>
<p>If you consider a viewer who watches three minutes of your content, would you rather they watched three minutes of a ten-minute video and then clicked away bored, or would you rather they finished an entire video that was only three minutes long? Both in terms of audience retention and of your own reputation, having a viewer finish a short video is much more valuable to you than losing someone half way through a long one. That person probably enjoyed your content to the end and will more than likely watch another one of your videos. Conversely, the one you lost half way through was bored enough to stop watching and will probably not bother viewing any other videos of yours in future.</p>
<h4 id="5-Keep-them-hooked"><a href="#5-Keep-them-hooked" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep them hooked"></a>5. Keep them hooked</h4><p>Think carefully about your YouTube video structure. Ideally, you will tell them at the very start that you’ve got something amazing to share with them later on. This could be a tip, a tutorial, a new product reveal or even something funny. Whatever it is, tell them they’re going to love it from the start, and keep reminding them to watch from the end to get this gift. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give them great content all the way through, just that you should save a carrot for the end of the ride to reward those loyal viewers.</p>
<p>So, now you know how to increase YouTube audience retention, what are you going to do about it? Have a go at modifying your videos to boost the numbers who will watch to the end and let us know how you got on.</p>
<h4 id="6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor"><a href="#6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="6. Use an Excellent Video Editor"></a>6. Use an Excellent Video Editor</h4><p>Content is the king. It is necessary to use a powerful video editor to help you edit videos. With an excellent video editor like Filmora, you can custom stunning videos effortlessly.</p>

For this reason, it’s well worth considering how to increase YouTube audience retention as it demonstrates that you’re making great content as well as helping you get more viewers.</p>

There are two types of audience retention reports; absolute and relative. Absolute allows you to view a graph of your video’s retention and see when people might be clicking away, or if they are skipping to later parts of your video. If you lose a lot of viewers in the first 15 seconds of your videos then that is a clear indication that your content is not what the viewers who find your videos really want. The relative report is where your video is compared to the average retention of similar videos.</p>
<p>Note that by ‘similar videos’, YouTube means videos of a similar length. There is no way to compare your videos only to other videos in your genre. The relative report will always be somewhat skewed because your videos will be measured against very different content.</p>

Obviously 100 per cent is going to be the Holy Grail of retention rates, but how many videos are actually going to achieve that? It only takes for one person to ‘accidentally’ click on your video and rapidly click away, or for someone to have to stop for outside reasons, to drag your average down.</p>
<p>According to the YouTube community, a good goal to aim for is around 50 per cent, but as there is a lot which can affect your retention rate, that number may be different for you. Low view numbers sometimes get higher retention rates because it’s mainly subscribers watching, whereas channels with millions of views may suffer due to more people abandoning. Rather than setting yourself a golden number, focus instead on increasing your retention rate from wherever it is now, and celebrate your own success instead of measuring yourself against others.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention-1"><a href="#Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention"></a>Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention</h2><p>If you’re serious about learning how to increase YouTube audience retention, here are five of the best ideas for you:</p>
<h4 id="1-Compare-your-videos-1"><a href="#1-Compare-your-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Compare your videos"></a>1. Compare your videos</h4><p>Investigating your audience retention report will highlight the videos where you achieved maximum success. Think about what you did here, and work to replicate that technique. Perhaps you were talking about a product, or maybe your structured your video slightly differently. It’s up to you to dissect your video and find out what it was that kept people watching for longer, so that you can repeat this success in the future. You can also use some influencer marketing platform such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to take a look at the videos in your similar channels, and learn the popular videos on their channels.</p>
<h4 id="2-Get-on-with-it-1"><a href="#2-Get-on-with-it-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Get on with it"></a>2. Get on with it</h4><p>Research shows that YouTube viewers have an incredibly short attention span. Depending on who you believe, you could have as much as six seconds or as little as just three to grab their attention and compel them to carry on watching. If you want to improve your audience retention, coming in with an engaging, attention grabbing statement right at the start is crucial to your success. Nobody wants to waste their time watching someone waffle on for ages about their granny or their favorite hobbies, so get right down to it straight away, by telling them what’s in store.</p>
<h4 id="3-Make-it-visually-engaging-1"><a href="#3-Make-it-visually-engaging-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Make it visually engaging"></a>3. Make it visually engaging</h4><p>Perhaps all you’ve got is a presentation to make. You’re not a gamer, you’re not showing clips of your cat and you’re not doing a makeup tutorial, so surely all you need is a camera, good lighting and your face, right? Wrong. Viewers like to see the visual content changing, and videos which have a range of scenes are usually far more successful than those where it’s just a person talking to camera. Think about how you can insert cutaways, pop up text, different footage and other graphics to keep it interesting for your viewers.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-it-shorter-1"><a href="#4-Make-it-shorter-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Make it shorter"></a>4. Make it shorter</h4><p>This one is a no brainer really. If you make a one-minute video, how hard is it going to be to keep viewers watching to the end compared to a 20-minute marathon. However, going too short can be negative too, unless you really do have something very quick and simple to showcase. Long videos work well for YouTubers in the gaming niche, in particular, because viewers want to know the end result, but for most of us, these sorts of viewing statistics are hard to reach.</p>
<p>If you consider a viewer who watches three minutes of your content, would you rather they watched three minutes of a ten-minute video and then clicked away bored, or would you rather they finished an entire video that was only three minutes long? Both in terms of audience retention and of your own reputation, having a viewer finish a short video is much more valuable to you than losing someone half way through a long one. That person probably enjoyed your content to the end and will more than likely watch another one of your videos. Conversely, the one you lost half way through was bored enough to stop watching and will probably not bother viewing any other videos of yours in future.</p>
<h4 id="5-Keep-them-hooked-1"><a href="#5-Keep-them-hooked-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep them hooked"></a>5. Keep them hooked</h4><p>Think carefully about your YouTube video structure. Ideally, you will tell them at the very start that you’ve got something amazing to share with them later on. This could be a tip, a tutorial, a new product reveal or even something funny. Whatever it is, tell them they’re going to love it from the start, and keep reminding them to watch from the end to get this gift. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give them great content all the way through, just that you should save a carrot for the end of the ride to reward those loyal viewers.</p>
<p>So, now you know how to increase YouTube audience retention, what are you going to do about it? Have a go at modifying your videos to boost the numbers who will watch to the end and let us know how you got on.</p>
<h4 id="6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Use an Excellent Video Editor"></a>6. Use an Excellent Video Editor</h4><p>Content is the king. It is necessary to use a powerful video editor to help you edit videos. With an excellent video editor like Filmora, you can custom stunning videos effortlessly.</p>

<p>Audience retention is one of your most important stats on YouTube. It is even more important than your view count. Your view count really only tells you how many people are finding and clicking on your videos, not whether they are actually watching them. Audience retention refers to how much of a video a viewer watches before clicking away, which is very useful information to have. If you know when people are leaving your videos then you know what you need to work on.</p>

It’s usually expressed as a percentage, so if your viewer gets half way through, they will have a retention of 50 per cent.</p>
<p>For YouTube analytics, audience retention is taken as a mean of the retention figures for each of your viewers. For example, if you post a ten-minute video and half your viewers get to the five-minute mark, that’s a retention of 50 per cent. If the other half watch it right to the end, that’s a retention of 100 per cent. The mean of these two figures is 75 per cent, and that’s what YouTube will use as your audience retention figure.</p>

It only takes for one person to ‘accidentally’ click on your video and rapidly click away, or for someone to have to stop for outside reasons, to drag your average down.</p>
<p>According to the YouTube community, a good goal to aim for is around 50 per cent, but as there is a lot which can affect your retention rate, that number may be different for you. Low view numbers sometimes get higher retention rates because it’s mainly subscribers watching, whereas channels with millions of views may suffer due to more people abandoning. Rather than setting yourself a golden number, focus instead on increasing your retention rate from wherever it is now, and celebrate your own success instead of measuring yourself against others.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention-3"><a href="#Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention"></a>Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention</h2><p>If you’re serious about learning how to increase YouTube audience retention, here are five of the best ideas for you:</p>
<h4 id="1-Compare-your-videos-3"><a href="#1-Compare-your-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Compare your videos"></a>1. Compare your videos</h4><p>Investigating your audience retention report will highlight the videos where you achieved maximum success. Think about what you did here, and work to replicate that technique. Perhaps you were talking about a product, or maybe your structured your video slightly differently. It’s up to you to dissect your video and find out what it was that kept people watching for longer, so that you can repeat this success in the future. You can also use some influencer marketing platform such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to take a look at the videos in your similar channels, and learn the popular videos on their channels.</p>
<h4 id="2-Get-on-with-it-3"><a href="#2-Get-on-with-it-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Get on with it"></a>2. Get on with it</h4><p>Research shows that YouTube viewers have an incredibly short attention span. Depending on who you believe, you could have as much as six seconds or as little as just three to grab their attention and compel them to carry on watching. If you want to improve your audience retention, coming in with an engaging, attention grabbing statement right at the start is crucial to your success. Nobody wants to waste their time watching someone waffle on for ages about their granny or their favorite hobbies, so get right down to it straight away, by telling them what’s in store.</p>
<h4 id="3-Make-it-visually-engaging-3"><a href="#3-Make-it-visually-engaging-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Make it visually engaging"></a>3. Make it visually engaging</h4><p>Perhaps all you’ve got is a presentation to make. You’re not a gamer, you’re not showing clips of your cat and you’re not doing a makeup tutorial, so surely all you need is a camera, good lighting and your face, right? Wrong. Viewers like to see the visual content changing, and videos which have a range of scenes are usually far more successful than those where it’s just a person talking to camera. Think about how you can insert cutaways, pop up text, different footage and other graphics to keep it interesting for your viewers.</p>
<h4 id="4-Make-it-shorter-3"><a href="#4-Make-it-shorter-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Make it shorter"></a>4. Make it shorter</h4><p>This one is a no brainer really. If you make a one-minute video, how hard is it going to be to keep viewers watching to the end compared to a 20-minute marathon. However, going too short can be negative too, unless you really do have something very quick and simple to showcase. Long videos work well for YouTubers in the gaming niche, in particular, because viewers want to know the end result, but for most of us, these sorts of viewing statistics are hard to reach.</p>
<p>If you consider a viewer who watches three minutes of your content, would you rather they watched three minutes of a ten-minute video and then clicked away bored, or would you rather they finished an entire video that was only three minutes long? Both in terms of audience retention and of your own reputation, having a viewer finish a short video is much more valuable to you than losing someone half way through a long one. That person probably enjoyed your content to the end and will more than likely watch another one of your videos. Conversely, the one you lost half way through was bored enough to stop watching and will probably not bother viewing any other videos of yours in future.</p>
<h4 id="5-Keep-them-hooked-3"><a href="#5-Keep-them-hooked-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep them hooked"></a>5. Keep them hooked</h4><p>Think carefully about your YouTube video structure. Ideally, you will tell them at the very start that you’ve got something amazing to share with them later on. This could be a tip, a tutorial, a new product reveal or even something funny. Whatever it is, tell them they’re going to love it from the start, and keep reminding them to watch from the end to get this gift. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give them great content all the way through, just that you should save a carrot for the end of the ride to reward those loyal viewers.</p>
<p>So, now you know how to increase YouTube audience retention, what are you going to do about it? Have a go at modifying your videos to boost the numbers who will watch to the end and let us know how you got on.</p>
<h4 id="6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Use an Excellent Video Editor"></a>6. Use an Excellent Video Editor</h4><p>Content is the king. It is necessary to use a powerful video editor to help you edit videos. With an excellent video editor like Filmora, you can custom stunning videos effortlessly.</p>

<p>From hardcore gamers to anybody who likes watching adults freak out about zombies, a lot of people really enjoy gaming vlogs. YouTube gamers are among some of the most popular vloggers on YouTube. To be a successful YouTube gamer you need have both gaming skills and a great vlogging presence.</p>
<p>Posting a cool gaming videos once in a while for your friends is fun, and if that is all you want to do then the first tip on this list should help you out. If you are hoping to build a popular YouTube channel centered on gaming then you will want to read further. Gaming vlogs are more than just hobbies for successful YouTube gamers. They put a lot of work into them.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know about being a gaming vlogger is that gameplay footage is protected by copyright. Some game creators will allow for the use of this footage in gaming vlogs because it helps promote their games, but others see these videos as competition for their games. There will usually be information on the manufacturer’s website, often in the ‘Terms of Use’ section, which explains their policy. If you have questions about it, or want permission to use footage from a game you are not allowed to, you should ask. There are YouTube gamers posting videos of games the copyright does not allow them to who have gotten special permission, although this is more likely to be given if your channel is already popular.</p>

<p>&lt;2&gt; Four tips for YouTube gamers:</p>
<h4 id="1-Equipment"><a href="#1-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="1. Equipment"></a>1. Equipment</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gamer-elgato.JPG"
                      alt="gamer elgato"
                ></p>
<p>For some types of vlogs, beauty vlogs for example, the camera is the most important piece of equipment. For a YouTube gamer the most important piece of equipment is a game recorder, such as the Elgato Game Capture featured above. The Elgato Game Capture costs about $150 online, which is a typical price for a quality game recorder. Most of the footage you record is going to be from inside your games, so a game recorder is a must. Nobody wants to watch footage recorded from a camera pointing at your tv screen.</p>
<p>You will need a camera if you want to record reaction videos, which you probably will if you are going to be playing horror games where your reactions enhance the viewing experience. You do not need to record a reaction video for every game you play, though. So, it is not necessary for you to pay upwards of $1000 on a DSLR for your gaming channel. A good webcam will do, or you could even use your phone’s camera.</p>
<p>Aside from your game play the most important thing you will be recording is audio. It is worth investing in an external microphone. Since you do not need to worry about the range of your microphone for a gaming vlog something like the Blue Snowball USB mic is a great choice. These cost about $50 online. LAV mics are also popular among vloggers because they can be clipped onto your shirt while you record. An entire Lavalier system can cost over $100, sometimes around $600, but it is less expensive to buy a single LAV mic that plugs into the audio jack of your phone or computer.</p>
<p>If you cannot afford to invest in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >an external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you should download a free audio editing program called Audacity from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacityteam.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can use Audacity to improve the quality of the sound you record using your computer or camera.</p>
<h4 id="2-Developing-Your-Voice"><a href="#2-Developing-Your-Voice" class="headerlink" title="2. Developing Your Voice"></a>2. Developing Your Voice</h4><p>The reason a lot of people will want to watch your gaming videos while they could be watching someone else’s is not because you are a great gamer. It is because you are a great entertainer. Your vlogging voice should be a lot like a DJ’s radio voice; clear, confident, and louder than you would ever be at the dinner table. People do not tend to actually talk in the same voice they vlog in and YouTube gamers are no exception.</p>
<p>Forcing yourself into a fake voice is awkward, though, and while your vlogging voice is something you will need to develop it should not be fake. Remember to speak up and focus on your games. Some of your best commentary will happen while you are completely absorbed in what you are doing. Talking while you game and sounding natural will not happen right away, but it will with practice. When you start getting comments on your videos keep that feedback in mind and try to work the kinds of things your viewers like into your gaming voiceovers more often.</p>
<h4 id="3-Time-Management"><a href="#3-Time-Management" class="headerlink" title="3. Time Management"></a>3. Time Management</h4><p>Recording a gaming video you are happy with takes time. Editing that video can also take up a lot of time, depending on the style of video you want to post. These are the time commitments that most people expect to have when starting a gaming channel, but they are not the only ones.</p>
<p>Initially, you will need to spend a lot of time thinking about what kind of gaming channel you want to run. Are you more focused on game reviews, or on comedy? You will also need to consider whether your target audience consists of serious gamers who are looking for something informative or casual gamers – perhaps even non-gamers – who just want to watch entertaining YouTube videos. The answers to these questions will lead you to building your brand, which can also be time consuming. You will need channel art – like an icon and a banner – as well as intro and outro sequences. Plan to think about and create these things early or you will end up getting busy and rushing through them.</p>
<p>The other things related to your gaming channel which will be taking up your time are: researching gaming trends, networking with other YouTube gamers, and promoting your channel. You need to plan out times for these activities, as well as time limits. These are the things that can eat up all of your personal time if you let them.</p>
<h4 id="4-Channel-Promotion"><a href="#4-Channel-Promotion" class="headerlink" title="4. Channel Promotion"></a>4. Channel Promotion</h4><p>In order to start getting more views and subscribers you will need to promote your channel. Part of this is having searchable video titles and descriptions, but you also need to get involved with the communities surrounding the games you are playing. These communities are more likely to want to watch your videos if you are a part of them.</p>
<p>Besides creating your own gaming videos you will need to watch other people’s and reach out to these gamers through comments. If you find another YouTube gamer with close to your same number of subscribers then you may even want to approach them about collaboration. This is one way you can promote your channel; by introducing yourself to the other gamer’s subscribers and allowing them to be introduced to yours. You will also need to put time into being active in gaming forums and communities in order to show people you know what you are doing and tell them about your channel.</p>
<p>You should not use the comments sections of other people’s videos, or gaming forums, just to promote your own channel. You can and should promote your channel through these mediums, it just cannot seem like self-interest is the only reason you are bothering. When you comment on another gamer’s video actually say something that gamer might want to respond to, not just ‘I did a video like this too, check it out!’. It is the same when you start getting involved with gaming forums. You need to participate in conversations and take an interest in people if you want them to take an interest in you and your work.</p>

<p>From hardcore gamers to anybody who likes watching adults freak out about zombies, a lot of people really enjoy gaming vlogs. YouTube gamers are among some of the most popular vloggers on YouTube. To be a successful YouTube gamer you need have both gaming skills and a great vlogging presence.</p>
<p>Posting a cool gaming videos once in a while for your friends is fun, and if that is all you want to do then the first tip on this list should help you out. If you are hoping to build a popular YouTube channel centered on gaming then you will want to read further. Gaming vlogs are more than just hobbies for successful YouTube gamers. They put a lot of work into them.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know about being a gaming vlogger is that gameplay footage is protected by copyright. Some game creators will allow for the use of this footage in gaming vlogs because it helps promote their games, but others see these videos as competition for their games. There will usually be information on the manufacturer’s website, often in the ‘Terms of Use’ section, which explains their policy. If you have questions about it, or want permission to use footage from a game you are not allowed to, you should ask. There are YouTube gamers posting videos of games the copyright does not allow them to who have gotten special permission, although this is more likely to be given if your channel is already popular.</p>

<p>Looking for a good video editor for your gaming video? Wondershare Filmora is recommended. It is not just a video editor which allows you to cut, split, add text, apply background sound to your video clips, but also a screen recorder which helps you record videos from PC screem webcam, and voice over. What’s more, you can find lots of special effects for gaming in this software.</p>

<p>&lt;2&gt; Four tips for YouTube gamers:</p>
<h4 id="1-Equipment-2"><a href="#1-Equipment-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Equipment"></a>1. Equipment</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gamer-elgato.JPG"
                      alt="gamer elgato"
                ></p>
<p>For some types of vlogs, beauty vlogs for example, the camera is the most important piece of equipment. For a YouTube gamer the most important piece of equipment is a game recorder, such as the Elgato Game Capture featured above. The Elgato Game Capture costs about $150 online, which is a typical price for a quality game recorder. Most of the footage you record is going to be from inside your games, so a game recorder is a must. Nobody wants to watch footage recorded from a camera pointing at your tv screen.</p>
<p>You will need a camera if you want to record reaction videos, which you probably will if you are going to be playing horror games where your reactions enhance the viewing experience. You do not need to record a reaction video for every game you play, though. So, it is not necessary for you to pay upwards of $1000 on a DSLR for your gaming channel. A good webcam will do, or you could even use your phone’s camera.</p>
<p>Aside from your game play the most important thing you will be recording is audio. It is worth investing in an external microphone. Since you do not need to worry about the range of your microphone for a gaming vlog something like the Blue Snowball USB mic is a great choice. These cost about $50 online. LAV mics are also popular among vloggers because they can be clipped onto your shirt while you record. An entire Lavalier system can cost over $100, sometimes around $600, but it is less expensive to buy a single LAV mic that plugs into the audio jack of your phone or computer.</p>
<p>If you cannot afford to invest in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >an external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you should download a free audio editing program called Audacity from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacityteam.org <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You can use Audacity to improve the quality of the sound you record using your computer or camera.</p>
<h4 id="2-Developing-Your-Voice-2"><a href="#2-Developing-Your-Voice-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Developing Your Voice"></a>2. Developing Your Voice</h4><p>The reason a lot of people will want to watch your gaming videos while they could be watching someone else’s is not because you are a great gamer. It is because you are a great entertainer. Your vlogging voice should be a lot like a DJ’s radio voice; clear, confident, and louder than you would ever be at the dinner table. People do not tend to actually talk in the same voice they vlog in and YouTube gamers are no exception.</p>
<p>Forcing yourself into a fake voice is awkward, though, and while your vlogging voice is something you will need to develop it should not be fake. Remember to speak up and focus on your games. Some of your best commentary will happen while you are completely absorbed in what you are doing. Talking while you game and sounding natural will not happen right away, but it will with practice. When you start getting comments on your videos keep that feedback in mind and try to work the kinds of things your viewers like into your gaming voiceovers more often.</p>
<h4 id="3-Time-Management-2"><a href="#3-Time-Management-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Time Management"></a>3. Time Management</h4><p>Recording a gaming video you are happy with takes time. Editing that video can also take up a lot of time, depending on the style of video you want to post. These are the time commitments that most people expect to have when starting a gaming channel, but they are not the only ones.</p>
<p>Initially, you will need to spend a lot of time thinking about what kind of gaming channel you want to run. Are you more focused on game reviews, or on comedy? You will also need to consider whether your target audience consists of serious gamers who are looking for something informative or casual gamers – perhaps even non-gamers – who just want to watch entertaining YouTube videos. The answers to these questions will lead you to building your brand, which can also be time consuming. You will need channel art – like an icon and a banner – as well as intro and outro sequences. Plan to think about and create these things early or you will end up getting busy and rushing through them.</p>
<p>The other things related to your gaming channel which will be taking up your time are: researching gaming trends, networking with other YouTube gamers, and promoting your channel. You need to plan out times for these activities, as well as time limits. These are the things that can eat up all of your personal time if you let them.</p>
<h4 id="4-Channel-Promotion-2"><a href="#4-Channel-Promotion-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Channel Promotion"></a>4. Channel Promotion</h4><p>In order to start getting more views and subscribers you will need to promote your channel. Part of this is having searchable video titles and descriptions, but you also need to get involved with the communities surrounding the games you are playing. These communities are more likely to want to watch your videos if you are a part of them.</p>
<p>Besides creating your own gaming videos you will need to watch other people’s and reach out to these gamers through comments. If you find another YouTube gamer with close to your same number of subscribers then you may even want to approach them about collaboration. This is one way you can promote your channel; by introducing yourself to the other gamer’s subscribers and allowing them to be introduced to yours. You will also need to put time into being active in gaming forums and communities in order to show people you know what you are doing and tell them about your channel.</p>
<p>You should not use the comments sections of other people’s videos, or gaming forums, just to promote your own channel. You can and should promote your channel through these mediums, it just cannot seem like self-interest is the only reason you are bothering. When you comment on another gamer’s video actually say something that gamer might want to respond to, not just ‘I did a video like this too, check it out!’. It is the same when you start getting involved with gaming forums. You need to participate in conversations and take an interest in people if you want them to take an interest in you and your work.</p>
