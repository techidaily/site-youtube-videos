You make your original content, so it might not be obvious why you would want stock footage. Stock footage doesn’t replace your own recorded videos, though, it just supplements them by adding a bit of variety. Stock video footage is especially useful for things like intros and transitions.

Here are 4 YouTube channels where you can find free stock footage. To learn how to download videos directly from YouTube, check out the tutorial **[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

**Royalty-free Video Footage:**

[1\. Free Stock Footage Archive](#freestockfootage)

[2\. Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](#beachfront)

[3\. HDStockFootageFree](#hdstock)

[4\. NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](#natureclip)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **1\. [Free Stock Footage Archive](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy8fgmCsEDIKMWx4Zi0CvNQ/featured)**

This channel has a massive library of free stock footage, which is updated semi-regularly. They have backgrounds, ‘glitch’ effects (which look really cool when combined with [Filmora’s green screen tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)), and more classic stock footage options like street scenes and forests. There’s a particularly interesting playlist of black and white videos, which could be useful if you’re trying to make a darker or creepier project.

Besides video footage, this archive also has some sound effects.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **2\. [Beachfront B-Roll: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/Beachfrontprod/featured)**

This stock footage channel has lots of nature scenes and wildlife. There’s some urban and technology stuff too, but their nature stuff is especially great. It’s easy to find what you’re looking for on Beachfront B-Roll because they have themed playlists for different seasons, as well as for things like ‘sky’ or ‘water’.

On their **[website](http://www.beachfrontbroll.com/)**, you can find even more content and multiple download options.

## **3\. [HDStockFootageFree](https://www.youtube.com/user/HDStockFootageFree)**

This channel doesn’t have a large variety of different kinds of footage – all of it is pretty industrial. There’s footage of trains, trucks, trash, and people working. It’s the kind of stuff that you might not find on other stock footage channels because it’s not necessarily pretty.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **4\. [NatureClip: Free Stock Footage](https://www.youtube.com/user/NatureClip)**

The name of this channel pretty much says it all. They’ve got tons of great nature videos, including scenery, animals, flowers, and views. It’s not all everyday nature either, they’ve got cool macro shots of bugs, and a lot of more exotic animals. One particularly noteworthy playlist is devoted entirely to slow-motion clips.

If you know of anywhere else, people can get free stock footage, say so in the comments!

If you want to find a video editing solution that empowers your imagination and creativity yet takes less effort, please try this robust and user-friendly video editing software **Wondershare Filmora**. It provides special effects, stock photo & video, sound library, etc., which will definitely enhance your productivity and helps to make money by making videos much accessible.

## How to Post YouTube video on Facebook?

Since Facebook is easily accessible, many users have more access to it than other social media platforms. More so, the page allows you to communicate with your audience via photos, videos, graphics, text, among many other multimedia contents. You don’t even need any programming skills to operate it. Here are ways to post YouTube content to Facebook.

#### How to share a YouTube video on Facebook using a computer

If you have a stationary point of work, i.e., a computer, it is possible to share your YouTube video through it.

Step 1\. First, visit the YouTube site at <https://www.youtube.com>. It can launch from any web browser.

Step 2\. Choose from among your videos on YouTube the one you wish to share on Facebook.

Step 3\. Then find the “Share” icon located directly under the video you want to share. Click on the video and hit the “Share” button below the video.

Step 4\. Choose “Facebook” from the sharing options that pop up.

Step 5\. Next, sign in to “Facebook” on your desktop. Then select the destination point you want your video to land in by using the drop-down menu at the top of your desktop screen. Select the “Share to News Feed” or perhaps the share to “Story.”

Step 6\. Finally, click the “Post to Facebook” tab to share your YouTube content with Facebook.

#### How to share a YouTube video on Facebook using a mobile device

Are you on the go and want your Facebook fans to know what content you have on your YouTube channel? Here are the simple steps on how to post a YouTube video on Facebook right from the palm of your hands – a mobile device.

Step 2\. Peruse through your YouTube videos and choose the one you wish to share on Facebook.

Step 3\. Check below the video and click on the “Share” icon.

Step 4\. Search through the app’s options and choose Facebook. Also, ensure that the “Facebook” app is installed on your mobile device to make your videos sharable.

Step 5\. Click on the “Next” option in the upper right-hand corner of your mobile screen. It will enable video sharing.
