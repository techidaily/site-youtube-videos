## Part 1: The rules to know for each means earning money from YouTube

As a YouTube creator, finding ways to earn money from your content cannot be easy. Some creators make a living solely off their channels. Others supplement their income with affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and ad revenue. But if you want to earn money from YouTube truly, you need to understand which monetization methods work best for you and your content.

Here's what you should know when using each method and why you should consider doing so:

| **Methods**                                        | **Viewers/Clicks/Impressions**                                     | **Earnings/Commission**                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **YouTube Ads $1 CPM**                             | 1 million Ad views                                                 | Average rate per ad=0.18Total \~ $5000 |

| **Affiliate Marketing 30%-35% commission**         | If 100 people buys $20 product through affiliate link. Total $2000 | $2000\*35%= $700                       |
| **Crowdfunding (Patreon, Indiegogo, GoFundMe) $5** | 100 subscribers funds the channel                                  | 100\*5=$500                            |
| **Merchandise Shelf $5 Shirt**                     | 100 subscribers purchases your merch                               | 100\*5=$500                            |

### YouTube Ads

The video ads on the platform aren't lucrative and can be used to supplement your income in the form of AdSense earnings. An actual advertiser pays 0.18 per ad view on average (as shown above). That means 1000 ad views equals $18 and $3-$5 per 1000 views.

### Brand Sponsorships

Brands can sponsor your videos to reach their target audience. YouTube videos are a big part of our lives, and brands are becoming increasingly aware of how useful these videos can be. To be eligible for sponsorship, your channel must be of 5000 subscribers.

### Affiliate Marketing

YouTubers help brands increase sales by encouraging their viewers to shop at the company's store or visit its specific product pages. They then earn a commission (30%-35%) on products that people buy after clicking an affiliate link.

### Crowdfunding

Today many people use crowdfunding websites to raise money for personal, channel-related projects. Most YouTubers are doing it to generate steady cash flow. Some of them use this source to fund their YouTube videos so that it increases quality and engagement.

### Merchandise Shelf

Your merchandise represents and feeds your audience's connection with you. Your product is your business, so you're first and foremost an entrepreneur. Then design your YouTube marketing strategy to sell your merchandise and generate income.

### Channel Membership

YouTube has a plan that allows you to charge your subscribers for membership on your YouTube channel. Members get access to exclusive live chats, badges, emojis, etc. Subscribers must give a set amount every month to a channel that makes a steady monthly income for YouTubers.

## Part 4: How much money can you make on YouTube?

The answer to that question can vary widely depending on the type of content you produce and the demographics of your target market. However, we've found that a single video ad can be worth anywhere from around $100 to $5,000.

It's safe to say that most YouTubers earn between $1,000 and $10,000 per month from their ads alone. But there are many other factors to take into consideration when calculating the money, you can make on YouTube:

### The number of views your videos get

The key to making money from videos on YouTube is views. The more views you have, the more chance of getting paid will increase. So you need to create videos that will get viewers to click.

According to _Forbes's_ estimation, you can make $3-$5 per 1000 views. e.g., a video with 1,000,000 views can make around $5,000 on views only.

### The engagement level of your audience

When building a YouTube channel, the key to success lies in engaging with your audience. After all, if they don't like what you're offering, they will not watch your videos. So you've got to have a message that resonates and is useful.

### Your channel type

The YouTube algorithm is set up to favor channels with a high volume of views per video and high-quality content rather than low-quality channels that generate a lot of traffic but don't produce quality videos. So, if you want to increase your revenue from your YouTube videos, try to focus on high-quality content.

### Your monetization method

Several monetization methods exist, including Subscription, advertising, affiliate marketing, paid search, and sponsorships. Each monetization method requires a slightly different setup and management, resulting in different revenue.

### The country you are in

It is important to know that in some countries, making money off YouTube is extremely difficult. For example, in certain countries, monetizing your videos is impossible without using illegal methods, which will get you into legal trouble.

Some other factors, e.g., it's worth comparing the RPM of your country and other countries, different rules and prices of YouTube Ads depending on your country.

## Part 4: How much money can you make on YouTube?

The answer to that question can vary widely depending on the type of content you produce and the demographics of your target market. However, we've found that a single video ad can be worth anywhere from around $100 to $5,000.

It's safe to say that most YouTubers earn between $1,000 and $10,000 per month from their ads alone. But there are many other factors to take into consideration when calculating the money, you can make on YouTube:

### The number of views your videos get

The key to making money from videos on YouTube is views. The more views you have, the more chance of getting paid will increase. So you need to create videos that will get viewers to click.

According to _Forbes's_ estimation, you can make $3-$5 per 1000 views. e.g., a video with 1,000,000 views can make around $5,000 on views only.

### The engagement level of your audience

When building a YouTube channel, the key to success lies in engaging with your audience. After all, if they don't like what you're offering, they will not watch your videos. So you've got to have a message that resonates and is useful.

### Your channel type

The YouTube algorithm is set up to favor channels with a high volume of views per video and high-quality content rather than low-quality channels that generate a lot of traffic but don't produce quality videos. So, if you want to increase your revenue from your YouTube videos, try to focus on high-quality content.

### Your monetization method

Several monetization methods exist, including Subscription, advertising, affiliate marketing, paid search, and sponsorships. Each monetization method requires a slightly different setup and management, resulting in different revenue.

### The country you are in

It is important to know that in some countries, making money off YouTube is extremely difficult. For example, in certain countries, monetizing your videos is impossible without using illegal methods, which will get you into legal trouble.

Some other factors, e.g., it's worth comparing the RPM of your country and other countries, different rules and prices of YouTube Ads depending on your country.

For instance, you can edit the text titles using three different fill types: color fill, gradient fill, and image fill.

Wondershare Filmora is an excellent tool to help bring your thumbnails alive and reel the masses in to view more videos from your channel. You cannot possibly exhaust the 107 animation styles, 12 types of shadow effects, and more than ten borders that make your text stand out from the rest. If you are unhappy with your current font, you can choose from over 30 categories of titles till you find one that tickles your fancy.

We couldn't forget to mention the 3D titles feature with Wondershare Filmora. Gone are the days when creators would use 2D titles to introduce their videos to their audience.

Ensure you peruse through the various categories and find one that speaks to you and fits the kind of content you create.

## Conclusion

As you generate thumbnails for your YouTube videos, it would be wise to ensure you make them full-sized. The ideal dimension for a YouTube thumbnail should be 1280\*720\. Since most of your viewers use their mobile phones to watch YouTube videos, it would help to ensure the thumbnail looks the same on your laptop and your mobile device.

A hazy or pixelated thumbnail could discourage the viewer from clicking on your video. We hope you have found a font you like and will incorporate it into your next YouTube video.
