<p>As a YouTuber, you know those famous metrics: Views, Subscribers, and Watch Time. Those YouTube analytics are easy to understand. But YouTube offers much more data.</p>
<p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p>

<p>When you enter your YouTube Creator Studio, you will find the Analytics Tab on the left-hand-side menu. Click into it and you will see a whole list of features, each linking to its own dashboard.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="youtube-creator-sutdio"
                ></p>
<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p>
<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h4 id="Personalize-Your-Overview"><a href="#Personalize-Your-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Personalize Your Overview"></a><strong>Personalize Your Overview</strong></h4><p>By default, the dashboard will show you the stats from the last 28 days, but you can personalize the time frame to see the data of that specific period.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/data-of-specific-period.jpg"
                      alt="data-of-specific-period"
                ></p>
<p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="data-of-specific-region"
                >  </p>
<p>Note: You will be able to change the time frame and region for all the data within YouTube Analytics.</p>
<h4 id="See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview"><a href="#See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview" class="headerlink" title="See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview"></a><strong>See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard highlights your Top 10 videos. Right away you can see the Watch Time, Views, and Estimated Revenue of those high performing videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h4 id="Get-Insights-On-Your-Audience-In-Overview"><a href="#Get-Insights-On-Your-Audience-In-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Get Insights On Your Audience In Overview"></a><strong>Get Insights On Your Audience In Overview</strong></h4><p>In Overview you can see where the majority of your audience is from, what gender they are, how they are discovering your videos in Traffic Source, and where they are watching your video in Playback Locations:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Overview Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Overview Dashboard</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard is your mission control. I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>
<p><strong>2. Realtime</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel"><a href="#See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="See The Performance of Your Channel"></a><strong>See The Performance of Your Channel</strong></h4><p>The Realtime report is a fantastic tool for seeing the immediate performance of your channel, which automatically updates every 10 seconds. There are two main views: The last 48 hours and the Last 60 Minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                >  </p>
<h4 id="See-Performance-of-Your-25-Most-Recently-Published-Videos"><a href="#See-Performance-of-Your-25-Most-Recently-Published-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See Performance of Your 25 Most Recently Published Videos"></a><strong>See Performance of Your 25 Most Recently Published Videos</strong></h4><p>In the Realtime dashboard, you will see the last 48 hours and last 60-minute performance of your 25 most recently published videos.</p>
<p>If you have recently shared a new video, you should log into the Realtime dashboard to get a quick glance at the performance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/most-recently-published-videos.jpg"
                      alt="most-recently-published-videos"
                >  </p>
<h4 id="See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment"><a href="#See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment" class="headerlink" title="See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment"></a><strong>See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment</strong></h4><p>If you want to find out how many people have viewed your videos from a mobile device or how big your audience currently is, you can do that in the Realtime report.</p>
<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Realtime Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Realtime Dashboard</strong></h4><p>If YouTube sees that your recently published video is performing well right off the bat, then it will give your video a better chance of trending, ranking higher in search, and reaching more viewers.</p>
<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Revenue</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Much-Money-Your-Channel-Has-Made"><a href="#See-How-Much-Money-Your-Channel-Has-Made" class="headerlink" title="See How Much Money Your Channel Has Made"></a><strong>See How Much Money Your Channel Has Made</strong></h4><p>Select a specific timeline and see how much your channel has made from ads and YouTube Red viewers during that duration.</p>
<p>There are 3 ways to change the timeline:</p>

                >  </p>
<p>You can also change how you view your data, whether Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc. This way you can see exactly how much you made each day, week, or month, and determine if you can correlate a particular dip or spike to an event that occurred.</p>

<h4 id="Identify-Your-Highest-Earning-Videos"><a href="#Identify-Your-Highest-Earning-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Identify Your Highest Earning Videos"></a><strong>Identify Your Highest Earning Videos</strong></h4><p>In the Revenue report, you can see which videos are earning you the most. Consider how these videos are successful:</p>
<p>- Was the content great?</p>
<p>- Was it the perfect length?</p>
<p>- Was it a well-structured video?</p>
<p>- Was the video’s pacing fast?</p>
<p> Once you’ve done a full evaluation, see if you can apply it to your other videos.</p>

Click into Geography and see how much you are making in different countries and consider which audience is best to focus your attention on with the intention of increasing revenue.</p>
<h4 id="Compare-Estimated-Revenue-Earning-to-Other-Metrics"><a href="#Compare-Estimated-Revenue-Earning-to-Other-Metrics" class="headerlink" title="Compare Estimated Revenue Earning to Other Metrics"></a><strong>Compare Estimated Revenue Earning to Other Metrics</strong></h4><p>Know more about how your data are related by comparing to see if Revenue is affected by the performance of metrics in other categories such as Views. Does a rise in view change your revenue?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ad Rates</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understanding the Ad Rates Report</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="the-ad-rates-report"
                >  </p>
<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>
<h4 id="See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue"><a href="#See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue"></a><strong>See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue</strong></h4><p>Unlike the Revenue dashboard, the Ad Rates report dives deeper into the performance of individual monetized videos.</p>
<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

<p>You can see these details from the channel level or from an individual video level.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h4 id="How-to-Use-Ad-Rates-Report"><a href="#How-to-Use-Ad-Rates-Report" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Ad Rates Report"></a><strong>How to Use Ad Rates Report</strong></h4><p>Ad performance might not be something you think about at the early stages. You want to make videos, and not worry too much about ads, after all.</p>
<p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p>
<p><strong>5. Watch Time</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-The-Aggregated-Time-Your-Viewers-Spent-Watching-Your-Videos"><a href="#See-The-Aggregated-Time-Your-Viewers-Spent-Watching-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See The Aggregated Time Your Viewers Spent Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See The Aggregated Time Your Viewers Spent Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>YouTube puts a lot of weight on this metric because they know that the more time people spend watching your original content, the more time they will have to show ads to your audience. Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>
<p><img

                >  </p>
<p>In the graph, you will also be able to see the combined Views of all your videos, as well as the segmented performance of YouTube Red viewers.</p>
<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>

<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>

<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>

<p>For example, if you see an increase in viewers from Brazil, do a quick translation of your transcript and upload the Portuguese subtitles and see if it increases viewers.</p>

<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-1"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p>
<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>

<h4 id="Personalize-Your-Overview-1"><a href="#Personalize-Your-Overview-1" class="headerlink" title="Personalize Your Overview"></a><strong>Personalize Your Overview</strong></h4><p>By default, the dashboard will show you the stats from the last 28 days, but you can personalize the time frame to see the data of that specific period.</p>

                      alt="data-of-specific-period"
                ></p>
<p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Note: You will be able to change the time frame and region for all the data within YouTube Analytics.</p>
<h4 id="See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview-1"><a href="#See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview-1" class="headerlink" title="See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview"></a><strong>See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard highlights your Top 10 videos. Right away you can see the Watch Time, Views, and Estimated Revenue of those high performing videos.</p>

I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>
<p><strong>2. Realtime</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel-1"><a href="#See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="See The Performance of Your Channel"></a><strong>See The Performance of Your Channel</strong></h4><p>The Realtime report is a fantastic tool for seeing the immediate performance of your channel, which automatically updates every 10 seconds. There are two main views: The last 48 hours and the Last 60 Minutes.</p>

<p>If you have recently shared a new video, you should log into the Realtime dashboard to get a quick glance at the performance.</p>
<p><img

<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard-1"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Realtime Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Realtime Dashboard</strong></h4><p>If YouTube sees that your recently published video is performing well right off the bat, then it will give your video a better chance of trending, ranking higher in search, and reaching more viewers.</p>
<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Revenue</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Much-Money-Your-Channel-Has-Made-1"><a href="#See-How-Much-Money-Your-Channel-Has-Made-1" class="headerlink" title="See How Much Money Your Channel Has Made"></a><strong>See How Much Money Your Channel Has Made</strong></h4><p>Select a specific timeline and see how much your channel has made from ads and YouTube Red viewers during that duration.</p>
<p>There are 3 ways to change the timeline:</p>

<p>You can also change how you view your data, whether Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc. This way you can see exactly how much you made each day, week, or month, and determine if you can correlate a particular dip or spike to an event that occurred.</p>

Consider how these videos are successful:</p>
<p>- Was the content great?</p>
<p>- Was it the perfect length?</p>
<p>- Was it a well-structured video?</p>
<p>- Was the video’s pacing fast?</p>
<p> Once you’ve done a full evaluation, see if you can apply it to your other videos.</p>

Click into Geography and see how much you are making in different countries and consider which audience is best to focus your attention on with the intention of increasing revenue.</p>
<h4 id="Compare-Estimated-Revenue-Earning-to-Other-Metrics-1"><a href="#Compare-Estimated-Revenue-Earning-to-Other-Metrics-1" class="headerlink" title="Compare Estimated Revenue Earning to Other Metrics"></a><strong>Compare Estimated Revenue Earning to Other Metrics</strong></h4><p>Know more about how your data are related by comparing to see if Revenue is affected by the performance of metrics in other categories such as Views. Does a rise in view change your revenue?</p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ad Rates</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understanding the Ad Rates Report</strong></p>
<p><img

                >  </p>
<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>
<h4 id="See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-1"><a href="#See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-1" class="headerlink" title="See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue"></a><strong>See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue</strong></h4><p>Unlike the Revenue dashboard, the Ad Rates report dives deeper into the performance of individual monetized videos.</p>
<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

<p>You can see these details from the channel level or from an individual video level.</p>

You want to make videos, and not worry too much about ads, after all.</p>
<p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p>
<p><strong>5. Watch Time</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-The-Aggregated-Time-Your-Viewers-Spent-Watching-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#See-The-Aggregated-Time-Your-Viewers-Spent-Watching-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="See The Aggregated Time Your Viewers Spent Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See The Aggregated Time Your Viewers Spent Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>YouTube puts a lot of weight on this metric because they know that the more time people spend watching your original content, the more time they will have to show ads to your audience. Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>
<p><img

                >  </p>
<p>In the graph, you will also be able to see the combined Views of all your videos, as well as the segmented performance of YouTube Red viewers.</p>
<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-Watch-Time-Report-1"><a href="#How-to-Use-Watch-Time-Report-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Watch Time Report"></a><strong>How to Use Watch Time Report</strong></h4><p>If you want to be in YouTube’s algorithm’s good books, then you will need to put some attention on your channel’s Watch Time. Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img

                >  </p>
<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-1"><a href="#How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Use Audience Retention</strong></h4><p>Audience retention can give you a lot of insights on how you should be structuring your videos. If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>

<p>If you are creating content that targets international viewers, it’s good to know if they are engaging with your translation assets, including subtitles.</p>
<p>For example, if you see an increase in viewers from Brazil, do a quick translation of your transcript and upload the Portuguese subtitles and see if it increases viewers.</p>

<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>

<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

<p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p>
<p><strong>5. Watch Time</strong></p>

Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>
<p><img

<p>In the graph, you will also be able to see the combined Views of all your videos, as well as the segmented performance of YouTube Red viewers.</p>
<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img

                >  </p>
<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-2"><a href="#How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Use Audience Retention</strong></h4><p>Audience retention can give you a lot of insights on how you should be structuring your videos. If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>7. Demographics</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understand the Average Age and Gender of Your Audience</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you’ll see when you enter the Demographic dashboard is the segmentation of your audience by age and gender. This gives you a good indication of who your overall channel is currently attracting.</p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>

<p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p>

<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ad Rates</strong></p>

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>
<h4 id="See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-3"><a href="#See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-3" class="headerlink" title="See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue"></a><strong>See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue</strong></h4><p>Unlike the Revenue dashboard, the Ad Rates report dives deeper into the performance of individual monetized videos.</p>
<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

You want to make videos, and not worry too much about ads, after all.</p>
<p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p>
<p><strong>5. Watch Time</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-The-Aggregated-Time-Your-Viewers-Spent-Watching-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#See-The-Aggregated-Time-Your-Viewers-Spent-Watching-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="See The Aggregated Time Your Viewers Spent Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See The Aggregated Time Your Viewers Spent Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>YouTube puts a lot of weight on this metric because they know that the more time people spend watching your original content, the more time they will have to show ads to your audience. Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>
<p><img

<p>In the graph, you will also be able to see the combined Views of all your videos, as well as the segmented performance of YouTube Red viewers.</p>
<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="absolute-audience-retention"
                >  </p>
<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-3"><a href="#How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Use Audience Retention</strong></h4><p>Audience retention can give you a lot of insights on how you should be structuring your videos. If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>7. Demographics</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understand the Average Age and Gender of Your Audience</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you’ll see when you enter the Demographic dashboard is the segmentation of your audience by age and gender. This gives you a good indication of who your overall channel is currently attracting.</p>

Will you keep growing that audience or will you want to grow in another demographic?</p>
<p>If you noticed that you have an underperforming female demographic in India, you can plan out some content that focus on that community. Without this report, you cannot see where you are missing opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>8. Playback Locations</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Find Out Where People Are Watching Your Videos</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of ways people can watch your YouTube video:</p>
<p>- YouTube Watch Page</p>
<p>- YouTube Channel Page</p>
<p>- Embedded Video Player (Website or App)</p>
<p>- Other</p>
<p>If your video is only promoted organically your views will likely be coming from the YouTube Watch Page, but if other media publications embedded your video, and it’s getting a lot of views, you can see it here.</p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>
<p><strong>11. Translations</strong></p>
<p> <strong>See If You Need to Include Multi-Languages or Translation to Your Videos</strong></p>
<p>The Translations report is where you can see how your viewers are watching your videos in terms of using translations and subtitles.</p>
<p>If you are creating content that targets international viewers, it’s good to know if they are engaging with your translation assets, including subtitles.</p>
<p>For example, if you see an increase in viewers from Brazil, do a quick translation of your transcript and upload the Portuguese subtitles and see if it increases viewers.</p>

There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.</p>
<p>7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="Show-your-face"><a href="#Show-your-face" class="headerlink" title="Show your face"></a>Show your face</h4></li>
</ol>
<p>In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p>

<ol>
<li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li>
</ol>
<p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p>

</ol>
<p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p>

<p>When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, “Watch Later” and “Add to Queue,” located on its right size. Come on, you don’t want your beautiful thumbnail that cost you a few hours be covered. To avoid these icons from hiding your important stuff of thumbnail, make sure to put everything on the right side of your thumbnail.</p>

<p>Do you know that Youtube can show a 3-second preview of your video when someone hovers the cursor over it? It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don’t click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That’s why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.</p>

There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.</p>
<p>7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="Show-your-face-1"><a href="#Show-your-face-1" class="headerlink" title="Show your face"></a>Show your face</h4></li>
</ol>
<p>In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p>

<ol>
<li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts-1"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li>
</ol>
<p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p>

<p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p>

It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don’t click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That’s why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.</p>

There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.</p>
<p>7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.</p>

<li><h4 id="Show-your-face-2"><a href="#Show-your-face-2" class="headerlink" title="Show your face"></a>Show your face</h4></li>
</ol>
<p>In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p>

<li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts-2"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts-2" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li>
</ol>
<p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p>

<p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p>

<p>It is one of the old tricks that <strong>so many people on Youtube us</strong>e. <strong>It undoubtedly</strong> brings you clicks and more views, but once the viewer realizes that you have used irrelevant pictures or texts to attract them**. I**n reality, your video doesn’t contain any information related to it, you are going to lose their trust. They are never going to click on your videos again. Even if you don’t use such a trick anymore. Try to avoid such activities. Avoiding such activities can make your channel grow in the long term. Only use the text and images that are relevant to your content and stick to that.</p>

<p>Do you know that Youtube can show a 3-second preview of your video when someone hovers the cursor over it? It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don’t click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That’s why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.</p>

<ol>
<li><h4 id="Show-your-face-3"><a href="#Show-your-face-3" class="headerlink" title="Show your face"></a>Show your face</h4></li>
</ol>
<p>In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p>

<li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts-3"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts-3" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li>
</ol>
<p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p>

<p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p>

<p>It is one of the old tricks that <strong>so many people on Youtube us</strong>e. <strong>It undoubtedly</strong> brings you clicks and more views, but once the viewer realizes that you have used irrelevant pictures or texts to attract them**. I**n reality, your video doesn’t contain any information related to it, you are going to lose their trust. They are never going to click on your videos again. Even if you don’t use such a trick anymore. Try to avoid such activities. Avoiding such activities can make your channel grow in the long term.

<p>Do you know that Youtube can show a 3-second preview of your video when someone hovers the cursor over it? It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don’t click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That’s why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly. If the preview is not selected for two days, it means your video is not eligible for it.</p>
