Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:

Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:

In 2021, we saw the stock market rise to unexpected gains, despite all the issues that the year brought. Against all odds, the average investor made a profit, and some of the most important stocks raised to new highs, and 2022 might bring even more profits for those who are patient and make their due diligence.

There is a lot of information online and in books about the stock market and how to make intelligent investments, but Youtube channels seem to be where most investors get their information from. This might be due to how easily information is passed to the listener.

In this article, we will talk about the best Youtube channels for the stock market. We will list the top fourteen channels that will definitely help you make the most out of your investment, whether you are looking for short or long-term investments.

#### In this article

01 [14 Best Stock Youtube Channels](#part1)

02 [FAQs about Stock Youtube Channels](#part2)

## Part 1: 14 Best Stock Youtube Channels

### 1.Sasha Evdakov: [Tradersfly](https://www.youtube.com/c/tradersflyofficial)

This is one of the best Youtube channels for stock market beginners. Sasha Evdakov is a great teacher and can introduce the hardest topics to everyone, regarding their level of knowledge in the stock market.

By going through his first videos, you'll get a general idea of the basics of how to approach the stock market in 2022\. He advocates more long-term investments and because he's located in the United States, most of the information about stocks is about U.S. stocks. This is not necessarily a bad thing as many of the largest companies in the world trade in the U.S. stock market. He's very reciprocal and willing to share new ideas with his members. Definitely a good start if you want to dig more into stocks. He started his channel back in 2021 and releases videos once a week.

### 2.[Investors Underground](https://www.youtube.com/user/investorsunderground)

Investors Underground is a 145K subscriber stock market channel based in the U.S. A great plus of this channel is its live chat and great instructional videos. It was created by two investors back in May of 2013\. Besides having a strong following, in this channel, you can also connect with other traders and exchange information and tips on what stocks might be good to hold for the long term or others that might be better to sell. In this channel, you can also have daily recaps so you can be on top of all the major movements during the day and not miss anything. Investors Underground has many lessons from beginners to more advanced traders so it is recommended for all types of investors. You can also follow them on other social media platforms like Twitter and Instagram to have constant updates throughout your day.

### 3.[Young And Investing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCczMw5XzxxVks7sNaC-QxwQ)

This channel releases two videos every quarter, which means these are usually longer and encompass more information than the channels that release videos every week. But in general, these have more accurate information because the creators have more time to analyze all the data. Young And Investing are based in Belgium, so the channel is more focused on European stocks. Besides the normal stocks, this channel also offers cryptocurrency reviews, tutorials, and portfolios. With more than 7 million views since the creation of the channel in April 2017, Young And Investing have one of the biggest following in this area. If you have any doubt you can contact directly the creator, Quinten through his personal email.

### 4.[High Altitude Investing](https://www.youtube.com/c/HighAltitudeInvesting)

With almost 2 million views and 27 thousand subscribers, High Altitude Investing is one of the best bitcoin and altcoin channels on youtube when it comes to investing. This is not a conventional stock market channel and it aims to more advanced traders and investors. Joining Youtube in February 2016, High Altitude Investing is certainly a great choice if you want to get more involved in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It also has a dedicated website, Instagram, Twitter, and a Discord channel where you can follow more closely.

### 5.[Stock Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/c/StockTricks)

Stock Tricks is one of the best Youtube channels for the stock market in the UK. The content ranges from beginner's videos to any kind of cryptocurrency. This is a great channel to follow to have a great grip on the global stock market, especially because the channel releases about four videos every month.
