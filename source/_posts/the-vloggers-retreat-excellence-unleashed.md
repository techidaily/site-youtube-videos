YouTube Creator Summit has been held for several years. In 2019, it was held in Tokyo, Japan, but back in 2016, 2017 and 2018, it was held in New York City. This article just introduced the YouTube Creator Summit in 2017.

Tons of big-name creators were flown out by YouTube for a week of activities, networking opportunities, interesting speakers, and unicorn petting zoos. We assume.

* [**Branded slippers**](#slippers)
* [**Pins, pins, pins**](#pins)
* [**Denim jacket**](#jacket)

_Lilly’s Creator Summit adventures._

The Creator Summit is invite-only, and only 120 YouTubers attended including Grace Helbig, Lilly Singh, Matthew Santoro, Eva Gutowski, Jon Cozart, and Hannah Hart. We can really only imagine what went on based on what some YouTubers chose to share with us over social media. That’s how we know there were appearances from off-YouTube celebrities too, like Will Smith and Riz Ahmed.

_Will Smith was one of the speakers at the summit. Turns out_ [_he’s a big fan of Lilly Singh_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGlcsogbAQY)_._

Thanks to Nick from nickatnyte, for example, we have a pretty clear picture of the kinds of swag YouTube was giving away.

_Nick talks about arriving in New York and goes through the swag box waiting in his hotel room._

There were some clues as to what the rest of the summit was like hiding amongst the swag too. Here’s what was in the box:

## 1\. A map of Dumbo

The hotel YouTube put the creators up in was in Dumbo, Brooklyn. ‘Dumbo’ is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. While it used to be primarily an industrial area, Dumbo is now the most expensive neighborhood in Brooklyn with many of the old industrial spaces now serving as luxury residential lofts. Dumbo is also a hub for tech startups.

_Tess takes you to some of her favorite places in Dumbo._

Dumbo is home to an interesting mix of ‘past’ and ‘future’. The creators who attended the summit probably had a lot of fun exploring it.

## 2\. Post Cards

One of the major benefits of attending this summit would have been networking with other creators, but because of how busy everyone was and how awkward it can be to arrange ‘bumping into’ someone YouTube created a way for creators to send each other notes. All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.

## 3\. S’well bottle

S’well bottles are stainless steel beverage containers that keep drinks hot or cold. They retail for around $45\. YouTubers invited to the Creator Summit received ones with YouTube branding on them. A good water bottle is a convention/conference essential, so this was a very practical gift.

## 4\. Branded slippers

To help them relax after long days at the summit, YouTube provided creators with YouTube-branded slippers. They look pretty comfy. Plus, now every time these YouTubers look down at their feet they’ll be reminded to go make some videos.

![Branded slippers - 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-branded-slippers.jpg)

_thinknoodles wearing his YouTube slippers._

## 5\. Pins, pins, pins

There were numerous custom pins available at different events at the summit. Aside from a complementary Brooklyn and 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (the hotel the creators were staying at) pins, the creators did not receive these in their swag boxes – they had to collect them.

## 6\. Denim jacket

A denim jacket with a play button on it was also in the box. The idea was that creators would collect pins and display them on their new jackets. At the end of the week, they would have a great souvenir reminding them of every event they attended at the summit.

_![Denim jacket- 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-denim-jacket.jpg)_

_Hannah Hart posted this photo from a river cruise she and other YouTubers went on while in New York for the summit._

Most creators here on Filmora are still trying to grow their channels, but one day I hope you’ll be able to attend an event like the YouTube Creator Summit and tell us all about it!

YouTube is a social platform that relies on visually exciting material to attract the audience. Just like a book with an appealing cover compels a person to pick it up and read, it is significant to display and advertise your YouTube channel in a way that makes viewers click and browse through the channel.

Despite creating a beautiful banner on your desktop screen, it might end up distorted on a mobile screen if the recommended sizes for all kinds of gadgets are not followed. Hence, choosing your YouTube channel art dimension is essential since it is the viewer's first impression. To commence with, you must be careful about your **YouTube banner size** and **channel art dimensions**. Are you wondering how to create the perfect banner or cover photo as we know it? Worry not as we are going to tell you the exact details to achieve an ideal YouTube banner size that fits all devices from computers to phones.

* [**Part 1: The Recommended YouTube Banner Size**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: The Best YouTube Banner Size on Different Devices**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: The Best YouTube Video Maker--Wondershare Filmora**](#part3)

## Part 1: The Recommended YouTube Banner Size

According to YouTube's official standards, the recommended banner size is 2560×1440 pixels. However, the minimum image dimensions are 2048×1152 pixels. To ensure that your text is visible regardless of the screen size, sticking to the "safe area" of 2560×423 pixels is the best option. Why are these sizes significant? Well, it's essential to keep in mind the fact that people worldwide will be using different kinds of gadgets to access YouTube, and it is crucial to optimize your YouTube banner size for it to be ideal.

## Part 2: The Best YouTube Banner Size on Different Devices

For the best results on all devices, your YouTube banner size should be:

1. [TV](#TV)
2. [Desktop Minimum and Mobile](#Mobile)

 ![desktop minimum dimension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/desktop-minimum-mobile3.jpg)

On small desktop monitors and mobile devices, YouTube will display less than 20% of your entire channel art, the center area measuring a width of 1546 pixels and a height of 423 pixels. You want to make sure that your text and logo make it into this part.

 ![channel art on mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/channel-art-on-mobile4.jpg)

Here’s what our YouTube channel art example would look like on a mobile phone.

#### **YouTube Channel Art/Banner Dimensions Displayed on Larger Desktop Monitors**

 2560 x 423 px

 ![desktop max dimension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/desktop-max-dimension7.jpg)

On larger desktop monitors, YouTube will display the entire width of your channel art but not the upper and lower part.
