Creators don’t have to ask the community to support them financially. They only create good quality content and build a large following. The new YouTube policies for monetization will mostly benefit creators who create Shorts or stream on YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/latest-youtube-monetization-policy-and-requirements-4.JPG"                      alt="shorts revenue sample"                ></p><p>Streamers usually have a higher watch time than the number of subscribers they have.

More creators find the new policies more friendly and are more willing to put their content on the platform.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Advertisers-to-Benefit"><a href="#Advertisers-to-Benefit" class="headerlink" title="Advertisers to Benefit"></a><strong>Advertisers to Benefit</strong></h3><p>The new YouTube channel monetization rules will be great for advertisers. They will no longer have to worry about their ads showing up on videos that are inappropriate or fly-by-night. The quality of channels where the ads show will be much better. This means that advertiser will have their ads placed on channels of nano- and micro-influencers. These are more likely to have a loyal following and are more likely to act on the adverts.</p><h3 id="Creators-Ability-to-Monetize-their-Channels"><a href="#Creators-Ability-to-Monetize-their-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels"></a><strong>Creators Ability to Monetize their Channels</strong></h3><p>The new policies make it easier for more creators to monetize their channels. Since this is the goal of every creator, it will be an opportunity for more people to start committing to their YouTube career. With the new ways of making money being introduced, more YouTubers will be able to generate revenues from their channels.</p><p>It’s interesting that watch hours from shorts will not count along the standard 4,000 public watch hours. This is a plus for many creators. You will find that many creators who post shorts on their channels have more views than their long views. With the new policies, it means that they can monetize their channels based only on the short’s figures.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Editing-YouTube-Videos-For-Monetization-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-Editing-YouTube-Videos-For-Monetization-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Master Copy"></a>1. Master Copy</h4><p> Before exporting your work, it is important to first create a master copy of your project that is ‘as is’, in that it reflects the settings and codecs used in the original footage.</p><p> To do this you simply select the sequence within the Timeline or in the Project Panel, and go through the menu tree via <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Media</strong> to bring up the export dialogue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/exportdialogue.png"                      alt="exportdialogue"                ></p><p> To create your Master Copy, simply select the first option of ‘Match Sequence Settings’, this exports a file that is of the same quality as your original footage, essentially producing a digital copy of the work for archiving before anything else is done.</p><p> With you work safe and secure it is now time to look at ensuring the project is suitable for YouTube. With our sequence selected in the Timeline or Project Panel again, we go through the same <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Media</strong> path to bring up the media export dialogue as before.</p><h4 id="2-Container"><a href="#2-Container" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p> The first option we have to consider is the file format that our finished video needs to be in. Here you should refer to YouTube for its guidelines, whilst they do accept a number of file formats, digging through the YouTube help system to find the settings for highest quality we find that they recommend MPEG4 as the container, using the  codec.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/youtube-recommended-settings.png"                      alt="youtube-recommended-settings"                ></p><p> We can also see further recommended settings in this screenshot that will be covered later.</p><p> The good news is that Premiere automatically selects the appropriate container for us when we select our codec, however it is worth knowing the file type YouTube is expecting just to check yourself.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Codec"><a href="#3-Video-Codec" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Codec"></a>3. Video Codec</h4><p> So having established that YouTube recommends the MPEG4 container using the  codec, the first option we need to look for in the media export dialogue is to select the appropriate Format.</p><p> This is the first drop down in the dialogue box, and in this case we simply select  from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/choosing-format.png"                      alt="choosing-format"                ></p><p> Once you select  you can check the ‘output name’ field and see that premiere is automatically set the output file to .mp4 which is exactly what we need.</p><h4 id="4-Preset"><a href="#4-Preset" class="headerlink" title="4. Preset"></a>4. Preset</h4><p> The next field we come to is the ‘Preset’ dropdown menu. This is a major help to most people, as Adobe have very kindly included large numbers of presets to quickly adapt video settings to suit specific uses. They vary depending on the exact version of Premiere you are using, and each format type does have its own list of presets,  as we can see has a large number for YouTube, but also has many presets for specific devices (presets for iPad, Kindle, Nook, various other tablets and phones, Vimeo and a host of others) to make getting the right settings that bit easier for us.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2069351&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-24_%282%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/presets.png"                      alt="presets"                ></p><p> It is important here to select the correct preset from the various YouTube options. You want to select the resolution and frame rate that match your source file, for the best results. So, if your source file is 1080p with a frame rate of 29.97 fps then that is the YouTube setting you would select.</p><p> Once a preset is selected a summary of the settings is displayed below, normally these will be well suited to your project, however you can fine tune anything you wish by selecting the video or audio tabs at the bottom which give you the chance to adjust each parameter individually. If you do this, you can save these changes as a custom preset by clicking the button at the side of the Preset dropdown menu and simply use it on later projects by selecting it from the list the same as any other, a great time saving tool.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/finetuning.png"                      alt="finetuning"                ></p><h4 id="5-Rendering"><a href="#5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="5. Rendering"></a>5. Rendering</h4><p> Once you are satisfied with the settings, either from the Preset alone or if you have adjusted anything yourself, you are nearly ready to render the file and export it.</p><p> For YouTube it is recommended you select the ‘Use Maximum Render Quality’ option to maintain the best output you can, it does add time to the render process but if you value the quality of your work it is worthwhile.</p><p> Finally you can choose a suitable filename and the destination of the file by clicking on the ‘Output Name’ field.</p><p> I normally use a filename that includes the destination medium so I can differentiate between different versions of a project and know which one to upload where, in this case I include ‘youtube’, but if I were planning on uploading clips of the project to vimeo as well for instance there may be a cut of the project with ‘vimeo’ in the name too. The destination is personal preference, because I do use filenames to differentiate versions I can put the various iterations into a single project file, others have folder structures for each type of file , so all YouTube output goes into a single folder and so on, how you organize is entirely dependent on how you work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/filename.png"                      alt="filename"                ></p><p> Once those are selected clicking ‘Export’ starts the rendering process, and eventually (how long depends on the speed of your computer and the size and type of file involved), you will end up with your YouTube optimized video in the location you chose.</p><p> Here I created 4 key frames that let the ‘Animation’ object move around the ‘Demo Text’ Object and finally come to rest below it. Whilst this type of effect does look very effective on screen, such is the ease of use of After Effects it really is just a few minutes work to achieve.</p><p> Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text in Premiere &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-Uploading"><a href="#6-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="6.

Master Copy"></a>1. Master Copy</h4><p> Before exporting your work, it is important to first create a master copy of your project that is ‘as is’, in that it reflects the settings and codecs used in the original footage.</p><p> To do this you simply select the sequence within the Timeline or in the Project Panel, and go through the menu tree via <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Media</strong> to bring up the export dialogue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/exportdialogue.png"                      alt="exportdialogue"                ></p><p> To create your Master Copy, simply select the first option of ‘Match Sequence Settings’, this exports a file that is of the same quality as your original footage, essentially producing a digital copy of the work for archiving before anything else is done.</p><p> With you work safe and secure it is now time to look at ensuring the project is suitable for YouTube. With our sequence selected in the Timeline or Project Panel again, we go through the same <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Media</strong> path to bring up the media export dialogue as before.</p><h4 id="2-Container-1"><a href="#2-Container-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p> The first option we have to consider is the file format that our finished video needs to be in. Here you should refer to YouTube for its guidelines, whilst they do accept a number of file formats, digging through the YouTube help system to find the settings for highest quality we find that they recommend MPEG4 as the container, using the  codec.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/youtube-recommended-settings.png"                      alt="youtube-recommended-settings"                ></p><p> We can also see further recommended settings in this screenshot that will be covered later.</p><p> The good news is that Premiere automatically selects the appropriate container for us when we select our codec, however it is worth knowing the file type YouTube is expecting just to check yourself.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Codec-1"><a href="#3-Video-Codec-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Codec"></a>3. Video Codec</h4><p> So having established that YouTube recommends the MPEG4 container using the  codec, the first option we need to look for in the media export dialogue is to select the appropriate Format.</p><p> This is the first drop down in the dialogue box, and in this case we simply select  from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/choosing-format.png"                      alt="choosing-format"                ></p><p> Once you select  you can check the ‘output name’ field and see that premiere is automatically set the output file to .mp4 which is exactly what we need.</p><h4 id="4-Preset-1"><a href="#4-Preset-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Preset"></a>4. Preset</h4><p> The next field we come to is the ‘Preset’ dropdown menu. This is a major help to most people, as Adobe have very kindly included large numbers of presets to quickly adapt video settings to suit specific uses. They vary depending on the exact version of Premiere you are using, and each format type does have its own list of presets,  as we can see has a large number for YouTube, but also has many presets for specific devices (presets for iPad, Kindle, Nook, various other tablets and phones, Vimeo and a host of others) to make getting the right settings that bit easier for us.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/presets.png"                      alt="presets"                ></p><p> It is important here to select the correct preset from the various YouTube options. You want to select the resolution and frame rate that match your source file, for the best results. So, if your source file is 1080p with a frame rate of 29.97 fps then that is the YouTube setting you would select.</p><p> Once a preset is selected a summary of the settings is displayed below, normally these will be well suited to your project, however you can fine tune anything you wish by selecting the video or audio tabs at the bottom which give you the chance to adjust each parameter individually. If you do this, you can save these changes as a custom preset by clicking the button at the side of the Preset dropdown menu and simply use it on later projects by selecting it from the list the same as any other, a great time saving tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/finetuning.png"                      alt="finetuning"                ></p><h4 id="5-Rendering-1"><a href="#5-Rendering-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Rendering"></a>5. Rendering</h4><p> Once you are satisfied with the settings, either from the Preset alone or if you have adjusted anything yourself, you are nearly ready to render the file and export it.</p><p> For YouTube it is recommended you select the ‘Use Maximum Render Quality’ option to maintain the best output you can, it does add time to the render process but if you value the quality of your work it is worthwhile.</p><p> Finally you can choose a suitable filename and the destination of the file by clicking on the ‘Output Name’ field.</p><p> I normally use a filename that includes the destination medium so I can differentiate between different versions of a project and know which one to upload where, in this case I include ‘youtube’, but if I were planning on uploading clips of the project to vimeo as well for instance there may be a cut of the project with ‘vimeo’ in the name too. The destination is personal preference, because I do use filenames to differentiate versions I can put the various iterations into a single project file, others have folder structures for each type of file , so all YouTube output goes into a single folder and so on, how you organize is entirely dependent on how you work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/filename.png"                      alt="filename"                ></p><p> Once those are selected clicking ‘Export’ starts the rendering process, and eventually (how long depends on the speed of your computer and the size and type of file involved), you will end up with your YouTube optimized video in the location you chose.</p><p> Here I created 4 key frames that let the ‘Animation’ object move around the ‘Demo Text’ Object and finally come to rest below it. Whilst this type of effect does look very effective on screen, such is the ease of use of After Effects it really is just a few minutes work to achieve.</p><p> Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text in Premiere &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-Uploading-1"><a href="#6-Uploading-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Uploading"></a>6. Uploading</h4><p> Now you have your file, the next step is to go to your YouTube account and log in if you need to.</p><p> On the top of your homepage on the right is the upload button, selecting that brings up the select file menu as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/upload-menu.png"                      alt="upload-menu"                ></p><p> You can either drag your file into the window or click on it to open a standard file browser to locate the desired file, click and the upload will begin.

With our sequence selected in the Timeline or Project Panel again, we go through the same <strong>File &gt; Export &gt; Media</strong> path to bring up the media export dialogue as before.</p><h4 id="2-Container-2"><a href="#2-Container-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Container"></a>2. Container</h4><p> The first option we have to consider is the file format that our finished video needs to be in. Here you should refer to YouTube for its guidelines, whilst they do accept a number of file formats, digging through the YouTube help system to find the settings for highest quality we find that they recommend MPEG4 as the container, using the  codec.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/youtube-recommended-settings.png"                      alt="youtube-recommended-settings"                ></p><p> We can also see further recommended settings in this screenshot that will be covered later.</p><p> The good news is that Premiere automatically selects the appropriate container for us when we select our codec, however it is worth knowing the file type YouTube is expecting just to check yourself.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Codec-2"><a href="#3-Video-Codec-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Codec"></a>3. Video Codec</h4><p> So having established that YouTube recommends the MPEG4 container using the  codec, the first option we need to look for in the media export dialogue is to select the appropriate Format.</p><p> This is the first drop down in the dialogue box, and in this case we simply select  from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/choosing-format.png"                      alt="choosing-format"                ></p><p> Once you select  you can check the ‘output name’ field and see that premiere is automatically set the output file to .mp4 which is exactly what we need.</p><h4 id="4-Preset-2"><a href="#4-Preset-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Preset"></a>4. Preset</h4><p> The next field we come to is the ‘Preset’ dropdown menu. This is a major help to most people, as Adobe have very kindly included large numbers of presets to quickly adapt video settings to suit specific uses. They vary depending on the exact version of Premiere you are using, and each format type does have its own list of presets,  as we can see has a large number for YouTube, but also has many presets for specific devices (presets for iPad, Kindle, Nook, various other tablets and phones, Vimeo and a host of others) to make getting the right settings that bit easier for us.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/presets.png"                      alt="presets"                ></p><p> It is important here to select the correct preset from the various YouTube options. You want to select the resolution and frame rate that match your source file, for the best results. So, if your source file is 1080p with a frame rate of 29.97 fps then that is the YouTube setting you would select.</p><p> Once a preset is selected a summary of the settings is displayed below, normally these will be well suited to your project, however you can fine tune anything you wish by selecting the video or audio tabs at the bottom which give you the chance to adjust each parameter individually. If you do this, you can save these changes as a custom preset by clicking the button at the side of the Preset dropdown menu and simply use it on later projects by selecting it from the list the same as any other, a great time saving tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/finetuning.png"                      alt="finetuning"                ></p><h4 id="5-Rendering-2"><a href="#5-Rendering-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Rendering"></a>5. Rendering</h4><p> Once you are satisfied with the settings, either from the Preset alone or if you have adjusted anything yourself, you are nearly ready to render the file and export it.</p><p> For YouTube it is recommended you select the ‘Use Maximum Render Quality’ option to maintain the best output you can, it does add time to the render process but if you value the quality of your work it is worthwhile.</p><p> Finally you can choose a suitable filename and the destination of the file by clicking on the ‘Output Name’ field.</p><p> I normally use a filename that includes the destination medium so I can differentiate between different versions of a project and know which one to upload where, in this case I include ‘youtube’, but if I were planning on uploading clips of the project to vimeo as well for instance there may be a cut of the project with ‘vimeo’ in the name too. The destination is personal preference, because I do use filenames to differentiate versions I can put the various iterations into a single project file, others have folder structures for each type of file , so all YouTube output goes into a single folder and so on, how you organize is entirely dependent on how you work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/filename.png"                      alt="filename"                ></p><p> Once those are selected clicking ‘Export’ starts the rendering process, and eventually (how long depends on the speed of your computer and the size and type of file involved), you will end up with your YouTube optimized video in the location you chose.</p><p> Here I created 4 key frames that let the ‘Animation’ object move around the ‘Demo Text’ Object and finally come to rest below it.

Video Codec</h4><p> So having established that YouTube recommends the MPEG4 container using the  codec, the first option we need to look for in the media export dialogue is to select the appropriate Format.</p><p> This is the first drop down in the dialogue box, and in this case we simply select  from the list.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/choosing-format.png"                      alt="choosing-format"                ></p><p> Once you select  you can check the ‘output name’ field and see that premiere is automatically set the output file to .mp4 which is exactly what we need.</p><h4 id="4-Preset-3"><a href="#4-Preset-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Preset"></a>4. Preset</h4><p> The next field we come to is the ‘Preset’ dropdown menu. This is a major help to most people, as Adobe have very kindly included large numbers of presets to quickly adapt video settings to suit specific uses. They vary depending on the exact version of Premiere you are using, and each format type does have its own list of presets,  as we can see has a large number for YouTube, but also has many presets for specific devices (presets for iPad, Kindle, Nook, various other tablets and phones, Vimeo and a host of others) to make getting the right settings that bit easier for us.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/presets.png"                      alt="presets"                ></p><p> It is important here to select the correct preset from the various YouTube options. You want to select the resolution and frame rate that match your source file, for the best results. So, if your source file is 1080p with a frame rate of 29.97 fps then that is the YouTube setting you would select.</p><p> Once a preset is selected a summary of the settings is displayed below, normally these will be well suited to your project, however you can fine tune anything you wish by selecting the video or audio tabs at the bottom which give you the chance to adjust each parameter individually. If you do this, you can save these changes as a custom preset by clicking the button at the side of the Preset dropdown menu and simply use it on later projects by selecting it from the list the same as any other, a great time saving tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/finetuning.png"                      alt="finetuning"                ></p><h4 id="5-Rendering-3"><a href="#5-Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Rendering"></a>5. Rendering</h4><p> Once you are satisfied with the settings, either from the Preset alone or if you have adjusted anything yourself, you are nearly ready to render the file and export it.</p><p> For YouTube it is recommended you select the ‘Use Maximum Render Quality’ option to maintain the best output you can, it does add time to the render process but if you value the quality of your work it is worthwhile.</p><p> Finally you can choose a suitable filename and the destination of the file by clicking on the ‘Output Name’ field.</p><p> I normally use a filename that includes the destination medium so I can differentiate between different versions of a project and know which one to upload where, in this case I include ‘youtube’, but if I were planning on uploading clips of the project to vimeo as well for instance there may be a cut of the project with ‘vimeo’ in the name too. The destination is personal preference, because I do use filenames to differentiate versions I can put the various iterations into a single project file, others have folder structures for each type of file , so all YouTube output goes into a single folder and so on, how you organize is entirely dependent on how you work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/filename.png"                      alt="filename"                ></p><p> Once those are selected clicking ‘Export’ starts the rendering process, and eventually (how long depends on the speed of your computer and the size and type of file involved), you will end up with your YouTube optimized video in the location you chose.</p><p> Here I created 4 key frames that let the ‘Animation’ object move around the ‘Demo Text’ Object and finally come to rest below it. Whilst this type of effect does look very effective on screen, such is the ease of use of After Effects it really is just a few minutes work to achieve.</p><p> Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text in Premiere &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-Uploading-3"><a href="#6-Uploading-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Uploading"></a>6. Uploading</h4><p> Now you have your file, the next step is to go to your YouTube account and log in if you need to.</p><p> On the top of your homepage on the right is the upload button, selecting that brings up the select file menu as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/upload-menu.png"                      alt="upload-menu"                ></p><p> You can either drag your file into the window or click on it to open a standard file browser to locate the desired file, click and the upload will begin. The dropdown underneath allows you to set the video as Public, Unlisted or Private. You can change this at any time once the video is uploaded as well.</p><p> This opens the upload progress window, where you can add in a name, description and tags as well as add the video to a playlist or adjust the privacy settings as the video is uploading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/upload-progress.png"                      alt="upload-progress"                ></p><p> Once the upload as finished, you can do final adjustments to settings and choose a thumbnail for the video. The final step is to click the ‘Publish’ button and your video will be processed and go live.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453721/17020" target="_top" id="1453721"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453721"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453721/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-vidverse-app-critique-digest/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  VidVerse App Critique Digest</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-ace-your-online-presence-youtubes-studio-command-center/"><u>[New] Ace Your Online Presence  YouTube's Studio Command Center</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-audio-archiving-strategies-on-apple-devices/"><u>[New] Audio Archiving Strategies on Apple Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-charting-financial-success-the-tale-of-ajey-carryminati-and-youtube/"><u>[New] Charting Financial Success  The Tale of Ajey (CarryMinati) and YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-charting-your-path-to-higher-youtube-spotlight/"><u>[New] Charting Your Path to Higher YouTube Spotlight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-cone-chronicles-a-deep-dive-into-ice-cream-recording-software-for-2024/"><u>[New] Cone Chronicles  A Deep Dive Into Ice Cream Recording Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/utstanding-films-not-on-mainstream-lists/"><u>[New] Outstanding Films Not on Mainstream Lists</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-comprehensive-instructions-for-disposing-of-video-downloads/"><u>[Updated] Comprehensive Instructions for Disposing of Video Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-diving-into-the-world-of-youtube-search-engine-rankings/"><u>[Updated] Diving Into the World of YouTube Search Engine Rankings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-advanced-mac-photo-tips-5-efficient-snapshot-techniques/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Advanced Mac Photo Tips  5 Efficient Snapshot Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-make-the-most-of-your-gaming-experience-top-methods-to-document-minecraft-on-mac/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Make the Most of Your Gaming Experience -

It gives your viewers a sneak peek of what they can expect from your video and helps it stand out in the crowded world of YouTube.</p><p>When creating your thumbnail, it’s important to remember that the recommended size is 1280 x 720 pixels and a minimum width of 640 pixels. With these dimensions in mind, let’s dive into how you can easily create stunning thumbnails for your YouTube videos using your mobile phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-make-thumbnail-for-youtube-in-mobile.jpg"                      alt="make thumbnails or youtube with mobile phones"                ></p><h2 id="Method-1-Make-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-on-iPhone-With-the-iPhone-Photos-App"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-YouTube-Thumbnail-on-iPhone-With-the-iPhone-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Make a YouTube Thumbnail on iPhone With the iPhone Photos App"></a>Method 1. Make a YouTube Thumbnail on iPhone With the iPhone Photos App</h2><p>One way to create a thumbnail for your YouTube video on your iPhone is to use the built-in Photos app. The Photos app comes pre-installed on all iPhones and offers a range of editing tools you can use to create a thumbnail.</p><p>The Photos app on your iPhone offers a range of features that you can use to create a custom thumbnail for your YouTube video. Here are some of the features you can use:</p><ul><li><strong>Crop:</strong> The crop tool allows you to resize and reposition your thumbnail image by trimming away any unnecessary parts of the image.</li><li><strong>Rotate:</strong> The rotate tool lets you adjust the orientation of your thumbnail image.

Greet that one person as one person, as a ‘you’, instead of as a member of a group (i.e., avoid saying ‘you guys’).</p><p>The more you can make your trailer about the person watching it, the better. You are telling them about yourself, but you are doing it for their benefit. Address them directly (i.e. ‘If you like…’ or ‘you don’t want to miss’.) and make everything you say about them. For example, instead of saying ‘I post tutorials about’, try ‘you can learn about’.</p><h4 id="Flaunt-Your-Personality-–-It’s-All-About-You"><a href="#Flaunt-Your-Personality-–-It’s-All-About-You" class="headerlink" title="Flaunt Your Personality – It’s All About You"></a>Flaunt Your Personality – It’s All About You</h4><p>One of the golden rules of YouTube is ‘be yourself’. People will subscribe because they enjoy your personality and want to see more of it.</p><p>Use your trailer as an opportunity to showcase your unique perspective. Be yourself, and be the person that is excited to be making great YouTube videos. You are at your best when you let people see how much you care about something, so show your viewers how much you care about delivering great video content. This is what will make people want to subscribe.</p><h4 id="Talk-about-All-the-Cool-Stuff-You-Do"><a href="#Talk-about-All-the-Cool-Stuff-You-Do" class="headerlink" title="Talk about All the Cool Stuff You Do"></a>Talk about All the Cool Stuff You Do</h4><p>The best channel trailers give viewers a window into your channel. You need to show people what to expect from you as a personality, but you also need to tell them what to expect in terms of your videos.</p><p>Your channel trailer should include information like: what kinds of videos you make, why you make them, and what your upload schedule is.</p><p>Be specific. Instead of saying you make videos about makeup, say you make look tutorials and talk about your favorite styles. Instead of saying you are a gamer, tell your potential subscribers what games you post about and what some of your favorites are.</p><p>A specific schedule is important for getting people to subscribe. Generally, viewers do not subscribe to channels that have not posted in a long time.

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456"                      border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1.

In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3.

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta-1"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta-1" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006123/18460" target="_top" id="2006123"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006123"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006123/18460"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features-1"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips-1"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic.

Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features-3"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips-3"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis-3"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel-3"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources-3"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy.

However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.</p><p>Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-7"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-7" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>Smartphone cameras, especially the newest models, are capable of recording great videos.

There are even voice processing audio filters, so you can capture better audio while you’re shooting and have less to fix in post.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Final-Words-3"><a href="#Final-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>Because mobile cameras already perform so well, it can be easy to think to have more to adjust would only make things more complicated. However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.</p><p>Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

Plus, it is an easy way to disguise the room you are vlogging from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-blur01.JPG"                      alt="how to blur01"                ></p><p>Even if your set is clean, there could be things like books behind you, which will distract viewers; they will be trying to read the spines. Blurring out the background of your shot makes your video look polished and keeps people’s focus entirely on you.</p><ul><li><a href="#blur_background_in_video_shooting">Part 1: Blur YouTube Video Background in Shooting Videos</a></li><li><a href="#blur_background_in_video_editing">Part 2: Add Tilt-Shift Effects to Video in Editing</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-of-Your-YouTube-Video-in-Shooting-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Blur-Background-of-Your-YouTube-Video-in-Shooting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos"></a>Part 1: How to Blur Background of Your YouTube Video in Shooting Videos</h2><p>Blurring your background is also how you create a beautiful bokeh lighting effect. Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh" class="headerlink" title="1. Blurring and Bokeh"></a>1. Blurring and Bokeh</h4><p>Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.<br>To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Blur-your-Background"><a href="#2-How-to-Blur-your-Background" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Blur your Background"></a>2. How to Blur your Background</h4><p>Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.</p><p>If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.</p><p>To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f&#x2F;3 or f&#x2F;4 can also work.</p><p>Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject&#x2F;depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296985&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/9cea886b9f44a3c2df1163730ab64994/products/copy_nero_burning_rom_cart.png"                      border="0"                ><br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Blur Video Background in Post-Production with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production. Here, I will show you how to do that in Filmora.</p><p>Filmora is one of the most widely used video editing software among YouTubers. Its user-friendly interface and tutorial guide enables green-hands to start video editing quickly.

Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh-1"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Blurring and Bokeh"></a>1. Blurring and Bokeh</h4><p>Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.<br>To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Blur-your-Background-1"><a href="#2-How-to-Blur-your-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Blur your Background"></a>2. How to Blur your Background</h4><p>Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.</p><p>If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.</p><p>To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop. Ideally, your f-stop will be 2.8 or lower, but if your camera cannot go that low, then f&#x2F;3 or f&#x2F;4 can also work.</p><p>Creating a bokeh effect is mostly the same, except that it works best when your subject&#x2F;depth of field is very close to the camera, and you have a light source off in the background. Zoom Lenses do not usually have wide enough apertures to create bokeh backgrounds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#Blur-Video-Background-in-Post-Production-with-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="Blur Video Background in Post-Production with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Blur Video Background in Post-Production with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>If you need to blur the video background after shooting, you can use some video editing software to add the bokeh effect or the tilt-off effect in post-production.

Bokeh is when you blur lights in the background of your shot, creating halo-like circles of light. By attaching a filter with a shape cut out to the camera lens, you can even generate bokeh lights in other shapes, like hearts or stars.</p><p> <strong>Aperture</strong> refers to the hole in your lens which allows light into your camera. A narrow aperture lets in less light, and a wide aperture lets in more. The wider your aperture is, the shallower your depth of field will be. Widening your aperture also helps your camera perform better in low-light situations. Widening your aperture too much under the wrong circumstances can let in too much light and result in your footage being overexposed.</p><p> <strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the area of your image that is in focus. If you have a large depth of field, then objects close to and far away from your camera will all be in focus. Only a select area will be focused and the rest will be blurred if you have a shallow depth of field.</p><p> <strong>F-Stops</strong> are the measurement of an aperture’s width. The higher your f-stop, the narrower your aperture will be. To create a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need a wide aperture, and thus a small f-stop. F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.4’. You need an f-stop of less than f&#x2F;4 to blur your background, and less than f&#x2F;2.8 for bokeh.</p><h4 id="1-Blurring-and-Bokeh-3"><a href="#1-Blurring-and-Bokeh-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Blurring and Bokeh"></a>1. Blurring and Bokeh</h4><p>Blurred backgrounds and bokeh are very closely related. A bokeh effect is essentially a blurred background that includes lights.<br>To achieve a blurred background or a bokeh effect, you need to have a shallow depth of field. That means a wide aperture and a low f-stop.</p><h4 id="2-How-to-Blur-your-Background-3"><a href="#2-How-to-Blur-your-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Blur your Background"></a>2. How to Blur your Background</h4><p>Place your subject – in the case of a vlog, your subject is probably yourself – in a shallow depth of field, and they will remain sharply in focus while everything behind them is blurred.</p><p>If the subject is yourself, you might need a helper to either operate your camera or stand in for you while you set up your camera. You will need to be able to check that the place you plan to stand or sit is in focus.</p><p>To get a shallow depth of field, make sure your aperture is wide. Do this by setting a low f-stop.

YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube.

It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family. You might also use an unlisted video to test out a new idea before making it public on the video-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>Age-Restricted Videos</strong>: Age-restricted videos on YouTube are not suitable for all audiences. It may contain content that includes violence, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate material. YouTube requires that users be at least 18 years old to view these types of videos.</p><p>If you search on YouTube and come across an age-restricted video, you will be asked to confirm your age before viewing its content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/age-restricted-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="age restricted video on youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos"></a>How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now that we’ve learned about the four types of YouTube content, let’s discuss how you can find unlisted YouTube videos:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?"></a>How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?</h3><p>Since <strong>unavailable videos in YouTube playlists are hidden</strong> from general public viewers, you cannot find them on YouTube or Google search results.</p><p>However, the following workaround can help you watch these YouTube videos without facing much trouble:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://unlistedvideos.com/" >Unlisted Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website.

YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png"                      alt="private video on youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Unlisted Video</strong> Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family. You might also use an unlisted video to test out a new idea before making it public on the video-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>Age-Restricted Videos</strong>: Age-restricted videos on YouTube are not suitable for all audiences. It may contain content that includes violence, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate material. YouTube requires that users be at least 18 years old to view these types of videos.</p><p>If you search on YouTube and come across an age-restricted video, you will be asked to confirm your age before viewing its content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/age-restricted-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="age restricted video on youtube"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-2"><a href="#How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos"></a>How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now that we’ve learned about the four types of YouTube content, let’s discuss how you can find unlisted YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-2"><a href="#How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?"></a>How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?</h3><p>Since <strong>unavailable videos in YouTube playlists are hidden</strong> from general public viewers, you cannot find them on YouTube or Google search results.</p><p>However, the following workaround can help you watch these YouTube videos without facing much trouble:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://unlistedvideos.com/" >Unlisted Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website.

YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:</p><p><strong>Public Videos:</strong> YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.</p><p>So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: “<strong>Public</strong> <strong>Videos</strong>.” It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.</p><p><strong>Private Videos</strong>: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video’s shareable link can watch it.</p><p>Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.absolute.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4601998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ef70e26a0b5da778eda3f48014d087cd/728x90_larger-shield.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png"                      alt="private video on youtube"                ></p><p><strong>Unlisted Video</strong> Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.</p><p>You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family. You might also use an unlisted video to test out a new idea before making it public on the video-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>Age-Restricted Videos</strong>: Age-restricted videos on YouTube are not suitable for all audiences. It may contain content that includes violence, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate material. YouTube requires that users be at least 18 years old to view these types of videos.</p><p>If you search on YouTube and come across an age-restricted video, you will be asked to confirm your age before viewing its content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/age-restricted-videos-on-youtube.png"                      alt="age restricted video on youtube"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37540879&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://paperscan.orpalis.com/img/content/You_prefer_to_use.png"                      border="0"                >PaperScan Professional： PaperScan Scanner Software is a powerful TWAIN &amp; WIA scanning application centered on one idea: making document acquisition an unparalleled easy task for anyone.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-3"><a href="#How-To-Find-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos"></a>How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos</h2><p>Now that we’ve learned about the four types of YouTube content, let’s discuss how you can find unlisted YouTube videos:</p><h3 id="How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-3"><a href="#How-To-Find-Other-People’s-Unlisted-YouTube-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?"></a>How To Find Other People’s Unlisted YouTube Videos?</h3><p>Since <strong>unavailable videos in YouTube playlists are hidden</strong> from general public viewers, you cannot find them on YouTube or Google search results.</p><p>However, the following workaround can help you watch these YouTube videos without facing much trouble:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a class="link"   href="https://unlistedvideos.com/" >Unlisted Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website.

This is especially important when teaching on tough subjects or when reviewing for exams.</li><li><strong>Short clips to put a topic in context</strong> – there are documentary channels such as National Geographic, BBC and Channel 4 amongst others where teachers can obtain and play short clips to put the subject matter into proper context for the students.</li><li><strong>Archive your work</strong>– use videos to keep a clean and neat record of the various lessons thus making it easy for current and future students to access them with ease.</li><li><strong>Review for exams</strong> – when exams are just about the corner, videos become very effective in helping the student to refresh their minds on tough topics that might require a lot of time to review during exams.</li><li><strong>Flip lessons</strong>– flipped learning is taking strong roots in most of the learning institutions and it becomes easy and efficient when using videos in the classroom.</li><li><strong>Teach when you are absent</strong> – instead of missing class or having a guest teacher to stand in for you, you can simply record the lesson on your YouTube channel or simply give out instructions for the students to follow when you are away.</li><li><strong>Allow students to gain in-depth information</strong>– by using YouTube in classroom, teachers are essentially allowing their students to dig deeper and comprehend the lessons better.</li><li><strong>Help the struggling students</strong> – videos are great for the slow learners since they can rewind or play it at their own pace.</li><li><strong>Create a YouTube Channel</strong> – this is to contain all the videos relevant to a particular subject or lesion for current and future students.</li></ol><h2 id="How-to-discover-the-best-educational-videos-on-YouTube-3"><a href="#How-to-discover-the-best-educational-videos-on-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="How to discover the best educational videos on YouTube"></a>How to discover the best educational videos on YouTube</h2><p> YouTube is awash with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >millions of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it is imperative that you know how to search for and discover the best education videos.

The number of gamers is growing every day, and that means more and more people are looking for content from experienced gamers on YouTube and Twitch. To produce great YouTube gaming videos, you’ll need a lot of gaming knowledge and a few pieces of high-quality equipment, including a good headset. Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.</p><p>Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:</p><p> <strong><a href="#razer">1.

The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p><p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset-2"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p><p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430-2"><a href="#3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.</p><p>Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:</p><p> <strong><a href="#razer">1.

The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p><p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset-3"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p><p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430-3"><a href="#3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p><p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p><p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p><h2 id="4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset-3"><a href="#4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p><p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle.

If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name" class="headerlink" title="3.

Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="4.

You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like.

This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular.

Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name-2"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule-2"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like.

The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic. If you are considering starting your own YouTube channel then you should take a second to consider why you want to, since this will have an impact on what kind of videos you make. Your reasons for wanting to make a YouTube account do not have to be very elaborate. Maybe you just think it will be fun. Good news; it will be!</p><p>Once you know for sure that you want to create a YouTube account, and also know why you want to do it, you have already started building your channel. There are still a few important things to consider, though.

Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p><p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"                      alt="account sign in screen"                ></p><p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account new gmail"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-after-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account after new gmail"                ></p><p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p><p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p><p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p><p>6.

Here are some of the ways for teachers to use YouTube in classrooms-:</p><ol><li><strong>Trigger unique and interesting discussions</strong>– teachers using YouTube in the classrooms can trigger interesting and unique discussions amongst their students.

This is especially important when teaching on tough subjects or when reviewing for exams.</li><li><strong>Short clips to put a topic in context</strong> – there are documentary channels such as National Geographic, BBC and Channel 4 amongst others where teachers can obtain and play short clips to put the subject matter into proper context for the students.</li><li><strong>Archive your work</strong>– use videos to keep a clean and neat record of the various lessons thus making it easy for current and future students to access them with ease.</li><li><strong>Review for exams</strong> – when exams are just about the corner, videos become very effective in helping the student to refresh their minds on tough topics that might require a lot of time to review during exams.</li><li><strong>Flip lessons</strong>– flipped learning is taking strong roots in most of the learning institutions and it becomes easy and efficient when using videos in the classroom.</li><li><strong>Teach when you are absent</strong> – instead of missing class or having a guest teacher to stand in for you, you can simply record the lesson on your YouTube channel or simply give out instructions for the students to follow when you are away.</li><li><strong>Allow students to gain in-depth information</strong>– by using YouTube in classroom, teachers are essentially allowing their students to dig deeper and comprehend the lessons better.</li><li><strong>Help the struggling students</strong> – videos are great for the slow learners since they can rewind or play it at their own pace.</li><li><strong>Create a YouTube Channel</strong> – this is to contain all the videos relevant to a particular subject or lesion for current and future students.</li></ol><h2 id="How-to-discover-the-best-educational-videos-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-discover-the-best-educational-videos-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to discover the best educational videos on YouTube"></a>How to discover the best educational videos on YouTube</h2><p> YouTube is awash with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >millions of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it is imperative that you know how to search for and discover the best education videos.

Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top"

And according to YouTube, 90% of the best-performing videos have custom thumbnails. Therefore, adding thumbnails to all your videos is wise. But how to do that with live streams? Is it any different from adding thumbnails to normal videos? You’ll find answers in this article. Here’s a comprehensive guide about <strong>YouTube Live thumbnails.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-live-thumbnail.gif"                      alt="guide to youtube live thumbnail"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Overview-of-YouTube-Live"><a href="#Overview-of-YouTube-Live" class="headerlink" title="Overview of YouTube Live"></a>Overview of YouTube Live</h2><p>Livestreaming is very popular now. The pandemic has accelerated its growth. But what made it so special? Watching live streams is different from watching regular videos. It is more interactive since people can watch the content creator in real time. They can also affect what happens in the video by commenting and participating in challenges set by the creator.</p><p>That said, live streaming helps build a better connection between content creators and their audiences. So you may want to incorporate live streaming into your strategies. You can do that on YouTube through YouTube Live. You can use this feature to host virtual events, do live Q&amp;A, play games with your viewers, and more.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Importance-of-Thumbnail-for-Live-Stream"><a href="#Importance-of-Thumbnail-for-Live-Stream" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Thumbnail for Live Stream"></a>Importance of Thumbnail for Live Stream</h2><p>Thumbnails are important for videos. Alongside the title, they inform the viewers what the video is about. It’s not different with live streams. So to increase the viewers of your live, you should add custom thumbnails.</p><p>What happens if you don’t add a custom thumbnail to your live stream? YouTube will select a random frame from the video and display it. The thing is that live streams are usually longer than recorded videos. So YouTube has more options to use as the thumbnail.</p><p>The problem is that most of those frames are not suitable to be used as the video cover. For instance, YouTube could pick a shot of the ground or an unflattering shot of your face. So, it’s a must to add a custom thumbnail for your live stream.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=195080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrwonder/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >With Screensaver Wonder you can easily make a screensaver from your own pictures and video files.

There are also a lot of ways in which it is different. You always have to watch out for camera shake, for example, but it can be even harder to control when you’re walking around shooting on your mobile device. Here are three things to keep in mind when vlogging with your smartphone.</p><h4 id="Part-1-Keep-It-Steady"><a href="#Part-1-Keep-It-Steady" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Keep It Steady"></a>Part 1. Keep It Steady</h4><p> For a nice, smooth, shot consider resting your hand up on a railing, table, or anything else that will keep it steady while you film. Camera shake is always distracting to viewers, and smartphone videos are notoriously unstable because you are almost always holding your phone in your hand.</p><p> There is equipment you can use to cut out camera shake. You can get a smartphone mount for your tripod, or you can even stabilize your phone using a selfie stick. Many of the very newest smartphones have built in hardware called ‘OIS’ – optical image stabilization – that helps reduce shakiness.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Be-Heard"><a href="#Part-2-Be-Heard" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Be Heard"></a>Part 2. Be Heard</h4><p> You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you say it! Smartphones do not tend to have very good microphones built in (neither do most cameras), so try to vlog from somewhere without a lot of background noise. It will help a lot if your voice has nothing to compete with.</p><p> Ideally, you should get an external mic to record your voice while you vlog on your phone. There are shotgun mics you can plug directly into the audio jack on your phone which will record great audio, or you can get a high quality MP3 recorder and carry it around in your pocket.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tilt Your Phone"></a>Part 3. Tilt Your Phone</h4><p> When recording on the spur of the moment with your smartphone it is easy to automatically hold it the same way you would while texting or taking a selfie. If you record a video with your phone held so that it is tall – a ‘portrait’ shot – then your video will have thick black bars on either side when you post it to YouTube. If you tilt your phone so that it is wide you will record a ‘landscape’ shot, which will match the dimensions YouTube plays videos in.</p><p> The exception to this is videos you plan to post on Instagram. On Instagram everything is cropped into a square, and it is easier to imagine what your footage will look like as a square when you hold your phone strait up. Simply focus on the top of your screen and treat a portion of the bottom of your screen as if it is not there. When you hold your phone horizontally you need to try and estimate how much of the middle of your screen will make it in to your Instagram video, which can be awkward.</p><p> Those are the three main things to keep in mind, but if you are planning on posting directly to YouTube from your phone then you should also make sure you have a mobile app you can use to edit it first.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a full-feature video editing app available for both Android and iPhone operating systems.

Keep It Steady"></a>Part 1. Keep It Steady</h4><p> For a nice, smooth, shot consider resting your hand up on a railing, table, or anything else that will keep it steady while you film. Camera shake is always distracting to viewers, and smartphone videos are notoriously unstable because you are almost always holding your phone in your hand.</p><p> There is equipment you can use to cut out camera shake. You can get a smartphone mount for your tripod, or you can even stabilize your phone using a selfie stick. Many of the very newest smartphones have built in hardware called ‘OIS’ – optical image stabilization – that helps reduce shakiness.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Be-Heard-2"><a href="#Part-2-Be-Heard-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Be Heard"></a>Part 2. Be Heard</h4><p> You have a lot to say, so make sure people can hear you say it! Smartphones do not tend to have very good microphones built in (neither do most cameras), so try to vlog from somewhere without a lot of background noise. It will help a lot if your voice has nothing to compete with.</p><p> Ideally, you should get an external mic to record your voice while you vlog on your phone. There are shotgun mics you can plug directly into the audio jack on your phone which will record great audio, or you can get a high quality MP3 recorder and carry it around in your pocket.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone-2"><a href="#Part-3-Tilt-Your-Phone-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tilt Your Phone"></a>Part 3. Tilt Your Phone</h4><p> When recording on the spur of the moment with your smartphone it is easy to automatically hold it the same way you would while texting or taking a selfie. If you record a video with your phone held so that it is tall – a ‘portrait’ shot – then your video will have thick black bars on either side when you post it to YouTube. If you tilt your phone so that it is wide you will record a ‘landscape’ shot, which will match the dimensions YouTube plays videos in.</p><p> The exception to this is videos you plan to post on Instagram. On Instagram everything is cropped into a square, and it is easier to imagine what your footage will look like as a square when you hold your phone strait up. Simply focus on the top of your screen and treat a portion of the bottom of your screen as if it is not there. When you hold your phone horizontally you need to try and estimate how much of the middle of your screen will make it in to your Instagram video, which can be awkward.</p><p> Those are the three main things to keep in mind, but if you are planning on posting directly to YouTube from your phone then you should also make sure you have a mobile app you can use to edit it first.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a full-feature video editing app available for both Android and iPhone operating systems.

After all, it lets us narrate our story via two (or more) screens and gives our audience a superior viewing experience. Though, a lot of users find it hard to implement the split-screen effect on YouTube videos. Here, I will let you know how to come up with all kinds of YouTube split-screen videos by using a professional video editor.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Diverse-Applications-of-Split-screen-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-The-Diverse-Applications-of-Split-screen-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos"></a>Part 1: The Diverse Applications of Split-screen Videos</h2><p>Before we discuss how to work on YouTube split-screen videos, let’s quickly consider some major applications of this video effect.</p><ul><li><h3 id="To-draw-a-direct-comparison"><a href="#To-draw-a-direct-comparison" class="headerlink" title="To draw a direct comparison"></a>To draw a direct comparison</h3></li></ul><p>One of the most popular applications of split-screen videos is for comparing two or more instances or perspectives in the same frame. For example, you might wish to depict the lifestyle of two people from different parts of the world or simply compare the effect of various seasons in a single video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-1.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives"><a href="#To-provide-two-or-more-perspectives" class="headerlink" title="To provide two or more perspectives"></a>To provide two or more perspectives</h3></li></ul><p>Videos are the best visual storytelling tools and just like any story, they can also have different perspectives. Ideally, the split-screen effect would be one of the best ways to show your audience all kinds of perspectives that can take place in your story.</p><p>One of the best examples was depicted in the movie “500 Days of Summer” in which we got several Expectations vs. Reality shots. These split-screen shots depicted the two major perspectives of the story in a single frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-2.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-implement-the-cloning-effect"><a href="#To-implement-the-cloning-effect" class="headerlink" title="To implement the cloning effect"></a>To implement the cloning effect</h3></li></ul><p>Have you ever wondered how filmmakers create a clone of a person in movies? To do that, we make the protagonist record both the scenes in front of the same background.

Ideally, the split-screen effect would be one of the best ways to show your audience all kinds of perspectives that can take place in your story.</p><p>One of the best examples was depicted in the movie “500 Days of Summer” in which we got several Expectations vs. Reality shots. These split-screen shots depicted the two major perspectives of the story in a single frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-youtube-split-screen-video-2.jpg"                      alt="split screen video"                ></p><ul><li><h3 id="To-implement-the-cloning-effect-3"><a href="#To-implement-the-cloning-effect-3" class="headerlink" title="To implement the cloning effect"></a>To implement the cloning effect</h3></li></ul><p>Have you ever wondered how filmmakers create a clone of a person in movies?

(example: Daily vlogs, commentary, etc.)</p><h4 id="Inspire-Your-Audience"><a href="#Inspire-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Inspire Your Audience"></a><strong>Inspire Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience might be looking for a community to support them as they attempt a new goal. YouTube is a great platform to encourage others to do their best and achieve more. (example: 30-day challenges, motivational talks, etc.)</p><p>Don’t pick a niche simply because of general interest in a topic. If your niche comes to you in a flash and you go: “That’s a good idea,” before you set up your YouTube channel and commit to this video project, sit down, do some research, write out a script, and actually film the initial video. Go through the process and know what you are getting into.</p><p>Once you have a niche, it’s all about coming up with ideas for your video.

(example: How-tos, product reviews, etc.)</p><h4 id="Entertain-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#Entertain-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Entertain Your Audience"></a><strong>Entertain Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience wants to be entertained. Remember, when a viewer is watching your content, they are choosing it over all the books, movies, and music in the world. You have their attention, so don’t be boring. (example: Daily vlogs, commentary, etc.)</p><h4 id="Inspire-Your-Audience-3"><a href="#Inspire-Your-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Inspire Your Audience"></a><strong>Inspire Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Your audience might be looking for a community to support them as they attempt a new goal. YouTube is a great platform to encourage others to do their best and achieve more. (example: 30-day challenges, motivational talks, etc.)</p><p>Don’t pick a niche simply because of general interest in a topic. If your niche comes to you in a flash and you go: “That’s a good idea,” before you set up your YouTube channel and commit to this video project, sit down, do some research, write out a script, and actually film the initial video. Go through the process and know what you are getting into.</p><p>Once you have a niche, it’s all about coming up with ideas for your video.

More than 5 billion videos are watched every single minute on YouTube. And the ever-growing user base has propelled YouTube to the status of 2nd most popular social media platform in the world, and the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >second most visited website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after Google in 2021.</p><p>YouTube marketing is great for both businesses and individuals who want to make careers out of YouTube. Many businesses make use of YouTube ads to get their products to their customers and it’s really effective. However, you can make more organic traffic using YouTube video marketing. With a successful YouTube video marketing strategy, you can generate leads without any ad investments.</p><p>And in this guide, we will discuss some YouTube video marketing tips that will help you get more subscribers and build your brand outreach.</p><h2 id="Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal"><a href="#Tip-1-Create-A-Roadmap-Leading-To-Your-Main-Goal" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal"></a><strong>Tip #1: Create A Roadmap Leading To Your Main Goal</strong></h2><p>A roadmap is basically a level by level approach to your vision. Instead of just looking at the end plan, you are building your platform up through short attainable goals. There is immense power in setting short term goals. Some serious questions that you should ask yourself are:</p><p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Start with the question of why you need a YouTube channel in the first place! Decide on what your channel should be about and how the viewers are going to benefit from it.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> The next step is to prepare a content plan. Here must decide the type of videos and how often it will be published on your channel.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong> What is your target in terms of subscribers and traffic conversion. Do you plan to take the audience to a separate landing or are you planning on making money solely from YouTube?</p><p>Planning out such specifics will help you build your platform gradually to the main goal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35504869&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/1_FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro Annually -  Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-2-Do-tests-within-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy"></a><strong>Tip #2: Do tests within your strategy</strong></h2><p>Understanding the audience preferences is paramount to the success of YouTube channels. There are some important tests that you can do to understand the genre that you are targeting.</p><h3 id="a-Test-video-duration"><a href="#a-Test-video-duration" class="headerlink" title="a. Test video duration"></a>a. Test video duration</h3><p>Nobody likes to see a 2 hour long YouTube video unless it’s super interesting. Thankfully, there have been <a class="link"   href="https://www.minimatters.com/youtube-best-video-length/" >studies <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that have been conducted to measure the audience reaction to videos of different lengths.</p><p>By default, when you create a YouTube account, the maximum upload length is restricted to just 15 minutes. You can go past this limit by verifying your account on YouTube.</p><p>When you look at the most trending videos on YouTube, they generally fall within 10 minutes. The average video size on YouTube is 4.4 minutes .</p><p>For example, let us look at YouTube videos that explain the same concept, but with different video lengths and see if the audience engagement differs with the videos. we have ensured that both videos are from channels who have a similar subscriber count in order to eliminate disproportionality that arises from viewer base.</p><p>This video gives an excellent explanation of the string theory. The Video is From TED-Ed and you can see the audience response in the comments where they praise Physicist Brian Greene for his talk. Note that the video has 2.4 million views.</p><p>Now, look at the above video that explains String Theory in less than half the time from TED-Ed. Notice how the video has more than four times the views with an impressive 10 million views. It comes to show that if you can condense your content in such a way that you can get the maximum meaning across in minimum time, you will rack up more views!</p><h3 id="b-Test-different-formats-scenarios"><a href="#b-Test-different-formats-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios"></a>b. Test different formats&#x2F;scenarios</h3><p>Having a monotonous nature throughout your videos can be quite tiring for the viewer after some time. Make sure to mix things up a bit by introducing new types of video formats or scenarios that keeps the users engaged.</p><p>Such a format change will also be invaluable in testing the audience reaction to the different types of videos that you make. These new formats can be in the form of a separate video series that is different from your main content. It can also be something that directly engages the viewers like a live video stream, Ask Me Anything or Q&amp;A type of content, etc.</p><p>For example, let us take one among the most popular cooking channels on YouTube – Tasty. If you were to browse through their content, you can see how they got their fame with cookery videos that are short and sweet like the one below:</p><p>However, they do not just stick to that same format all the time. you can also see how they mix in lengthier videos of different format. For example:</p><p>And many videos that aren’t specifically cooking at all!</p><p>And it is evident that these new formats have also become crowd favorites. Now do all their videos hit the 1 million mark? No, that just shows they are constantly testing out the waters go ahead with what works and discard what doesn’t!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/MacBook_Pro_lyrx-withsinger-tv.png"                      border="0"                >LYRX is an easy-to-use karaoke software with the professional features karaoke hosts need to perform with precision.

Try Giveaways and gifts"></a>c. Try Giveaways and gifts</h3><p>You can boost the viewership and subscriber count for your channel by setting up occasional giveaways or gifts to the viewers. Make sure that you set the winning criteria to have the viewers subscribe to the channel.</p><p>For example, let’s take another popular YouTube channel Unbox Therapy. On Jun 27, 2018, the channel did an announcement that they were giving 106 OnePlus 6 smartphones!</p><p>And the result of the announcement was evident in the subscribers count.</p><p>From June 23rd to June 27th, 2018, Unbox therapy had gained 12,583 subscribers. However, from the announcement date that is June 27th to June 30th, 2018, the channel saw an increase of a whopping <a class="link"   href="https://www.trackalytics.com/youtube/user/unboxtherapy/" >52,173 subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!

However, sometimes what you may think would work might not fit well with the audience. Hence, it is imperative that you understand their likes and dislikes.</p><p>And the best way to improve your videos is to take suggestions from the audience themselves. You can ask them specific questions on how to improve your videos or what they want to see in your future creations. Take notes on what they have to offer and start building your content taking in those suggestions.</p><p>There is also another facet to incorporating audience feedback as it projects your YouTube channel to be responsive to the audience, something that is vital to building a strong and loyal viewer base on YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources"><a href="#Tip-4-Analyse-your-YouTube-videos-traffic-sources" class="headerlink" title="Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources"></a><strong>Tip #4: Analyse your YouTube videos traffic sources</strong></h2><p>YouTube has made it easier for you to track the sources from which your videos are getting the views. Sign in to YouTube Studio Beta and the click Reach from the Analytics menu provided on the left panel. Now click on Traffic source types.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Analytics"                ></p><p>In this window, you can see the different sources that led viewers to your video. Generally, it can be a mix of websites, YouTube recommendation’s, YouTube search, etc. Metrics like Watch Time gives you an idea of how long viewers watch your videos and Audience Retention shows how consistent they are at watching them. These are just two of the many metrics you can use to your advantage.</p><p>Analyzing YouTube videos will help you structure your future videos in a way that it is more susceptible to being clicked.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos"><a href="#Tip-5-Track-the-effectiveness-of-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos"></a><strong>Tip #5: Track the effectiveness of your videos</strong></h2><p>You must have an eye on the metrics that your videos garner over the days. While the number of views, likes, and dislikes are great indicators in determining the popularity of the videos, but there are many more factors at play.</p><p>Your video ranking is important as it determines the position of your videos when a keyword is typed into the search box. The ranks are calculated by the YouTube algorithm, but you have a certain degree of power in raising the ranks by leveraging the following parameters of the video;</p><p><strong><em>Thumbnail:</em></strong> The first thing that the viewer is going it see when they are browsing through a list of videos is the thumbnail. Make sure that it is attractive and stands out!</p><p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> The next element that gets the most attention from both the user and the YouTube algorithm is the title. Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p><p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail. Be very descriptive about your video, but do not just use a big chunk of text. The description must be succinct and informative. It can also have links to your landing page or sponsors.</p><p><strong><em>Tags:</em></strong> Tags are words or phrases that are used to help YouTube better understand the video. Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p><p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p><p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p><p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort. Having a rank tracker like the one from <a class="link"   href="https://seranking.com/position-tracking.html" >SE Ranking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/tools#keywordranktracking" >Tubebuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be quite handy at times like these.

While the number of views, likes, and dislikes are great indicators in determining the popularity of the videos, but there are many more factors at play.</p><p>Your video ranking is important as it determines the position of your videos when a keyword is typed into the search box. The ranks are calculated by the YouTube algorithm, but you have a certain degree of power in raising the ranks by leveraging the following parameters of the video;</p><p><strong><em>Thumbnail:</em></strong> The first thing that the viewer is going it see when they are browsing through a list of videos is the thumbnail. Make sure that it is attractive and stands out!</p><p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> The next element that gets the most attention from both the user and the YouTube algorithm is the title. Ensure that the main keyword you are targeting is included in the title.</p><p><strong><em>Description:</em></strong> This is where you can play a lot with keywords, both short and long tail. Be very descriptive about your video, but do not just use a big chunk of text. The description must be succinct and informative. It can also have links to your landing page or sponsors.</p><p><strong><em>Tags:</em></strong> Tags are words or phrases that are used to help YouTube better understand the video. Make sure the tags that you are giving are related to the video that they represent.</p><p><strong><em>Category:</em></strong> YouTube has some predefined categories and the videos that you upload must be put in the right one to get maximum reach.</p><p><strong><em>Subtitles:</em></strong> Subtitles do not carry much weight in terms of SEO or ranking, but they are a much-appreciated addition in the audience point of view.</p><p>Yes, it can be quite meticulous but the results are worth the effort. Having a rank tracker like the one from <a class="link"   href="https://seranking.com/position-tracking.html" >SE Ranking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/tools#keywordranktracking" >Tubebuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be quite handy at times like these.

You had to accumulate over 1,000 subscribers and over 4,000 public watch hours. This can be difficult to attain, especially on a platform where creators are publishing new content every day. However, the 2023 update on the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) provided an easier way to start making money on YouTube. In this article, we look at how the YPP is changing and the beauty of the YouTube monetization 500 subscribers’ policy update.</p><p><strong>YouTube Shorts Monetization</strong> A cross-platform for helping you present your content in the best way possible<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Free Download"                > <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-YouTube-Monetization-Revamp-500-Subscribers-Minimum-Threshold-Unveiled"><a href="#Part-1-YouTube-Monetization-Revamp-500-Subscribers-Minimum-Threshold-Unveiled" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. YouTube Monetization Revamp: 500 Subscribers Minimum Threshold Unveiled"></a><strong>Part 1.</strong> <strong>YouTube Monetization Revamp: 500 Subscribers Minimum Threshold Unveiled</strong></h2><p>The recent update in YouTube monetization requirements has made it easier than ever for small creators to make money on the platform. The YPP program changed and reduced the number of subscribers needed to be eligible. It has also reduced the amount of watch time needed. Let’s have a look at what the new eligibility criteria look like:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/unlock-youtube-monetization-with-500-subscribers-1.JPG"                      alt="new eligibility criteria"                ></p><p>The eligibility criteria for the YPP program are now easier and more achievable than before. To apply, you now need:</p><ul><li>At least 500 subscribers</li><li>Three Shorts or Video uploads in the last 90 days</li><li>At least 3,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or</li><li>At least 3 million public Short videos in the last 90 days</li></ul><p>The new requirements are lower than the old ones. Previously, you were required to have at least 1,000 subscribers with over 4,000 public watch hours. By lowering the threshold, YouTube makes it easier for all creators to monetize their content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Monetization-with-500-Subscribers-A-Brief-Guide"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Monetization-with-500-Subscribers-A-Brief-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

YouTube Monetization with 500 Subscribers: A Brief Guide</strong></h2><p>YouTube announced in 2022 that they were evolving the YPP to continue rewarding more creators. Starting mid-June 2023, the program was expanded to allow more creators to access monetization benefits.</p><h3 id="Know-If-You-are-Eligible"><a href="#Know-If-You-are-Eligible" class="headerlink" title="Know If You are Eligible"></a><strong>Know If You are Eligible</strong></h3><p>As a creator, you will want to know if you are eligible for the YouTube monetization 500 subscribers’ plan. Make sure that the notify feature on your channel is active to receive a notification. Go to the Earn area of the YouTube channel, and select Get Notified. Once selected, YouTube will send you an email when reach above the eligibility threshold.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=195080&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrwonder/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >With Screensaver Wonder you can easily make a screensaver from your own pictures and video files.

Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up"></a>1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>Don’t have a lot of space to set up your camera and lighting equipment? No problem! You can be within an arm’s length away from your camera with a close quarters wide-angle vlog set-up.</p><p>With this set-up, you’re going to need a camera with a wide-angle lens, a tripod, a camera-mounted shotgun mic for sound, and a ring light for light.</p><p>Set your camera on the tripod and mount the shotgun mic directly on the camera shoe (the electronic bracket on the top of the camera). Inside the circular space of your ring light, position your camera right in the middle of it so that you can shoot your video through it without getting any part of the lighting equipment in your shot.</p><p>In the video above, Sean Cannell demonstrates this set-up. As you can see from this example, the wide-angle lens is able to squeeze in a lot of what’s in front of the camera into the shot.</p><p>Objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame will appear more stretched out as the wide-angle causes distortion and enhances perspectives.</p><p>If you look closely into Sean’s eyes, you can also see a specular highlight in the shape of a circle. Many people like the way eyes look against a ring light.</p><h3 id="2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up"></a>2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you have more space and want to shoot a more professional-looking talking-head shot with more realistic perspectives, a medium vlog set-up may be a better alternative for you.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll be using a slightly longer standard&#x2F;normal lens (like a 35mm or a 50mm lens) attached to your camera which would be set on a tripod. Since this longer lens will show less of the surrounding areas as it “zooms” closer into whatever is in front, you will need to sit further back, away from your camera.</p><p>Now that you’re further away from your camera, a camera-mounted shotgun mic may not be the best mic for you. For better sound recording, you’ll need a shotgun mic fixed on a mic stand that is set up like a boom mic, positioned just outside of your camera frame.</p><p>At the 39 second mark of the above video, electronic music producer deadmau5 is positioned right in the center of this particular set-up.</p><p>You can see from how even the background and couch looks across the entire camera frame that there is no distortion or enhanced perspective.</p><p>It appears that, to the right of deadmau5 (camera left), there is a key light and to his left (camera right) there may be a fill light for additional lighting. Behind the couch, there’s also a background uplight to create depth between the subject and the background. At the 1:30 mark of this trailer video, you can briefly see how the Masterclass camera crew set up their shot.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657397/16446" target="_top" id="1657397"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657397"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657397/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#3-Two-Person-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up"></a>3.  Two Person Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If your talking-head shot has got to include two people, you can use a similar set-up as the medium vlog set-up detailed above.</p><p>If you look back at the 39-second mark of deadmau5’s Masterclass trailer, you can see that there’s a lot of space to the left and right of deadmau5. Now imagine the same shot but with two people.</p><p>With two people, though, you’ll want to set up your mic slightly differently. Rather than using a directional shotgun mic with a narrow area of sensitivity, you’ll want to use a directional mic with a wider area of sensitivity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up"><a href="#4-Long-Teleprompter-Vlog-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up"></a>4.  Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you want to read over a script but still make it appear like you’re looking straight into the camera, you’ll need to use a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll need all the same equipment as the medium vlog set-up, but you’ll additionally need a teleprompter placed in front of your camera equipped with a long telephoto lens.</p><p>You will have to sit much further back away from your camera for two main reasons. Firstly, you want to be able to fit yourself in your much more zoomed-in camera frame (effect of the long telephoto lens). Secondly, you want to be far enough that the camera cannot detect your eyes reading from left to right. You’ll want to be around six meters away from a 17” teleprompter monitor or around four meters away from a 10” teleprompter monitor.</p><p>In the above video, Jared Polin uses a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>In the video, he says there’s about 8 feet (2.4 meters) between himself and his lens. At the 1:15 mark of his video, Jared demonstrates how this set-up works.</p><p>It is difficult to know whether the movement in his eyes is caused by not being far enough from the lens or from his horizontal nystagmus condition in his eyes.</p><p>Looking to find the right lights for your video recording set?

Long Teleprompter Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you want to read over a script but still make it appear like you’re looking straight into the camera, you’ll need to use a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll need all the same equipment as the medium vlog set-up, but you’ll additionally need a teleprompter placed in front of your camera equipped with a long telephoto lens.</p><p>You will have to sit much further back away from your camera for two main reasons. Firstly, you want to be able to fit yourself in your much more zoomed-in camera frame (effect of the long telephoto lens). Secondly, you want to be far enough that the camera cannot detect your eyes reading from left to right. You’ll want to be around six meters away from a 17” teleprompter monitor or around four meters away from a 10” teleprompter monitor.</p><p>In the above video, Jared Polin uses a long teleprompter vlog set-up.</p><p>In the video, he says there’s about 8 feet (2.4 meters) between himself and his lens. At the 1:15 mark of his video, Jared demonstrates how this set-up works.</p><p>It is difficult to know whether the movement in his eyes is caused by not being far enough from the lens or from his horizontal nystagmus condition in his eyes.</p><p>Looking to find the right lights for your video recording set?

Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up"></a>1.  Close Quarters Wide-Angle Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>Don’t have a lot of space to set up your camera and lighting equipment? No problem! You can be within an arm’s length away from your camera with a close quarters wide-angle vlog set-up.</p><p>With this set-up, you’re going to need a camera with a wide-angle lens, a tripod, a camera-mounted shotgun mic for sound, and a ring light for light.</p><p>Set your camera on the tripod and mount the shotgun mic directly on the camera shoe (the electronic bracket on the top of the camera). Inside the circular space of your ring light, position your camera right in the middle of it so that you can shoot your video through it without getting any part of the lighting equipment in your shot.</p><p>In the video above, Sean Cannell demonstrates this set-up. As you can see from this example, the wide-angle lens is able to squeeze in a lot of what’s in front of the camera into the shot.</p><p>Objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame will appear more stretched out as the wide-angle causes distortion and enhances perspectives.</p><p>If you look closely into Sean’s eyes, you can also see a specular highlight in the shape of a circle. Many people like the way eyes look against a ring light.</p><h3 id="2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up-2"><a href="#2-Medium-Vlog-Set-Up-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up"></a>2.  Medium Vlog Set-Up</h3><p>If you have more space and want to shoot a more professional-looking talking-head shot with more realistic perspectives, a medium vlog set-up may be a better alternative for you.</p><p>For this set-up, you’ll be using a slightly longer standard&#x2F;normal lens (like a 35mm or a 50mm lens) attached to your camera which would be set on a tripod. Since this longer lens will show less of the surrounding areas as it “zooms” closer into whatever is in front, you will need to sit further back, away from your camera.</p><p>Now that you’re further away from your camera, a camera-mounted shotgun mic may not be the best mic for you. For better sound recording, you’ll need a shotgun mic fixed on a mic stand that is set up like a boom mic, positioned just outside of your camera frame.</p><p>At the 39 second mark of the above video, electronic music producer deadmau5 is positioned right in the center of this particular set-up.</p><p>You can see from how even the background and couch looks across the entire camera frame that there is no distortion or enhanced perspective.</p><p>It appears that, to the right of deadmau5 (camera left), there is a key light and to his left (camera right) there may be a fill light for additional lighting. Behind the couch, there’s also a background uplight to create depth between the subject and the background.

About a month ago, you had to have 10,000 lifetime views on your YouTube channel to qualify for monetization. However, earlier this year, Google changed their eligibility requirements and made them even tougher.</p><p>As of February 20, 2018, YouTube channels need to have accumulated 4000 hours of ‘watch time’ over the past 12 months and no less than 1000 subscribers to qualify for monetization. If you do not meet these requirements you cannot join the YouTube Partner Program and monetize your YouTube channel.</p><p>So, the first step to successful monetization on YouTube is to actually grow your channel. You need to create videos that will attract viewers and engage your audience. You also need to get people to subscribe because this is really what will grow your YouTube channel over time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4729507&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/TIU/Nero_TuneItUp_Screen_2.webp"                      border="0"                >&#x2F;a&gt;</p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Enable-Monetization-for-Your-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Enable-Monetization-for-Your-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Enable Monetization for Your YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2: How To Enable Monetization for Your YouTube Channel</h2><p>Here’s the step-by-step process for monetizing your YouTube Channel, for those who are qualified.</p><ol><li>Log in to your YouTube account.</li><li>Find your account icon in the top right corner.

About a month ago, you had to have 10,000 lifetime views on your YouTube channel to qualify for monetization. However, earlier this year, Google changed their eligibility requirements and made them even tougher.</p><p>As of February 20, 2018, YouTube channels need to have accumulated 4000 hours of ‘watch time’ over the past 12 months and no less than 1000 subscribers to qualify for monetization. If you do not meet these requirements you cannot join the YouTube Partner Program and monetize your YouTube channel.</p><p>So, the first step to successful monetization on YouTube is to actually grow your channel. You need to create videos that will attract viewers and engage your audience.

The charismatic vlogger first joined YouTube on August 13, 2017, and uploaded his first gaming video on January 2018. Initially, Ujjwal used his elder brother’s phone to post gaming tutorial videos. This obviously limited his input on YouTube as he also had to set aside time for studying.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/techno-gamerz-youtube-income-2022-2.jpg"                      alt="techno gamerz youtube marketing"                ></p><p>But after seeing potential in what Techno Gamerz was doing, his brother encouraged him to post more often. His first viral video was for Dragon Ball Z, a downloading tutorial. This video garnered a massive 250K views, boosting his channel’s profile. The young YouTube star has never looked back since then.</p><p>Meantime, you must be asking yourself how YouTube generates income in India. It’s simple; via AdSense! YouTube’s RPM (Revenue Per Mile) metric per 1,000 views varies between countries. In India, the video-sharing platform pays $0.50 per 1,000 views. This means that Indian YouTube teachers and influencers can earn $500 after garnering 1 million views.</p><p>But nothing is cast in stone on YouTube. Most Indian channels can earn between $800 and $2,500 after reaching 1 million views. However, this depends on where you get the most views from. For example, if at least half of your views are from the US, you’ll earn at least $1,500. <strong>Techno Gamerz YouTube income</strong> per 1,000 views is approximately $1.21.</p><p>Remember that there are some conditions to meet before you start earning money on YouTube. First, the channel must be active for at least a year and have a minimum of 1,000 subscribers. That’s not all; you’ll need nothing less than 4,000 watch hours to be on YouTube’s payroll.</p><p>With that said, below are some YouTube stats about the <strong>Techno Gamerz monthly income</strong>, number of views, and more:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Estimated Monthly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</th><th>$167K</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Estimated Yearly earnings in USD&#x2F;Indian rupees</td><td>$8.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Total video uploads</td><td>858</td></tr><tr><td>Type of videos</td><td>Gaming tutorials</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td>29 million</td></tr><tr><td>Video views</td><td>7.5 billion</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 days’ views</td><td>7 million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As expected, Ujjwal Chaurasia has a massive following on other social media platforms, especially on Instagram.

For a long time, anybody who had an account in good standing could monetize their videos and start earning ad revenue, but now you need to have 10,000 views to qualify.</p><p>My first thought was that this isn’t fair. Small channels shouldn’t be barred from trying to earn money.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hard-to-become-youtube-partner.jpg"                      alt=" Become YouTube Partner should be easier"                ></p><p><em>I was prepared to go to war over this. Or do an angry blog post. One of those.</em></p><p>However, when you consider YouTube’s reasons for imposing this milestone, it actually starts to make a lot of sense. Here are 4 reasons why this will be a good thing for creators.</p><h4 id="1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number"><a href="#1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number" class="headerlink" title="1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number"></a>1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number</h4><p>This is actually a very do-able number for a smaller channel if the creator works hard at growing their audience. Remember that this is cumulative – you don’t need to get 10,000 views on a single video.</p><p>Say you receive about 100 views per video and post once a week. It would take you about 2 years to reach 10,000 at that rate, except that it wouldn’t because if you’re putting out good content on that reliable a schedule your channel will be growing (even if it’s slow).</p><p>If you get 500 views per video and post every week, you’ll reach 10,000 in about 5 months.</p><h4 id="2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money"><a href="#2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money" class="headerlink" title="2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money"></a>2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-views-on-youtube-hard.jpg"                      alt=" the weight of 10,00 views on YouTube"                ></p><p><em>Earning money from ad revenue has always been tough. This is just a little extra weight.</em></p><p>How much money could you earn off of 10,000 views, anyways? Not much.</p><p>You need to earn $50 in ad revenue to be paid out, and 10,000 views wouldn’t have gotten you there. You would have had to have passed this milestone anyways to actually see any money.</p><p>It’s too hard to put an exact number on the money you could have earned from your first 10,000 views – there are too many variables – but considering that smaller channels get lower-paying ads we’re probably talking about pocket change.</p><h4 id="3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized"><a href="#3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized" class="headerlink" title="3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized"></a>3. Inappropriate content won’t be monetized</h4><p>YouTube has been having issues with advertisers lately. A lot of brands have been justifiably miffed that their products are appearing next to some violent, threatening, objectively offensive content. Anyone could monetize, and some pretty bad eggs took advantage of that.</p><p>Now that channels will be applying for YouTube’s Partnership Program instead of simply activating the feature, there can be a real screening process. Channels with content that violates YouTube’s Community Guidelines can be barred from monetization.</p><h4 id="4-Thieves-won’t-profit"><a href="#4-Thieves-won’t-profit" class="headerlink" title="4. Thieves won’t profit"></a>4. Thieves won’t profit</h4><p>There are people out there who want views, subscribers, and nice comments but who do not want to put any real work into getting them. It isn’t uncommon for someone like this to download a video they like and post it to their own channel.</p><p>This reposted video will steal views and ad revenue away from the real post on the creator’s channel.</p><p>Having a review process for the Partnership Program will help ensure that these content thieves are caught before they can make any money.</p><p>YouTube also recently made it easier to report users for impersonation, regardless of how many views they have.</p><p><em>TheGamingGuy looked into people who had stolen his logo and found out they had also stolen whole videos from other YouTubers.</em></p><p>There are clear benefits to this new milestone, but there are also some questions remaining.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873305/18544" target="_top" id="1873305"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873305"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1350"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873305/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-does-this-change-stop-content-thieves-from-taking-views-and-ad-revenue-from-creators"><a href="#How-does-this-change-stop-content-thieves-from-taking-views-and-ad-revenue-from-creators" class="headerlink" title="How does this change stop content thieves from taking views and ad revenue from creators?"></a>How does this change stop content thieves from taking views and ad revenue from creators?</h2><p>It will help stop them from making money themselves, but not from siphoning away views from other channels. The impersonation rules only apply if somebody is pretending to be another creator. You can steal and repost someone’s content without pretending to be them.</p><p>This new rule does take away money as an incentive for stealing content, but a lot of people doing this probably aren’t in it for the money. They might just be misguided fans who want to repost videos they enjoy.</p><h2 id="Could-this-affect-your-CPM"><a href="#Could-this-affect-your-CPM" class="headerlink" title="Could this affect your CPM?"></a>Could this affect your CPM?</h2><p>Competition plays a huge role in how much YouTubers earn from ad revenue. Some genres are bigger on YouTube than others and, the more popular your genre is, the more options advertisers have. The more competition there is for higher-paying ads, the larger your channel has to be to get them.</p><p>Could this new milestone decrease competition in some genres?</p><p>Leave a comment to let me know what you think.

For a long time, anybody who had an account in good standing could monetize their videos and start earning ad revenue, but now you need to have 10,000 views to qualify.</p><p>My first thought was that this isn’t fair. Small channels shouldn’t be barred from trying to earn money.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hard-to-become-youtube-partner.jpg"                      alt=" Become YouTube Partner should be easier"                ></p><p><em>I was prepared to go to war over this.

Here are 4 reasons why this will be a good thing for creators.</p><h4 id="1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number-3"><a href="#1-10-000-isn’t-a-crazy-number-3" class="headerlink" title="1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number"></a>1. 10,000 isn’t a crazy number</h4><p>This is actually a very do-able number for a smaller channel if the creator works hard at growing their audience. Remember that this is cumulative – you don’t need to get 10,000 views on a single video.</p><p>Say you receive about 100 views per video and post once a week. It would take you about 2 years to reach 10,000 at that rate, except that it wouldn’t because if you’re putting out good content on that reliable a schedule your channel will be growing (even if it’s slow).</p><p>If you get 500 views per video and post every week, you’ll reach 10,000 in about 5 months.</p><h4 id="2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money-3"><a href="#2-10-000-views-aren’t-worth-much-money-3" class="headerlink" title="2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money"></a>2. 10,000 views aren’t worth much money</h4><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-views-on-youtube-hard.jpg"                      alt=" the weight of 10,00 views on YouTube"                ></p><p><em>Earning money from ad revenue has always been tough.

Not much.</p><p>You need to earn $50 in ad revenue to be paid out, and 10,000 views wouldn’t have gotten you there. You would have had to have passed this milestone anyways to actually see any money.</p><p>It’s too hard to put an exact number on the money you could have earned from your first 10,000 views – there are too many variables – but considering that smaller channels get lower-paying ads we’re probably talking about pocket change.</p><h4 id="3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized-3"><a href="#3-Inappropriate-content-won’t-be-monetized-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><h2 id="Why-Green"><a href="#Why-Green" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing. Modern technology has also evolved to optimize for a green background, making it a more practical choice for the chroma key effect.</p><p>Wardrobe and Set Design</p><p>Bright green occurs less naturally in costumes and set designs than other colors, making green the optimal choice for reducing the likelihood of color spill and keying issues. However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out.

This process typically follows a series of steps:</p><ul><li>Background Selection:</li></ul><p>A solid, single-color background, often green or blue, that contrasts well with the subject must be used. The color chosen should not be present in the subject or any props in the camera field to avoid unintentional transparency.</p><ul><li>Color Keying:</li></ul><p>This requires the use of specialized visual effects software to key out the chosen color. The green or blue background is designated as transparent, making everything of that color see-through. The software distinguishes between the keyed color and the subject, creating a mask for the transparent areas.</p><ul><li>Foreground Filming:</li></ul><p>This involves filming the subject against the <strong>live chroma key background</strong>. During filming, the chosen background color (green or blue) won’t appear in the final result due to its transparency. The subject is captured as if separately from the isolated background.</p><ul><li>Post-Processing:</li></ul><p>In post-production processing, the editor takes the keyed-out color and replaces it with the new background of their choice. This step creates the illusion that the subject is in a different setting or environment. The transparent areas become filled with the chosen background which, if done right, results in a cohesive and visually appealing composition.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Green-1"><a href="#Why-Green-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Green?"></a>Why Green?</h2><p>Theoretically, the <strong>chroma key background</strong> can be any solid color. However, the most commonly used colors are studio blue and bright green, with the latter far more common.</p><p>The choice of background color depends on the specific requirements of the production and the colors present in the scenes being filmed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Contrast</p><p>The less similar your chosen background color is to natural skin tones, the easier to isolate and replace in your footage. Bright green provides a strong contrast to most human skin tones and is less likely to be present in costumes or natural surroundings, making it easier to isolate subjects during the color separation.</p><p>Luminance</p><p> The color green emits light with greater intensity than blue, allowing for far more effective isolation by cameras during filming. This also means that blue screens demand increased lighting for proper exposure compared to green. This situation may be less than ideal if you lack powerful lighting or you don’t have the big bucks for them.</p><p>Digital Sensors</p><p> Many digital cameras and sensors are more sensitive to green wavelengths, resulting in cleaner and more accurate color keying during post-processing. Modern technology has also evolved to optimize for a green background, making it a more practical choice for the chroma key effect.</p><p>Wardrobe and Set Design</p><p>Bright green occurs less naturally in costumes and set designs than other colors, making green the optimal choice for reducing the likelihood of color spill and keying issues. However, if you know your scene will have lots of green, it is probably best to film with a blue screen, so there’s less risk of color spill and less post-production work.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio-1"><a href="#Setting-up-Your-Own-Chroma-Key-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio"></a>Setting up Your Own Chroma Key Studio</h2><p>Setting up your chroma key is convenient and straightforward, but there are some key factors to consider while setting up to ensure maximal performance.</p><p>Choosing the Right Background Color</p><p>The first step in the chroma key setup is selecting the right background color to be keyed out.

Because YouTube algorithms prefer to highlight YouTube videos that contain closed captions because such content appears universally acceptable and it helps to boost the experience for viewers. So when your YouTube video has some kind of relevant audio or speech information then it is essential to add closed captions (YouTube CC) to it.</p><h2 id="Benefits-of-Having-YouTube-CC-Always-On"><a href="#Benefits-of-Having-YouTube-CC-Always-On" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Having YouTube CC Always On"></a><strong>Benefits of Having YouTube CC Always On</strong></h2><p>YouTube CC can easily bring more viewers to your terminal. But not all users know how to turn it on or bother to turn it on when it can actually help improve the watching experience. So there are few benefits that you can enjoy by having CCs ALWAYS on your videos.</p><p>- Closed captions play an important role when you have poor audio quality in your videos. For instance, if your videos did not follow the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best audio recording practices <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and are affected by background noise or bad audio equipment. In such cases, YouTube subtitles help viewers to understand what is going on videos even if they cannot hear it.</p><p>- For those who make videos with a unique accent, discuss something complex, or speaks too fast, turning on the closed captions help your viewers understand explanations and maintain their attention.</p><p>- This feature makes videos more accessible and can also appear useful for viewers that are hearing impaired.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload
