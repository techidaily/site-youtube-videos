Your <strong>YouTube playback speed</strong> will increase by 0.25 as you keep tapping.</p><p>To reduce the <strong>playback speed YouTube</strong> videos, the reverse is the case. Press and hold down the shift tab, then tap less than the (&lt;) symbol.</p><p>Changing the playback speed using these keyboard shortcuts increases by 0.25 increments. You have to use custom if you want other values, as earlier mentioned.</p><p>The best thing about this method of changing the speed is that you can do it while watching the movie or while paused.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-YouTube’s-Video-Playback-Speed-on-Mobile"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-YouTube’s-Video-Playback-Speed-on-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change YouTube’s Video Playback Speed on Mobile"></a>Part 3: How to Change YouTube’s Video Playback Speed on Mobile</h2><p>If you’d like to know <strong>how to speed up YouTube videos</strong> on your Android, iPhone, or iPad, here’s it.</p><p>First, you must open your YouTube App on your device and play the video you want to watch.</p><p>Then tap the video once, and it will bring up the toolbar.</p><p>At the top right corner, select the vertically aligned three dots. This will bring out a menu for you—select playback speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-playback-speed-option-mobile.jpg"                      alt="youtube playback speed option mobile"                ></p><p>Then you will see a list containing the preset speed provided by YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-youtube-video-speed-mobile.jpg"                      alt="change youtube video speed mobile"                ></p><p>1 is the average speed. Any value below than 1 will slow down the video, while any value above it will increase it.</p><p>Once done, close the menu, and the video will resume from where it stopped.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-YouTube’s-Playback-Speed-Controls-Work"><a href="#Part-4-How-YouTube’s-Playback-Speed-Controls-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How YouTube’s Playback Speed Controls Work?"></a>Part 4: How YouTube’s Playback Speed Controls Work?</h2><p>YouTube has an added feature known as ‘playback speed.’ This feature allows you to select a speed from 0.25x to 2x the normal speed. With this <strong>YouTube’s speed control</strong>, 1 is the normal speed, with 0.25 being one-quarter (1&#x2F;4th) of the actual speed and slowing the video. In the same vein, 2x is twice the average speed, increasing the video speed.</p><p>However, in as much as <strong>YouTube speed control</strong> slows or speeds up the video, it does not change the pitch of the video. All it does is either expand or compress the video samples while still maintaining the video or audio pitch. It would still sound like the podcaster or video blogger is just talking faster or slower.</p><p>Music would still maintain the same musical key and pitch while playing faster or slower.</p><p>If you are watching a presentation or interview that seems like everyone is talking like they have all the time in the world, you can <strong>fast forward YouTube</strong> video by using the feature.</p><p>Also, you can slow down a tutorial or the video you are watching if you feel they are too fast using this <strong>YouTube speed control</strong>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>YouTube speed control</strong> has made it easier to change <strong>YouTube playback speed</strong> to either speed up or slow down the video. This enables you to capture important moments or information you may miss if the video was fast. Also, you can save time and get to the information you are searching for as soon as possible by speeding the YouTube video.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Change Video Speed with Keyboard Shortcuts on YouTube</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Change YouTube’s Video Playback Speed on Mobile</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How YouTube’s Playback Speed Controls Work?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Change a YouTube Video’s Speed Online</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Change-YouTube’s-Playback-Speed-on-Computer-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Change-YouTube’s-Playback-Speed-on-Computer-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Change YouTube’s Playback Speed on Computer"></a>Part 1: How to Change YouTube’s Playback Speed on Computer</h2><p>To <strong>fast-forward YouTube</strong> playback videos or slow it down on the computer, you must follow the proper steps.

With this <strong>YouTube’s speed control</strong>, 1 is the normal speed, with 0.25 being one-quarter (1&#x2F;4th) of the actual speed and slowing the video. In the same vein, 2x is twice the average speed, increasing the video speed.</p><p>However, in as much as <strong>YouTube speed control</strong> slows or speeds up the video, it does not change the pitch of the video. All it does is either expand or compress the video samples while still maintaining the video or audio pitch. It would still sound like the podcaster or video blogger is just talking faster or slower.</p><p>Music would still maintain the same musical key and pitch while playing faster or slower.</p><p>If you are watching a presentation or interview that seems like everyone is talking like they have all the time in the world, you can <strong>fast forward YouTube</strong> video by using the feature.</p><p>Also, you can slow down a tutorial or the video you are watching if you feel they are too fast using this <strong>YouTube speed control</strong>.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>YouTube speed control</strong> has made it easier to change <strong>YouTube playback speed</strong> to either speed up or slow down the video. This enables you to capture important moments or information you may miss if the video was fast. Also, you can save time and get to the information you are searching for as soon as possible by speeding the YouTube video.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Expert-Video-Making-Opt-for-Studio-Versus-Beta-Version"><a href="#Expert-Video-Making-Opt-for-Studio-Versus-Beta-Version" class="headerlink" title="Expert Video Making: Opt for Studio Versus Beta Version"></a>Expert Video Making: Opt for Studio Versus Beta Version</h2><h1 id="YouTube-Creator-Studio-vs-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Which-One-is-Better"><a href="#YouTube-Creator-Studio-vs-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Which-One-is-Better" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Creator Studio vs. YouTube Studio (Beta): Which One is Better?"></a>YouTube Creator Studio vs. YouTube Studio (Beta): Which One is Better?</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett"><a href="#Richard-Bennett" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>In 2017, <a class="link"   href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/youtube-vidcon-creators-2/" >YouTube revealed YouTube Studio Beta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a video management and analytics dashboard that will replace the classic Creator Studio that most YouTubers are familiar with by 2021.</p><p>In this article, we will look at the new features YouTube Studio Beta has, what we can expect from it in the future, and why YouTube will eventually phase out the older YouTube Creator Studio… and whether that change will be an improvement.</p><h3 id="Edit-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-YouTube-Videos-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit YouTube Videos with Filmora"></a>Edit YouTube Videos with Filmora</h3><p>As one of the most widely used video editing software in YouTube video editing, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides lots of templates and effects with an intuitive interface, which saves much time.

So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos.

This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic.

Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources-3"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving.

Some even go so far to compare <strong>IGTV to YouTube</strong>, currently, the largest video sharing platform in the world that hosts 300 minutes of video each minute. IGTV may have fewer users than YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to use it effectively for a wide array of different purposes. So, in this article, we are going to take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of each platform in order to help you discover how you can utilize each of these social networks to broaden the audience for the content you share online.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Reels VS Instagram Stories–Everything You Need to Know &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better? &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference"><a href="#IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference"></a>IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference</h2><p>Comparison between IGTV and YouTube is somewhat unfair towards the former since IGTV is a much younger platform that still needs time to develop. YouTube, on the other hand, has a reputation as one of the most reliable video sharing platforms ever created that enables people from all walks of life to upload and share music, movies, gaming videos and virtually any other type of moving images. Even so, let’s take a look at major differences and similarities between IGTV and YouTube.</p><h4 id="Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences"><a href="#Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Have a Quick Glance of the Differences"></a>Have a Quick Glance of the Differences</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Interface Differences</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">The Upload Process</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Discovering New Content</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part4">Monetization</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part5">Analytics and Insights</a></p><h4 id="1-Interface-Differences"><a href="#1-Interface-Differences" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface Differences"></a>1. Interface Differences</h4><p>Despite the fact that you can access IGTV from a web browser, this platform is predominantly dedicated to videos that are going to be watched on mobile devices. This also means that the thumbnails of the videos you uploaded to your IGTV channel are going to be displayed differently than those on your YouTube channel. The interfaces of these two social networks are entirely different, but if you are a newcomer to each of these platforms you won’t have much trouble getting used to them.</p><h4 id="2-The-Upload-Process"><a href="#2-The-Upload-Process" class="headerlink" title="2. The Upload Process"></a>2. The Upload Process</h4><p>The fact that you can only upload vertically oriented videos to IGTV somewhat limits your options because you either have to record a video for IGTV specifically or you must edit a horizontally oriented video and change its aspect ratio to 9:16. You can upload videos to YouTube and IGTV directly from your computer or you can use iPhone and Android-based apps to capture videos with your phone and upload them to either of these platforms. The maximum duration of an IGTV video can’t exceed sixty minutes, while the default duration of all videos on YouTube is set to 15 minutes. Nonetheless, if you own a verified YouTube account, you can upload videos that have 128GB and last up to 12 hours.</p><p>At the moment the videos you want to upload to your IGTV channel have to be saved in the MP4 file format because the platform still doesn’t offer support for any other video file format. YouTube grants much more freedom in this respect as it allows you to upload videos saved in AVI, FLV, MOV, MP4 and other commonly used file formats.</p><h4 id="3-Discovering-New-Content"><a href="#3-Discovering-New-Content" class="headerlink" title="3. Discovering New Content"></a>3. Discovering New Content</h4><p>IGTV is more than a decade younger than YouTube, so you shouldn’t be surprised if you’re having trouble discovering new content. Moreover, IGTV’s search engine is still relatively new and it is much less powerful than the one used by YouTube. This is the reason why the videos you upload to your YouTube channel are going to be much easier to find via a simple Google search than those you shared on IGTV. Besides, YouTube offers much more new content on a daily basis than IGTV, and it is clear that the Instagram’s new brainchild still has ways to go before it reaches the point when it can challenge the largest video sharing platform in the world in terms of diversity of the content that it delivers to its users.</p><h4 id="4-Monetization"><a href="#4-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="4. Monetization"></a>4. Monetization</h4><p>At the moment, views and likes can’t be monetized on IGTV, so most influencers rely on sponsorships from brands. Things may change as the platform grows, but for the time being IGTV doesn’t provide the content creators with any compensation for the work they are putting in. YouTube allows content creators to monetize their videos through Google Adsense for years, and some of its most prominent users like PewDiePie or Logan Paul have earned hundreds of millions of dollars by posting new content on their YouTube channels. Keep in mind that you are going to need at least a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of viewing time before you can enable YouTube’s Monetize feature.</p><h4 id="5-Analytics-and-Insights"><a href="#5-Analytics-and-Insights" class="headerlink" title="5. Analytics and Insights"></a>5. Analytics and Insights</h4><p>Knowing how many people watched the entire video or how many likes and comments certain types of videos get can help you produce content that attracts a larger audience on all social networks. The metrics such as engagement or view-through rates can be essential during online marketing campaigns as they can suggest how many people are watching your videos and for how long. The analytics tools YouTube provides are much more diverse than those offered by IGTV that only lets you see the audience retention graph and the number of views and comments a video currently has. YouTube is an obviously a much better option for anyone who wants to conduct an in-depth analysis of their content’s performance, although the tools on IGTV are still powerful enough to indicate which type of content your audience likes the most.</p><h2 id="Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes"><a href="#Why-Shouldn’t-You-Use-YouTube-and-IGTV-For-the-Same-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?"></a>Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?</h2><p>You shouldn’t assume that you can post the same type of videos on your YouTube and IGTV channels, just because they are both video sharing platforms. The content you create for your IGTV channel needs to be dynamic and entertaining in order to captivate the audience’s attention. Posting tutorials or hour-long gaming videos on IGTV won’t attract as many viewers as on YouTube, which is why businesses who want to use IGTV to promote their products and services need to choose the content carefully. Furthermore, the videos that last between two and five minutes are still by far the most popular on IGTV, so even though technically you can upload a video that lasts one hour to your IGTV channel, the chances are that such long videos won’t get a lot of views.</p><p>IGTV is probably best used as a tool that can help improve the engagement with your followers on Instagram, but if you want to become an established video content creator, then running a YouTube channel is simply a much better option. It still remains to be seen how will IGTV evolve in the years to come, but at the present moment this platform doesn’t really have any chance of challenging YouTube’s position as the world’s leading video sharing platform.</p><p>However, no matter which video platform you choose, you need to ensure the videos you create are of high quality.

IGTV may have fewer users than YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to use it effectively for a wide array of different purposes.

YouTube, on the other hand, has a reputation as one of the most reliable video sharing platforms ever created that enables people from all walks of life to upload and share music, movies, gaming videos and virtually any other type of moving images. Even so, let’s take a look at major differences and similarities between IGTV and YouTube.</p><h4 id="Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences-1"><a href="#Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences-1" class="headerlink" title="Have a Quick Glance of the Differences"></a>Have a Quick Glance of the Differences</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Interface Differences</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">The Upload Process</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Discovering New Content</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part4">Monetization</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part5">Analytics and Insights</a></p><h4 id="1-Interface-Differences-1"><a href="#1-Interface-Differences-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Interface Differences</h4><p>Despite the fact that you can access IGTV from a web browser, this platform is predominantly dedicated to videos that are going to be watched on mobile devices. This also means that the thumbnails of the videos you uploaded to your IGTV channel are going to be displayed differently than those on your YouTube channel. The interfaces of these two social networks are entirely different, but if you are a newcomer to each of these platforms you won’t have much trouble getting used to them.</p><h4 id="2-The-Upload-Process-1"><a href="#2-The-Upload-Process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. The Upload Process"></a>2. The Upload Process</h4><p>The fact that you can only upload vertically oriented videos to IGTV somewhat limits your options because you either have to record a video for IGTV specifically or you must edit a horizontally oriented video and change its aspect ratio to 9:16. You can upload videos to YouTube and IGTV directly from your computer or you can use iPhone and Android-based apps to capture videos with your phone and upload them to either of these platforms. The maximum duration of an IGTV video can’t exceed sixty minutes, while the default duration of all videos on YouTube is set to 15 minutes. Nonetheless, if you own a verified YouTube account, you can upload videos that have 128GB and last up to 12 hours.</p><p>At the moment the videos you want to upload to your IGTV channel have to be saved in the MP4 file format because the platform still doesn’t offer support for any other video file format. YouTube grants much more freedom in this respect as it allows you to upload videos saved in AVI, FLV, MOV, MP4 and other commonly used file formats.</p><h4 id="3-Discovering-New-Content-1"><a href="#3-Discovering-New-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Discovering New Content"></a>3. Discovering New Content</h4><p>IGTV is more than a decade younger than YouTube, so you shouldn’t be surprised if you’re having trouble discovering new content. Moreover, IGTV’s search engine is still relatively new and it is much less powerful than the one used by YouTube. This is the reason why the videos you upload to your YouTube channel are going to be much easier to find via a simple Google search than those you shared on IGTV. Besides, YouTube offers much more new content on a daily basis than IGTV, and it is clear that the Instagram’s new brainchild still has ways to go before it reaches the point when it can challenge the largest video sharing platform in the world in terms of diversity of the content that it delivers to its users.</p><h4 id="4-Monetization-1"><a href="#4-Monetization-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Things may change as the platform grows, but for the time being IGTV doesn’t provide the content creators with any compensation for the work they are putting in. YouTube allows content creators to monetize their videos through Google Adsense for years, and some of its most prominent users like PewDiePie or Logan Paul have earned hundreds of millions of dollars by posting new content on their YouTube channels. Keep in mind that you are going to need at least a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of viewing time before you can enable YouTube’s Monetize feature.</p><h4 id="5-Analytics-and-Insights-1"><a href="#5-Analytics-and-Insights-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

The metrics such as engagement or view-through rates can be essential during online marketing campaigns as they can suggest how many people are watching your videos and for how long. The analytics tools YouTube provides are much more diverse than those offered by IGTV that only lets you see the audience retention graph and the number of views and comments a video currently has.

Some even go so far to compare <strong>IGTV to YouTube</strong>, currently, the largest video sharing platform in the world that hosts 300 minutes of video each minute. IGTV may have fewer users than YouTube, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find a way to use it effectively for a wide array of different purposes. So, in this article, we are going to take a look at the advantages and disadvantages of each platform in order to help you discover how you can utilize each of these social networks to broaden the audience for the content you share online.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Reels VS Instagram Stories–Everything You Need to Know &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Shorts vs. TikTok: Which One Is Better? &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference-3"><a href="#IGTV-VS-YouTube-What’s-the-difference-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference"></a>IGTV VS YouTube: What’s the difference</h2><p>Comparison between IGTV and YouTube is somewhat unfair towards the former since IGTV is a much younger platform that still needs time to develop. YouTube, on the other hand, has a reputation as one of the most reliable video sharing platforms ever created that enables people from all walks of life to upload and share music, movies, gaming videos and virtually any other type of moving images. Even so, let’s take a look at major differences and similarities between IGTV and YouTube.</p><h4 id="Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences-3"><a href="#Have-a-Quick-Glance-of-the-Differences-3" class="headerlink" title="Have a Quick Glance of the Differences"></a>Have a Quick Glance of the Differences</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Interface Differences</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">The Upload Process</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Discovering New Content</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part4">Monetization</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part5">Analytics and Insights</a></p><h4 id="1-Interface-Differences-3"><a href="#1-Interface-Differences-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface Differences"></a>1. Interface Differences</h4><p>Despite the fact that you can access IGTV from a web browser, this platform is predominantly dedicated to videos that are going to be watched on mobile devices. This also means that the thumbnails of the videos you uploaded to your IGTV channel are going to be displayed differently than those on your YouTube channel. The interfaces of these two social networks are entirely different, but if you are a newcomer to each of these platforms you won’t have much trouble getting used to them.</p><h4 id="2-The-Upload-Process-3"><a href="#2-The-Upload-Process-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Upload Process"></a>2. The Upload Process</h4><p>The fact that you can only upload vertically oriented videos to IGTV somewhat limits your options because you either have to record a video for IGTV specifically or you must edit a horizontally oriented video and change its aspect ratio to 9:16. You can upload videos to YouTube and IGTV directly from your computer or you can use iPhone and Android-based apps to capture videos with your phone and upload them to either of these platforms. The maximum duration of an IGTV video can’t exceed sixty minutes, while the default duration of all videos on YouTube is set to 15 minutes. Nonetheless, if you own a verified YouTube account, you can upload videos that have 128GB and last up to 12 hours.</p><p>At the moment the videos you want to upload to your IGTV channel have to be saved in the MP4 file format because the platform still doesn’t offer support for any other video file format. YouTube grants much more freedom in this respect as it allows you to upload videos saved in AVI, FLV, MOV, MP4 and other commonly used file formats.</p><h4 id="3-Discovering-New-Content-3"><a href="#3-Discovering-New-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Discovering New Content"></a>3. Discovering New Content</h4><p>IGTV is more than a decade younger than YouTube, so you shouldn’t be surprised if you’re having trouble discovering new content. Moreover, IGTV’s search engine is still relatively new and it is much less powerful than the one used by YouTube. This is the reason why the videos you upload to your YouTube channel are going to be much easier to find via a simple Google search than those you shared on IGTV. Besides, YouTube offers much more new content on a daily basis than IGTV, and it is clear that the Instagram’s new brainchild still has ways to go before it reaches the point when it can challenge the largest video sharing platform in the world in terms of diversity of the content that it delivers to its users.</p><h4 id="4-Monetization-3"><a href="#4-Monetization-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Monetization"></a>4. Monetization</h4><p>At the moment, views and likes can’t be monetized on IGTV, so most influencers rely on sponsorships from brands. Things may change as the platform grows, but for the time being IGTV doesn’t provide the content creators with any compensation for the work they are putting in. YouTube allows content creators to monetize their videos through Google Adsense for years, and some of its most prominent users like PewDiePie or Logan Paul have earned hundreds of millions of dollars by posting new content on their YouTube channels. Keep in mind that you are going to need at least a thousand subscribers and 4,000 hours of viewing time before you can enable YouTube’s Monetize feature.</p><h4 id="5-Analytics-and-Insights-3"><a href="#5-Analytics-and-Insights-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Analytics and Insights"></a>5. Analytics and Insights</h4><p>Knowing how many people watched the entire video or how many likes and comments certain types of videos get can help you produce content that attracts a larger audience on all social networks. The metrics such as engagement or view-through rates can be essential during online marketing campaigns as they can suggest how many people are watching your videos and for how long. The analytics tools YouTube provides are much more diverse than those offered by IGTV that only lets you see the audience retention graph and the number of views and comments a video currently has. YouTube is an obviously a much better option for anyone who wants to conduct an in-depth analysis of their content’s performance, although the tools on IGTV are still powerful enough to indicate which type of content your audience likes the most.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Why Shouldn’t You Use YouTube and IGTV For the Same Purposes?<p>You shouldn’t assume that you can post the same type of videos on your YouTube and IGTV channels, just because they are both video sharing platforms. The content you create for your IGTV channel needs to be dynamic and entertaining in order to captivate the audience’s attention. Posting tutorials or hour-long gaming videos on IGTV won’t attract as many viewers as on YouTube, which is why businesses who want to use IGTV to promote their products and services need to choose the content carefully. Furthermore, the videos that last between two and five minutes are still by far the most popular on IGTV, so even though technically you can upload a video that lasts one hour to your IGTV channel, the chances are that such long videos won’t get a lot of views.</p><p>IGTV is probably best used as a tool that can help improve the engagement with your followers on Instagram, but if you want to become an established video content creator, then running a YouTube channel is simply a much better option.

Nobody outside of Google knows exactly how the algorithm works, but we do know one of the major factors influencing it is to watch <strong>time</strong>.</p><p>Watch time refers to how a video effects the session time of a viewer. If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn’t closely related to the interests of individual viewers. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to keep you on the site longer. Part of that is recommending things, surely, you’ll be interested in, and part of that is trying to get you interested in things that’ll keep you around.</p><p>  A video that is simply watched for longer, because it is engaging and can hold viewers’ attention for a long time, will have a high watch time. So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.</p><p>The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.</p><p> Are you usually happy with YouTube’s recommended videos?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used"><a href="#What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used" class="headerlink" title="What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?"></a>What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>YouTube is forever recommending videos for you whether it’s in your dashboard or next to the video you’re already watching.

If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn’t closely related to the interests of individual viewers.

So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.</p><p>The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.</p><p> Are you usually happy with YouTube’s recommended videos?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1611407/17882" target="_top" id="1611407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1611407"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="485"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1611407/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used-2"><a href="#What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used-2" class="headerlink" title="What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?"></a>What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-3"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-3" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>YouTube is forever recommending videos for you whether it’s in your dashboard or next to the video you’re already watching.

However, these options may not be available to you depending on where you’re based. AdSense does make payments through electronic wire transfer (EFT – Electronic funds transfer) to virtually every country in the world, and this is the preferred payment option for most people.</p><p>To have your earnings deposited directly into your account through EFT, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide for linking your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><ol><li>Log in to AdSense via: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/adsense/start" >www.google.com/adsense/start <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Click the ‘Settings’ button in the left panel menu</li><li>Under ‘Settings’, click ‘Payments’.</li><li>On the ‘Payments’ page, click ‘Manage payment options’.</li><li>Click ‘Add payment method’.</li><li>Next, you’ll be prompted to add your bank account details.

To edit your AdSense name, click the ‘Manage settings’ button also on the Payments page.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-Receiving-Payments"><a href="#Part-4-Receiving-Payments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Receiving Payments"></a>Part 4: Receiving Payments</h2><p>To get paid by AdSense, you need to reach the $100 threshold. You may wish to set a higher threshold but as a rule, earnings below the $100 will not be processed for payment (you will still receive the money, it will just keep adding up until it gets to $100 and then you’ll be paid).</p><p>Also, bear in mind that AdSense follows a monthly payment cycle. This means that a month’s earnings (assuming they meet the threshold requirement) will be paid next month. Usually, direct deposit payments will be processed between the 21st and 26th of every month. That said, it can take up to 10 days for electronic wire payments to be received.</p><p>In addition to reaching the payment threshold, be sure that you have no payment hold on your AdSense account. A payment hold can cause your earnings to be withheld even if it has reached the payment threshold.</p><p>To avoid a payment hold, be sure to provide the necessary tax information, verify your identity and your address, make sure the bank account linked to your AdSense is verified, and make sure you have not violated any of YouTube’s guidelines and community rules.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Depending on your vlogging skills and the nature of your content (some types of videos get more attention than others), it can take a while for you to be eligible for monetization. And even when you’ve successfully monetized your channel, getting enough views to reach the payment threshold can be tough.</p><p>Don’t let this discourage you from working towards earning income from your YouTube channel. Just focus on creating a YouTube channel people will want to watch. That’s how to get paid on YouTube - be sticking with your channel long enough for it to grow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-5"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-5" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>YouTube is more than a video sharing social network; here’s how to get paid on YouTube.

So, posting videos which do not belong to you or which include copyrighted content can cause your monetization application to be declined.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Linking-Your-Bank-Account-To-Your-AdSense-Account-3"><a href="#Part-3-Linking-Your-Bank-Account-To-Your-AdSense-Account-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Linking Your Bank Account To Your AdSense Account"></a>Part 3: Linking Your Bank Account To Your AdSense Account</h2><p>AdSense offers a variety of payment options including mailed checks and Western Union transfers. However, these options may not be available to you depending on where you’re based. AdSense does make payments through electronic wire transfer (EFT – Electronic funds transfer) to virtually every country in the world, and this is the preferred payment option for most people.</p><p>To have your earnings deposited directly into your account through EFT, you’ll need to link your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><p>Here’s a step-by-step guide for linking your bank account to your AdSense account.</p><ol><li>Log in to AdSense via: <a class="link"   href="http://www.google.com/adsense/start" >www.google.com/adsense/start <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Click the ‘Settings’ button in the left panel menu</li><li>Under ‘Settings’, click ‘Payments’.</li><li>On the ‘Payments’ page, click ‘Manage payment options’.</li><li>Click ‘Add payment method’.</li><li>Next, you’ll be prompted to add your bank account details. In general, you will be asked to provide the following:  <ol><li><em>Name on the account &#x2F; account holder’s name</em>  </li><li><em>Bank account number</em>  </li><li><em>Bank name</em>  </li><li><em>Bank SWIFT code</em>  </li><li><em>Depending on where you are based, additional information may be required.</em></li></ol></li><li>Ensure that the name on your AdSense account matches the name on the bank account you provide. To edit your AdSense name, click the ‘Manage settings’ button also on the Payments page.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Receiving-Payments-3"><a href="#Part-4-Receiving-Payments-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Receiving Payments"></a>Part 4: Receiving Payments</h2><p>To get paid by AdSense, you need to reach the $100 threshold. You may wish to set a higher threshold but as a rule, earnings below the $100 will not be processed for payment (you will still receive the money, it will just keep adding up until it gets to $100 and then you’ll be paid).</p><p>Also, bear in mind that AdSense follows a monthly payment cycle. This means that a month’s earnings (assuming they meet the threshold requirement) will be paid next month. Usually, direct deposit payments will be processed between the 21st and 26th of every month. That said, it can take up to 10 days for electronic wire payments to be received.</p><p>In addition to reaching the payment threshold, be sure that you have no payment hold on your AdSense account. A payment hold can cause your earnings to be withheld even if it has reached the payment threshold.</p><p>To avoid a payment hold, be sure to provide the necessary tax information, verify your identity and your address, make sure the bank account linked to your AdSense is verified, and make sure you have not violated any of YouTube’s guidelines and community rules.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Depending on your vlogging skills and the nature of your content (some types of videos get more attention than others), it can take a while for you to be eligible for monetization. And even when you’ve successfully monetized your channel, getting enough views to reach the payment threshold can be tough.</p><p>Don’t let this discourage you from working towards earning income from your YouTube channel. Just focus on creating a YouTube channel people will want to watch. That’s how to get paid on YouTube - be sticking with your channel long enough for it to grow.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-4-effective-methods-for-slide-embedding-from-youtube/"><u>[New] 4 Effective Methods for Slide Embedding From YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-adopting-nature-positive-policies-in-urban-governance/"><u>[New] Adopting Nature-Positive Policies in Urban Governance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-bulk-buy-subscribers-cost-effective-growth-strategy/"><u>[New] Bulk Buy Subscribers  Cost-Effective Growth Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-comic-capers-top-10-hilarious-youtube-short-film-ideas/"><u>[New] Comic Capers  Top 10 Hilarious YouTube Short Film Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-core-auditory-stimulation-channels/"><u>[New] Core Auditory Stimulation Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-crafting-an-engaging-online-presence-the-complete-guide-to-youtube-submissions/"><u>[New] Crafting an Engaging Online Presence  The Complete Guide to YouTube Submissions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-deciphering-youtubes-featured-comment-selection/"><u>[New] Deciphering YouTube's Featured Comment Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-dissecting-video-platform-distinctions-youtube-vs-dailymention/"><u>[New] Dissecting Video Platform Distinctions  YouTube Vs.

They have two alternatives for customers who want to use their apps: either pay for such a lifetime purchase of the app or enjoy the free version that includes ADS. Best ad blocker for android helps eliminate ADS from apps installed on our Android devices.</p><p>Many people choose to use the free version since they can’t afford to pay for a standard app, while some opt for Mods, but the best method to avoid ADS is to use programs that block them entirely. Although most of the best ad blockers for android applications listed below work on browsers, you may need to root your Android smartphone to utilize some of them.</p><p>Let’s get started with this article’s list of the best ad blocker for android applications, which will help you get rid of the annoying ads you encounter in apps regularly.</p><p>Free ad blocker for android apps</p><p>To find the best free ad blocker for android apps, you’re probably searching for an app that can block ads in the browser rather than system-wide ad blocking (as explained above). If you’re looking for ad-blocking software for your Android phone, there are a plethora of free, high-quality options.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-AdAway"><a href="#1-AdAway" class="headerlink" title="1.AdAway"></a>1.AdAway</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adaway-for-android-poster.png"                      alt="adaway-for-android-poster"                ></p><p>AdWay is the best free ad blocker for android apps.

As subscribers to the YouTube channel increase, the creator can apply for YouTube’s Partner Program and start monetizing the channel with channel membership or subscriptions.</p><p>That’s not all; the creator can also use different ads, and the revenue generated can even be in millions if you have a lot of subscribers.</p><p>Then comes the channel type. If the channel is a niche, it will not make as much money as channels that meet the public’s appetite.</p><p>Lastly, we can’t ignore the quality of videos, can we?</p><p>A high-quality video with multiple transitions, effects, and interactive scenes is a must if you want to gain popularity on your YouTube channel.</p><p>So how can we make our videos top-notch?</p><p>Read on and find the answer in the bonus tip below.</p><h3 id="Bonus-Tip-to-Increase-YouTube-Money-1"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-to-Increase-YouTube-Money-1" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip to Increase YouTube Money"></a>Bonus Tip to Increase YouTube Money</h3><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a></p><p>One of the best video editor platforms for pushing the storytelling boundaries of your YouTube videos is Wondershare Filmora.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/highest-paid-youtuber-in-the-world-2022-11.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>This powerful and intuitive video editor is suited for all kinds of content creators, especially YouTubers.

TikTokers are also earning a fortune nowadays. But which one of them is better? Let’s have a look at it.</p><p><strong>Are YouTubers Earning More Money than TikTokers?</strong></p><p>With analysis, it’s crystal clear that YouTubers are making more money than TickTokers, and it’s not without reason.</p><p>In the year 2021, YouTube has paid more than 15 Billion US$ to its creators altogether, according to <a class="link"   href="https://www.jumpstartmag.com/youtube-vs-tiktok-which-platform-pays-its-creators-better/" >JUMPSTART <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. And it’s to be expected because Youtubers have been making content for way longer than TickTokers.</p><p>For example, MrBeast posted his first video on YouTube in 2012, and it has been about 10 years since he created his content.</p><p><strong>Are Highest-Paid YouTube Stars Always Trending?</strong></p><p>Since the highest-paid YouTubers make so much money, you may think they are always “Trending” on YouTube.</p><p>Sorry to pop your bubble, but they are not.</p><p>The highest-paid YouTubers may have a ton of subscribers, but being in “Trending” is different.</p><p>The most important reason is that the “Trending” part of YouTube shows popular videos in the specific area of the users, so it varies depending upon the user’s location.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1"

All you need is an alien green screen effect – an animated alien against a green background. In Filmora, you drag that alien effect into your PIP track and switch the green background to transparent.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Your alien buddy will be overlaid over your main clip, which will make it look like he is there with you.

If a YouTuber with a similar topic to yours approaches you with a Sub4Sub request and you engage them in a conversation it could be the beginning of a great friendship. Beyond subscribing to each other you can share tips, comment on each other’s videos, and maybe even collaborate on a video someday.</p><p> Sub4Sub can also help some YouTubers with their confidence. It can be discouraging not to see any growth and being embarrassed over their low subscriber counts can result in vloggers deciding to hide that information. They may feel like their content is being judged badly by people who are not even watching their videos based on how few subscribers they have. Building up a higher number using Sub4Sub may allow some YouTubers to move past these concerns and get back to focusing on making good videos.</p><h4 id="3-Cons-of-Sub4Sub-3"><a href="#3-Cons-of-Sub4Sub-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Cons of Sub4Sub"></a>3. Cons of Sub4Sub</h4><p> The reality is that if people are pre-judging your videos based on your stats it is not subscribers they are looking at so much as views. Sub4Sub helps you get subscribers, but in most cases those subscribers will never watch any of your videos. They will also never share them or tell their friends to watch them, the way subscribers gained organically will. So while your subscriber count goes up, your view count stays low.</p><p> The situation described in the Pros section, where you talk to each other and comment on each other’s videos, is rare. You are more likely to make friends with other YouTubers after you have already watched each other’s videos or after chatting in a forum. It is worth trying to engage a vlogger with a similar topic to yours if they ask you to sub for sub, but most people who ask will have no intention of interacting with you beyond subscribing to each other. Realistically if you are going to use sub for sub to increase your subscriber count by any significant number you will not have time to have actual conversations with everyone you approach, or to watch their videos.</p><p> When you agree to exchange subscriptions with somebody there is also the danger that they will decide to unsubscribe from your channel afterwards. This could happen much later when they realize they do not want to be subscribed to so many people and have forgotten which channels were parts of Sub4Sub agreements. Or it could happen within weeks, days, or even hours of you subscribing to them. There are some dishonest YouTubers who use sub for sub to get subscribers while already planning to unsubscribe to anybody who agrees. Their hope is that the other person will not notice or will not bother unsubscribing from them if they do.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.</p><p>Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>Smartphone cameras, especially the newest models, are capable of recording great videos.

It gives you exactly the same kind of control over your smartphone camera as you would have over a DSLR. You can manually adjust your focus, exposure, ISO, shutter speed, tint, and color temperature. There are even voice processing audio filters, so you can capture better audio while you’re shooting and have less to fix in post.</p><h3 id="Final-Words-3"><a href="#Final-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>Because mobile cameras already perform so well, it can be easy to think to have more to adjust would only make things more complicated. However, there are occasions where you need to be able to make these adjustments. Are the videos you take inside at night at a lower quality than the ones you record during the day, for example? If you could set a higher ISO, you would be able to fix that.</p><p>Another example: just the other day, there was a question here about shooting green screen videos on a mobile device. One of our community members, Vivekpanwar, was having an issue with motion blur. Motion blur isn’t always distracting in normal videos, but it becomes a huge issue when you apply a Chroma key effect. The best way to avoid motion blur is to set a high shutter speed, which you can do if you download a quality <strong>camera app</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048963/16384" target="_top" id="2048963"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048963"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048963/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="YouTube-Masterclass-Carving-Out-Your-Digital-Self"><a href="#YouTube-Masterclass-Carving-Out-Your-Digital-Self" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Masterclass: Carving Out Your Digital Self"></a>YouTube Masterclass: Carving Out Your Digital Self</h2><h1 id="How-to-Build-Your-Personal-Brand-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Build-Your-Personal-Brand-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Build Your Personal Brand on YouTube"></a>How to Build Your Personal Brand on YouTube</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                                     ></p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>How can you build a personal brand on YouTube that stands out?</p><p>YouTube is oversaturated.

You wouldn’t stop at saying ‘it’s a comedy’ or ‘it’s about lawyers’ – that doesn’t really tell them anything. You would describe the style of comedy, the personalities of characters you love, and the kinds of plots the show offers.</p><p>You need to be able to do that when you talk about your channel.</p><blockquote><p>What is your style of comedy?</p><p>What is your attitude towards fashion?</p><p>What will a viewer get out of watching you make pasta that they won’t get from watching someone else make pasta?</p></blockquote><p>Work on developing an elevator pitch for your channel. It will help you define your brand for yourself, and it’ll be useful if you make a channel trailer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Start-Building-Your-Brand-3"><a href="#How-to-Start-Building-Your-Brand-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Start Building Your Brand"></a>How to Start Building Your Brand</h2><p>Building a brand should be intentional. You need to be yourself, but it’s not enough to just ‘be’. You need to create yourself.</p><p>  In order to figure out what unique value you’re bringing to YouTube you’ll need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/understanding-youtube-analytics-%E2%80%93-take-charge-of-your-channel%21-286.html" >pay attention to your channel stats <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and comments your viewers make. It can also be a good idea to ask for feedback from friends who you know will be honest with you.</p><p>You will notice patterns. There will be things you do in your video that people consistently like more and less. The way you build your brand is by cutting out the stuff that isn’t working and focusing more intentionally on the stuff that is. If people like it when you do meme humor, for example, do more meme humor and make incorporating that in your videos part of your brand.</p><p>Banners and thumbnails are also a part of your brand. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-youtube-banners-and-thumbnails-316.html" >More on that here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Being-Consistent-3"><a href="#Being-Consistent-3" class="headerlink" title="Being Consistent"></a>Being Consistent</h2><p>The key to branding is consistency. People need to be able to set expectations.</p><p>For every video you do, ask yourself these questions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Who are you?</em></p><p><em>What is your message?</em></p><p><em>What value are you providing?</em></p><p><em>Who is it for?</em></p></blockquote><p>The answers to these questions make up your brand. They may change gradually over time – i.e. if you start making videos as a 16 year old, for other 16 year olds, then the ‘Who is it for?’ will change as you and your subscriber base get older – but in general the answers should always be the same. If your ‘message’ is positive and empowering, then it should always be positive and empowering.</p><p>When you intentionally create your personal brand on YouTube, you take charge of the message you’re sending.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img                       lazyload

So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.</p><p>There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-Designed Visuals:</strong> These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.</li><li><strong>Customizable Elements:</strong> You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event’s theme.</li><li><strong>Format and Compatibility:</strong> They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082535/7443" target="_top" id="2082535"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082535"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082535/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters"><a href="#Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?"></a>Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?</h2><p>Every DJ out there has their own unique style.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations"><a href="#Technical-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4559731&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.neowise.com/images/nd-ss-w200.jpg"                      border="0"                >NeoDownloader - Fast and fully automatic image&#x2F;video&#x2F;music downloader. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Technical-Considerations-1"><a href="#Technical-Considerations-1" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility-1"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback-1"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync-1"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4694919&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

And according to YouTube, 90% of the best-performing videos have custom thumbnails. Therefore, adding thumbnails to all your videos is wise. But how to do that with live streams? Is it any different from adding thumbnails to normal videos? You’ll find answers in this article. Here’s a comprehensive guide about <strong>YouTube Live thumbnails.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-live-thumbnail.gif"                      alt="guide to youtube live thumbnail"                ></p><h2 id="Overview-of-YouTube-Live"><a href="#Overview-of-YouTube-Live" class="headerlink" title="Overview of YouTube Live"></a>Overview of YouTube Live</h2><p>Livestreaming is very popular now. The pandemic has accelerated its growth. But what made it so special? Watching live streams is different from watching regular videos. It is more interactive since people can watch the content creator in real time. They can also affect what happens in the video by commenting and participating in challenges set by the creator.</p><p>That said, live streaming helps build a better connection between content creators and their audiences. So you may want to incorporate live streaming into your strategies. You can do that on YouTube through YouTube Live. You can use this feature to host virtual events, do live Q&amp;A, play games with your viewers, and more.</p><h2 id="Importance-of-Thumbnail-for-Live-Stream"><a href="#Importance-of-Thumbnail-for-Live-Stream" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Thumbnail for Live Stream"></a>Importance of Thumbnail for Live Stream</h2><p>Thumbnails are important for videos. Alongside the title, they inform the viewers what the video is about. It’s not different with live streams. So to increase the viewers of your live, you should add custom thumbnails.</p><p>What happens if you don’t add a custom thumbnail to your live stream? YouTube will select a random frame from the video and display it. The thing is that live streams are usually longer than recorded videos. So YouTube has more options to use as the thumbnail.</p><p>The problem is that most of those frames are not suitable to be used as the video cover. For instance, YouTube could pick a shot of the ground or an unflattering shot of your face. So, it’s a must to add a custom thumbnail for your live stream.</p><h2 id="How-To-Add-a-YouTube-Live-Thumbnail"><a href="#How-To-Add-a-YouTube-Live-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="How To Add a YouTube Live Thumbnail"></a>How To Add a YouTube Live Thumbnail</h2><p>Now, you know how important adding custom thumbnails to live streams is.

What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.</p><p>Choosing the background image from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora’s native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube’s suggested thumbnail size.</p><p>It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don’t have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.</p><p>Filmora’s tools for editing the video thumbnail aren’t too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more. You can use Wondershare Filmora’s AI Portrait feature to easily change it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901410&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Pro - Software based live production. vMix Pro includes everything in vMix 4K plus 8 channels of Replay and 8 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-Filmora’s-AI-Portrait-Feature-1"><a href="#What-is-Filmora’s-AI-Portrait-Feature-1" class="headerlink" title="What is Filmora’s AI Portrait Feature?"></a>What is Filmora’s AI Portrait Feature?</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora’s AI Portrait feature allows you to quickly remove and change the background of an image.</p><p>Normally, you would need a green screen or chroma key to do that.

The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora’s native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube’s suggested thumbnail size.</p><p>It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don’t have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.</p><p>Filmora’s tools for editing the video thumbnail aren’t too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more.

What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.</p><p>Choosing the background image from <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora’s native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube’s suggested thumbnail size.</p><p>It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don’t have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.</p><p>Filmora’s tools for editing the video thumbnail aren’t too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more.

It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably.

This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-DELL-XPS-15"><a href="#2-DELL-XPS-15" class="headerlink" title="2.

At a resolution of 3240 x 2160px, its screen is nearly 4k and can handle Full HD and HD footage with ease. Add to this its capacity to show a considerable portion of the sRGB gamut and its easy-to-use stylus and you can see why this 2-in-1 combo from Microsoft is one of the top 3 laptops for video editing in 2018.</p><p>Surface Book 2 also has the right combination of power and storage capacity that video editing requires. It boasts a state-of-the-art NVIDIA graphics processor and an Intel i7 processor for a smooth workflow no matter the size or level of detail involved in your video editing project.</p><p>On the downside, this laptop is undoubtedly very expensive. Compared to the function and power you can get from the DELL XPS 15, it’s hard to justify paying nearly $2500 for the Surface Book 2. Its detachable screen, supported by a fulcrum hinge, also comes at a price. It makes the laptop a bit bulky at one end when it’s folded. This in turn can make day-to-day handling a bit more tricky than it has to be.</p><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If you’re searching for a good laptop to help you improve the quality of your videos in 2018, look no further than these 3. They have all the power, function, and storage capacity you need to handle any project with ease. Just be mindful of your budget and consider which extras are worth the expense. Go for the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar if customizing your workflow is a priority. Opt for the Dell XPS 15 if you want the best combination of display quality and graphics processing. Finally, consider the Surface Book 2 if you need the flexibility of a 2-in-1 device.</p><p> What do you think is the best laptop for video editing?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Equip-Your-Laptop-with-the-Best-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#Equip-Your-Laptop-with-the-Best-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Equip Your Laptop with the Best Video Editing Software"></a>Equip Your Laptop with the Best Video Editing Software</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions</p><p><a href="#commentsBoxSeoTemplate">0</a></p><p>This article lists the 3 <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best laptops for video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2018.</p><p>Whether you’re an industry professional or an avid YouTuber, you know how important it is to produce quality videos consistently.</p><p>The quality of the videos you create will depend on your creativity, the editing software you use, and the hardware that software is installed on.

It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably. The Touch Bar is set-up to show different shortcuts for different apps. It works quite well with Photoshop and will show thumbnails, filter options, a color picker, and more while you’re editing videos or stills.</p><p>Working with large 4K video files is much easier with the MacBook Pro. It’s fitted with Thunderbolt 3 Ports which have the highest data and video bandwidth available for USB-C connections. With these Thunderbolt ports, you can also use high-speed and high-power peripherals without a hitch. This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.</p><h3 id="2-DELL-XPS-15-2"><a href="#2-DELL-XPS-15-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

It has a wide 15.4” screen with thin bezels, and its proprietary OLED Touch bar amps up its flexibility and functionality considerably. The Touch Bar is set-up to show different shortcuts for different apps. It works quite well with Photoshop and will show thumbnails, filter options, a color picker, and more while you’re editing videos or stills.</p><p>Working with large 4K video files is much easier with the MacBook Pro. It’s fitted with Thunderbolt 3 Ports which have the highest data and video bandwidth available for USB-C connections. With these Thunderbolt ports, you can also use high-speed and high-power peripherals without a hitch. This laptop also has an extra-wide touchpad or Trackpad (as Apple calls it) which expands your physical working surface while also making it easier to do detailed video editing.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you need a variety of ports like most videographers, working with the MacBook Pro could be a challenge as it only has Thunderbolt 3 ports. If this is the laptop you prefer, you’ll need to buy additional connection hardware to work with different input devices. And while this laptop impresses in many ways, it’s also quite expensive. There are certainly other laptops on the market which can give you similar performance at a lower cost.</p><h3 id="2-DELL-XPS-15-3"><a href="#2-DELL-XPS-15-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

It’s considered the closest competitor to the MacBook Pro reviewed above. In fact, many would argue that it tops the MacBook Pro when it comes to speed, color accuracy, and color depth. Its 15.6” screen has very thin bezels for minimal distraction and immersive work experience. At 4K resolution and displaying a wide range of the sRGB gamut, video editing with the Dell XPS 15 promises to be both smooth and enjoyable.</p><p>The Dell XPS 15 is certainly more affordable, while still delivering excellent graphics performance. It features an Intel i7 processor and the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 graphics processor. This makes it remarkably fast for video editing, as well as energy-efficient. People who work with different input devices will also like that this laptop has legacy adapters (USB, HDMI, ethernet) alongside a USB type C port.</p><p>The biggest downside to the Dell XPS 15 laptop is its oddly positioned webcam. It feels awkward and can be an inconvenience to use since you’ll have to adjust your position significantly while making video calls or recording for your YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2-3"><a href="#3-MICROSOFT-SURFACE-BOOK-2-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

At a resolution of 3240 x 2160px, its screen is nearly 4k and can handle Full HD and HD footage with ease. Add to this its capacity to show a considerable portion of the sRGB gamut and its easy-to-use stylus and you can see why this 2-in-1 combo from Microsoft is one of the top 3 laptops for video editing in 2018.</p><p>Surface Book 2 also has the right combination of power and storage capacity that video editing requires. It boasts a state-of-the-art NVIDIA graphics processor and an Intel i7 processor for a smooth workflow no matter the size or level of detail involved in your video editing project.</p><p>On the downside, this laptop is undoubtedly very expensive. Compared to the function and power you can get from the DELL XPS 15, it’s hard to justify paying nearly $2500 for the Surface Book 2. Its detachable screen, supported by a fulcrum hinge, also comes at a price. It makes the laptop a bit bulky at one end when it’s folded. This in turn can make day-to-day handling a bit more tricky than it has to be.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="CONCLUSION-3"><a href="#CONCLUSION-3" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p>If you’re searching for a good laptop to help you improve the quality of your videos in 2018, look no further than these 3.

Everyone can create a YouTube account, but YPP requires certain requirements. Every time you create content, you must consider these requirements.</p><p>Prior to applying for the program, your channel must first accomplish the following:</p><ul><li>One thousand subscribers</li><li>A total of 4,000 watch hours in the past year</li></ul><p>Building your audience and creating great content will help you meet these requirements. Joining the YPP, and making sure your YouTube channel complies with YouTube’s rules and policies, is the more complicated aspect.</p><p>Those advertising on YouTube want to avoid being linked to low-quality content. Therefore, YouTube Partner Program members are encouraged to create unique, valuable videos.</p><p>When you upload content to YouTube, you’ll need to keep these things in mind. Those who plan on monetizing their videos should thoroughly read these documents. You also need to set up a Google AdSense account, which tracks and pays for your YouTube ads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/2023-YouTube-Monetization-Mastery-How-to-Monetize-YouTube-Videos-2.JPG"                      alt="rules and requirements for monetization"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-10-Proven-Ways-to-Monetize-Your-YouTube-Channel-1"><a href="#Part-2-10-Proven-Ways-to-Monetize-Your-YouTube-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 10 Proven Ways to Monetize Your YouTube Channel"></a>Part 2. 10 Proven Ways to Monetize Your YouTube Channel</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Methods-to-Monetize-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#10-Methods-to-Monetize-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="10 Methods to Monetize YouTube Videos"></a>10 Methods to Monetize YouTube Videos</h3><p>You can monetize your YouTube videos in 10 different ways, including:</p><ul><li><a href="#filmora1">Google Adsense</a></li><li><a href="#filmora2">Paid Sponsorship</a></li><li><a href="#filmora3">YouTube Premium</a></li><li><a href="#filmora4">Memberships</a></li><li><a href="#filmora5">Merchandise</a></li><li><a href="#filmora6">Invest in crowd-funding</a></li><li><a href="#filmora7">Stickers, chats, and thanks</a></li><li><a href="#filmora8">YouTube Shorts</a></li><li><a href="#filmora9">YouTube Brandconnect</a></li><li><a href="#filmora10">YouTube Shopping</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Google-AdSense-1"><a href="#1-Google-AdSense-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

The attention span of an average person who watches videos online is rather limited, which means that you, as a YouTube video creator, have only a small window of opportunity to captivate their attention. A 3D intro can be just the thing you need to set the tone for an entire video, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best intro makers you can use on your PC or Mac computers, online or on your Smartphones.</p><h2 id="The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#The-5-Best-3D-Intro-Makers-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos"></a>The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/learn-gaming-video-editing-skills-banner.png" >Wondershare Filmstock Gaming Video Editing Skils <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source_channel=seo_article&spm=rs.filmora_web" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle&amp;spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h4 id="1-Panzoid"><a href="#1-Panzoid" class="headerlink" title="1.

Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.</p><h4 id="2-Blender"><a href="#2-Blender" class="headerlink" title="2. Blender"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.blender.org/" >Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Linux, Windows, macOS</p><p>Creating visual effects, tracking objects or making 3D intros for your YouTube videos are just a few, among numerous things you can do with Blender. This is an open source software, which means that anyone who is skillful enough can become a contributor. Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.</p><h4 id="3-Renderforest"><a href="#3-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="3. Renderforest"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.renderforest.com/" >Renderforest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,99 for a single export</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>You can use Renderforest for much more than just making intros, as the platform offers the tools for logo creation, video editing, and website design. The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.</p><h4 id="4-MotionDen"><a href="#4-MotionDen" class="headerlink" title="4. MotionDen"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://motionden.com/" >MotionDen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, subscription plans start at $9,00</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> web-based</p><p>Making 2D animations, birthday videos, commercials, logo animations or 3D intros for YouTube videos on the MotionDen platform is easy. There are hundreds of templates organized in categories and you just have to go to YouTube Intros category and select the intro you’d like to add to your YouTube video. You must create an account on the MotionDen platform, if you want to customize your videos before you download them. Keep in mind that you can only edit and download one intro for free and that you must choose a subscription plan in order to be able to fully customize the 3D YouTube intro you’ve selected and download it to your computer without a watermark. MotionDen is a great source of material for all YouTube content creators who don’t want to spend a lot of time creating 3D intros from scratch and would rather quickly customize a template before adding it to their project.</p><h4 id="5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube"><a href="#5-Intro-Maker-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="5.

The app’s text editing capabilities are remarkable since you can animate the text with twenty different animations, change a font or control the shadows.

One of the best is the Elgato Game Capture HD60 featured above. It captures video directly onto either your Mac or PC, while a lot of the other top capture devices only work with a PC. It can record in 1080p with 60fps, and you can even live stream. The Elgato HD60 is compatible with PS4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and the Wii U.</p><h4 id="2-Audio-Recording-Devices"><a href="#2-Audio-Recording-Devices" class="headerlink" title="2.

The thing that will set you apart from other people posting gaming commentary is your personality, and that will only come across if your videos have clear audio. It does not do you much good to be hilarious in a fuzzy commentary track.</p><p>A lot of YouTube gamers, especially gamers who are just starting to make videos, go with the Zalman ZM-Mic1 which can be used in combination with headphones. The Zalman might pick up background sounds, like mouse clicks, which is not ideal. However, it will give you significantly better audio than recording directly from your computer, and at under $10 it will not be a purchase you regret. The Zalman is a great starter-mic, especially if you download the free audio editing program Audacity and use it to clean up the little imperfections in your recording. Audacity can be downloaded at Audacityteam.org.</p><p>If you are looking for more control over your recording then you should consider the Blue Yeti Mic, which is featured above. This standalone mic is also used by a lot of vloggers and YouTube gamers. It has volume control and even a mute button. It plugs right into the USB drive of your computer using a ten-foot cable, which means you can take it pretty far from your computer. The Blue Yeti USB mic costs about $130.</p><p>Check our best list of audio recording devices: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Microphones for YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Video-Recording-Devices"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-Devices" class="headerlink" title="3.

Rather than buying a $1000 DSLR for reaction shots, you should go with a reliable webcam. Before you make a decision about what kind of webcam to get consider how often you will be using your facecam. Not all gaming videos need one. If you play a lot of survival horror games then your reactions will be a key element in your videos, but if you are not playing games that will cause you to have amusing reactions then a facecam will not really add anything to a viewer’s experience.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to use DSLR as a webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If your facecam is going to be an important element in your channel then you should expect to spend around $100 on your webcam. The above image is the Logitech C920, which is one of the best at this price point. It performs well in low light, has a good auto-focus feature, and the quality of its video recordings is quite high.</p><p>If you are only going to use a facecam occasionally then consider the Genius WideCam F100, which can be found online for around $30. Its 1080p HD recordings are not as smooth as they should be, but it performs very well at 720p and that is all you should need.</p><p>Check more options for the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best webcams for YouTuber <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Once you have these gaming recording devices, you can now go to record a gameplay and upload it to YouTube.

The worst thing you can do is try to point a camera at the screen of your computer or television; recording your screen directly is a must. What kind of game capture gear you need will depend on what kind of game you are playing.</p><p>For recording games on your computer screen, you may only need software, and there are a few quality game recording software out there for free. One popular option among YouTube gamers is called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or ‘Open Broadcaster Software’. OBS is free to download from Obsproject.com. The thing that makes it great for gamers is it can be used for live streaming to YouTube, or other sharing sites like Twitch.tv (which has a focus on gaming videos).</p><p>For those who want to record the gameplay with ease and edit the recorded gameplay footage with the same tool, we recommend you to try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which is a 2-in-1 gameplay recording software and video editor on both Windows and Mac.</p><p>The advantages of using Filmora to record YouTube Gameplay video:</p><ul><li>Record 4K gameplay and high-space game</li><li>Record gameplay and webcam at the same time</li><li>Mark the important moment with the Marker feature when playing the game</li><li>Basic video editing tools provide trimming, cutting, and merging features as well as annotation effects</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>If you are going to be making videos more related to consol games then you may need to invest in a Capture device.

It can record in 1080p with 60fps, and you can even live stream.

The thing that will set you apart from other people posting gaming commentary is your personality, and that will only come across if your videos have clear audio. It does not do you much good to be hilarious in a fuzzy commentary track.</p><p>A lot of YouTube gamers, especially gamers who are just starting to make videos, go with the Zalman ZM-Mic1 which can be used in combination with headphones. The Zalman might pick up background sounds, like mouse clicks, which is not ideal. However, it will give you significantly better audio than recording directly from your computer, and at under $10 it will not be a purchase you regret. The Zalman is a great starter-mic, especially if you download the free audio editing program Audacity and use it to clean up the little imperfections in your recording. Audacity can be downloaded at Audacityteam.org.</p><p>If you are looking for more control over your recording then you should consider the Blue Yeti Mic, which is featured above. This standalone mic is also used by a lot of vloggers and YouTube gamers. It has volume control and even a mute button. It plugs right into the USB drive of your computer using a ten-foot cable, which means you can take it pretty far from your computer. The Blue Yeti USB mic costs about $130.</p><p>Check our best list of audio recording devices: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Microphones for YouTubers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Video-Recording-Devices-3"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-Devices-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Rather than buying a $1000 DSLR for reaction shots, you should go with a reliable webcam. Before you make a decision about what kind of webcam to get consider how often you will be using your facecam. Not all gaming videos need one. If you play a lot of survival horror games then your reactions will be a key element in your videos, but if you are not playing games that will cause you to have amusing reactions then a facecam will not really add anything to a viewer’s experience.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to use DSLR as a webcam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If your facecam is going to be an important element in your channel then you should expect to spend around $100 on your webcam.

This is because they doubt whether subscribers gained this way actually help them get more views on their videos.</p><p> This article will explain the pros and cons of Sub4Sub.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Does-YouTube-Sub4Sub-Work-2"><a href="#Does-YouTube-Sub4Sub-Work-2" class="headerlink" title="Does YouTube Sub4Sub Work"></a>Does YouTube Sub4Sub Work</h2><h4 id="1-Does-Sub4Sub-Work-2"><a href="#1-Does-Sub4Sub-Work-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Does Sub4Sub Work?"></a>1. Does Sub4Sub Work?</h4><p> The technical answer is ‘yes’. You can get new subscribers quickly using sub for sub and it is in no way against YouTube’s rules. On the other hand, subscribers gained through sub for sub do not watch or share your videos. Users end up with more subscribers, but their channels do not truly grow.</p><h4 id="2-Pros-of-Sub4Sub-2"><a href="#2-Pros-of-Sub4Sub-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Pros of Sub4Sub"></a>2. Pros of Sub4Sub</h4><p> A big part of doing well on YouTube is being engaged in your vlogging community. If a YouTuber with a similar topic to yours approaches you with a Sub4Sub request and you engage them in a conversation it could be the beginning of a great friendship. Beyond subscribing to each other you can share tips, comment on each other’s videos, and maybe even collaborate on a video someday.</p><p> Sub4Sub can also help some YouTubers with their confidence. It can be discouraging not to see any growth and being embarrassed over their low subscriber counts can result in vloggers deciding to hide that information. They may feel like their content is being judged badly by people who are not even watching their videos based on how few subscribers they have. Building up a higher number using Sub4Sub may allow some YouTubers to move past these concerns and get back to focusing on making good videos.</p><h4 id="3-Cons-of-Sub4Sub-2"><a href="#3-Cons-of-Sub4Sub-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Cons of Sub4Sub"></a>3. Cons of Sub4Sub</h4><p> The reality is that if people are pre-judging your videos based on your stats it is not subscribers they are looking at so much as views. Sub4Sub helps you get subscribers, but in most cases those subscribers will never watch any of your videos. They will also never share them or tell their friends to watch them, the way subscribers gained organically will. So while your subscriber count goes up, your view count stays low.</p><p> The situation described in the Pros section, where you talk to each other and comment on each other’s videos, is rare. You are more likely to make friends with other YouTubers after you have already watched each other’s videos or after chatting in a forum. It is worth trying to engage a vlogger with a similar topic to yours if they ask you to sub for sub, but most people who ask will have no intention of interacting with you beyond subscribing to each other. Realistically if you are going to use sub for sub to increase your subscriber count by any significant number you will not have time to have actual conversations with everyone you approach, or to watch their videos.</p><p> When you agree to exchange subscriptions with somebody there is also the danger that they will decide to unsubscribe from your channel afterwards. This could happen much later when they realize they do not want to be subscribed to so many people and have forgotten which channels were parts of Sub4Sub agreements. Or it could happen within weeks, days, or even hours of you subscribing to them. There are some dishonest YouTubers who use sub for sub to get subscribers while already planning to unsubscribe to anybody who agrees. Their hope is that the other person will not notice or will not bother unsubscribing from them if they do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-7"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-7" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Sometimes YouTubers with smaller channels feel like their small subscriber counts are holding them back. There is some truth to this. When you have a higher number of subscribers it is easier to get even more. That is why some users try to use methods like Sub4Sub to improve their numbers.</p><p> Sub4Sub, or ‘sub for sub’, is the practice of subscribing to somebody else’s channel in exchange for them subscribing to yours. Whether Sub4Sub works is debatable, but it is fairly popular. YouTubers often send messages to other YouTubers asking if they would like to sub for sub, and there are even off-YouTube sites devoted to connecting YouTubers so they can subscribe to each other.
