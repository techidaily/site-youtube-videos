# How To Light Your YouTube Video

When it comes to sensitivity to light, no consumer-level camera sensor comes close in performance to the human eye. Many newbies to videography, though, don’t think about this when they use their camera indoors and discover that their recorded footage appears too dark.

If you want to use your camera indoors as many YouTubers do, you’ll need to have extra light. But the solution is not as simple as surrounding yourself with lamps that are all randomly placed.

Below, I’ll go into detail on how you can set up your lighting equipment to make your YouTube videos look good.

## Part 1: Using Light You Already Have

Most beginner YouTubers light their videos with what they already have. That’s what I did to start as well. In the past, my video recording space consisted of natural sunlight coming from my window and ceiling light for times when the sunlight wasn’t strong enough.

### 1.  Window Lighting

The best thing about window lighting is that it’s free. The worst thing about it is that it’s uncontrollable. The amount of light you get in your video can vary with all the changes in the weather.

Window lighting for me was especially difficult to work with because I live in a very rainy and cloudy city, Vancouver, Canada, where we pretty much just get three months of good sun.

![  YouTube Video Lighting ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-lighting-comparison.jpg)

Above are two freeze frames from one of Daniel's past window-lit vlogs. Although these two frames are both from the same vlog, you can see that the image on the right looks brighter due to clearer skies at that moment. These varying amounts of light is what you will have to deal with if you choose to light your YouTube video with window lighting.

### 2. Home Lighting

Home lighting is another source of light that many new YouTubers use. In the past, when my window light wasn’t strong enough to light my video recording space, I would turn on the ceiling light.

![Mixed Lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-lighting-for-youtube-videos.jpg)

Notice how the color of Daniel's skin looks much more orange here (above) than the color of the skin in the two side-by-side window lighting examples? The side of the face also appears to look bluer. This all happened because he mixed up different color temperatures shining out of the two lights (cooler window light and warmer ceiling light).

Most home lighting is warmer in its color temperature. If you want to use your home lights without everything being orange-tinted, you’ll need to switch out your light bulbs for daytime LED light bulbs.

Ceiling lights are also typically situated in the center of a room in order to light an entire room evenly. This is not likely to be the best location for your filming video. Since the ceiling light was directly above the face in the above example, you can see harder shadows beneath his cheeks.

## Part 2: Home Studio Lighting

If you rather not deal with all the window and home lighting challenges, you can set up studio lighting in your home.

### 1. Light Control

The first thing you’ll want to do to set up studio lighting in your home is to pick a room to film in and eliminate as much external lighting as you can. Use blinds, curtains, towels, or any thick fabric to block sunlight from shining into your room.

### 2. 3-Point Lighting

The most common setup for studio lighting is 3-point lighting. For this kind of lighting you’ll need three lights: a key light, a fill light, and a back light (also called a hair light).

![3-Point Lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-lighting-3-point-lighting.jpg)

Out of the three lights, the key light should be the brightest. When it is positioned to the left of you (as shown in the diagram above) your right side will have shadows.

To minimize the shadows on your right side, use a weaker light as a fill light. You don’t want your fill light to completely eliminate all your shadows or else your shot will look flat.

Lastly, a backlight positioned behind you can give an appealing highlight to the ends of your head and even help to separate your hair from blending into your background if both happen to be dark.

### 3. 4-Point Lighting

As a YouTuber, you may not only want yourself to be seen optimally with proper lighting, but you may also want your background to be seen optimally, especially if you’ve taken the time to decorate it for your audience.

What you’ll need to ensure that your background is sufficiently lit is 4-point lighting setup. The 4-point lighting setup is the same as a 3-point lighting setup, but with an additional light shining at your background.

### Touch Up YouTube Videos with Filmora

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the best video editing software for YouTube beginners to start the YouTube channel. So, if you find the lighting isn't perfect after recording, you can use the Auto Color Enhancement feature in Filmora to adjust the color with one-click. Or, you can change the white balance, Light, color, and HSL manually. Filmora also features some presets and [LUTs templates](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which allows you to apply pre-programmed effects to video for color correction faster.

## Streamline Your YouTube Presentations with Captions

# How To Add Captions to YouTube Videos

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

By captioning your YouTube videos you help to make them accessible to more potential viewers. Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.

This article will first explain how you can turn on subtitles for the videos you watch and then walk you through adding captions to your own videos.

## How To Turn On Captions on YouTube

In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.

![captions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG)

To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.

If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your **Account Settings** and selecting **Playback**. Check the box next to **Always Show Captions**, and then check   **Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition**. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The **Always Show Captions** feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.

If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   **Subtitles/CC** . If the language you want is not there select **Auto-Translate**  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.

## Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps

1\. Go to **Video Manager** in your **Creator Studio** and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.

2\. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose **Subtitles and CC**.

3\. Select **Add New** **Subtitles or CC**.

4\. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.

**Create Subtitles or Closed Captions** will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.

**Upload A File** allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.

**Transcribe and Set Timings** is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.

**Use Automatic Captioning** will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.

**Use Captioning Software or Services** is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.

The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use **Automatic Captioning**. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.

In order for you to be able to view subtitles for a YouTube video the uploader of the video will need to have added them, unless you change your account settings to display automatic captions.

![captions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/captions-how-to-turn-on.JPG)

To toggle subtitles on and off click on the Closed Captioning icon in the bottom right of your video player.

If the creator of the video has not added captions then you can enable automatic captions by going into your **Account Settings** and selecting **Playback**. Check the box next to **Always Show Captions**, and then check   **Show Automatic Captions by Speech Recognition**. These captions may be flawed, but you will still be able to see the more accurate user submitted captions on videos that have them. The **Always Show Captions** feature may be useful not only to the hearing impaired, but to users who do not speak the same language as the video producer.

If you want to change the language of the subtitles click on the settings icon (the one that looks like a gear) next to the closed captioning icon and choose your language next to   **Subtitles/CC** . If the language you want is not there select **Auto-Translate**  and then pick a language. Google Translate will be used to generate subtitles in your chosen language.

## Adding YouTube Captions in 4 Steps

1\. Go to **Video Manager** in your **Creator Studio** and then look at your videos. Decide which one you want to add captions to.

2\. Click on the drop-down menu next to the video you want to add captions to and choose **Subtitles and CC**.

3\. Select **Add New** **Subtitles or CC**.

4\. Choose whether to create your captions, upload a file that has them, transcribe your video, use automatic captioning, or use captioning software.

**Create Subtitles or Closed Captions** will allow you to create your subtitles on YouTube.

**Upload A File** allows you to upload a pre-made subtitle file from your computer. Supported file types include SubRip (.srt) and SubViewer (.sbv). You cannot use a word or PDF document for your subtitles.

**Transcribe and Set Timings** is where you can type a transcript of your video and set timings to sync it to your video. This differs from Create Subtitles or Closed Captions in that your transcript is all typed in to one text field.

**Use Automatic Captioning** will automatically use speech recognition technology to create captions. You can edit these auto-generated captions later if there are mistakes.

**Use Captioning Software or Services** is what you choose if you want to use a program or service to create the subtitles for your video.

The easiest way to add subtitles to your videos is to use **Automatic Captioning**. However, Automatic Captioning is imperfect and may result in your viewers getting a sloppy, skewed, interpretation of your video. Automatic captions are also not indexed by YouTube and Google the way subtitles you create or upload are. This means that they will not have any value to your SEO strategy. If you do not input your own captions or transcript you are missing out on an opportunity for better search engine rankings. Automatic Captions are great if you do not have time to input subtitles and need a temporary solution, though.

By captioning your YouTube videos you help to make them accessible to more potential viewers. Subtitles are useful to viewers who have hearing impairments, whose first language is different from yours, or who are unable to watch your video with sound. Closed captioning can also be useful for you as a YouTuber because it helps with your SEO, or search engine optimization. Practicing better SEO can get your videos ranked higher in search results. Google and YouTube both index subtitles and transcripts much like they do your video’s description, unless you use automated captions.
