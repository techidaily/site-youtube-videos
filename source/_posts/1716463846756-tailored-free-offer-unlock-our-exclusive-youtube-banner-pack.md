But the main essence is, following any method will show how to remove shorts from YouTube. So, now go with the methods one by one and follow the guidelines to remove shorts from YouTube.

### Method 1: Three dots option

One of the primary things you can do with any short videos is to click on the three dots next to each of such videos if you are not particularly willing to see something. Doing so will open the pop-up window, which will give you the option of “Not interested”. Click on this option. That’s it. Next time, such a video will not appear to you while surfing videos on YouTube.

Here, no doubt the method is simple, but this method needs repetitiveness. As, whenever you see Shorts videos, you need to click on three dots to remove that.

### Method 2: Settings menu of YouTube

At your YouTube homepage at the top end, you will see the profile icon. If you click on it, that will lead you towards the **Settings** menu of YouTube.

From there, you need to select “General”, which will show up some options. Here, click on the Shorts option to turn it off.

When you click on the **Uninstall** option, the YouTube version will get downgraded to the factory version. This is the version that is a pre-installed version of YouTube that comes with the device.

Also, if you have not updated your YouTube app, then don’t go with that. However, you will receive notifications many times that you should update your application. Just ignore it, especially if you are not willing to add the Shorts video option on your YouTube application.

### Method 5: Link to downgrade the YouTube

Friends, for every problem, there exists some solution. And, if you are finding it difficult to factory reset the YouTube, you can download the downgraded version of YouTube. This is the version that does not contain the YouTube Shorts feature. Do like this:

1. Visit the [Link](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-14-12-56-release/youtube-14-12-56-16-android-apk-download/) and download the downgraded version.
