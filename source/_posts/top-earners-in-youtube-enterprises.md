With 1,300,000,000 daily users, YouTube offers instant access to one of the largest audiences on the Internet to all video content producers. The best part is, that you can create your own channel for free and start uploading videos today.

However, it is worth noting that success doesn't come overnight and all of the highest-paid YouTubers had to work hard to get to where they are now. Another fascinating fact is that most of the people frequently mentioned in these discussions are under 30 years old. So let's have a look at **the top ten richest YouTubers.**.

## Top 10 Richest YouTubers

**Who is the richest YouTuber?** Well, we've done some research and found some of the highest-paid YouTubers on the market. Things change but we'll try our best efforts to keep the info up to date.

* [Ryan Kaji (YouTube Channel: Ryan's World)](#part1)
* [Mr. Beast (Jimmy Donaldson)](#part2)
* [Dude Perfect](#part3)
* [Mark Edward Fischbach (YouTube Channel: Markiplier)](#part4)
* [Logan Paul](#part5)
* [Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (YouTube Channel: PewDiePie)](#part6)
* [Jake Paul](#part7)
* [Daniel Middleton (YouTube Channel: DanTDM)](#part8)
* [Smosh](#part9)
* [Lilly Singh (YouTube Channel: IISuperwomanII)](#part10)

#### 1. [Ryan Kaji (YouTube Channel: Ryan's World)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChGJGhZ9SOOHvBB0Y4DOO%5Fw)

**Earnings:** $29.5 million

**Subscribers:** 41.7 million

Is it unbelievable that the richest YouTubers in 2024 is a nine-year-old boy?

Ryan Kaji, whose YouTube channel name is Ryan's world, managed to get 30 million subscribers in over five years and is one of the most successful kid YouTubers. Just as he wrote in his bio - Ryan is crazy about doing lots of funny things like pretend play, science experiments, music videos, skits, challenges, DIY arts and crafts, and more! Ryan turned his hobbies into creative educational videos, which inspired millions of children.

#### 2. [Mr. Beast (Jimmy Donaldson)](https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000/featured)

**Earnings:** $24 million

**Subscribers:** 47.8 million

Despite having 7 million more subscribers than the Ryan's World channel, Donaldson's fortune is currently 5.5 million short of being the largest among YouTubers. As YouTube’s biggest new star, it is still stunning enough for almost 50 million subscribers. As a matter of fact, his ambition is far more than that - 100 million subscribers and 3 billion views during 2021.

His videos combine stunts and humor. In the past half a year, Jimmy experienced prison life, built the largest Lego Tower in the world, sit in a tub of snakes for $10,000, etc. No one would deny all these incredible videos.

#### 3. [Dude Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/user/corycotton)

**Earnings:** $14 million

**Subscribers:** 43 million

The Dude Perfect group has 5 members, and the Cotton twins Cory and Coby are the core of this team, but their three high school friends have been a part of the project from the beginning. Besides running one of the most subscribed channels on YouTube the Dude Perfect crew also has their own mobile app just named Dude Perfect which is available on iOS and Android. And they have built a partnership with Nickelodeon and have a TV show called The Dude Perfect Show.

Most of their YouTube videos are centered around sports activities and they all contain elements of comedy that have significantly contributed to the popularity of the Dude Perfect YouTube channel, and most of their videos are sponsored. The fact that their videos often feature professional athletes and celebrities such as Tyreke Evans, Johnny Manziel, or Tim McGraw also contributed to the swift success of the crew.

#### 4. [Mark Edward Fischbach (YouTube Channel: Markiplier)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7%5FYxT-KID8kRbqZo7MyscQ)

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

**Subscribers:** 23 million

Yet another gaming video producer made his way to the list of top ten richest YouTube superstars. Mark Fischbach mostly produces LetsPlay videos and is known for his over-the-top commentary style that often involves yelling or cursing.

Mark likes indie and horror video games and for that reason most videos on his Markiplier YouTube channel cover games such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Slender: The Eight Pages. In addition to being one of the most popular YouTubers in 2021, Mark is also a voice actor who appeared on several TV shows.

#### 5. [Logan Paul](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8rbF3g2AMX70yOd8vqIZg)

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

The vlogger who caught the public eye with the recent Japanese suicide incident hasn't lost much of his YouTube subscribers despite his controversial behavior. As a matter of fact, his popularity seems to be on the rise at the moment since his videos got over 3 billion views in the three years since he started his YouTube channel. However, this may only be a fluke and his popularity may plummet if he continues to produce shocking but mediocre videos.

His daredevil style has launched this 22-year old to YouTube stardom, but as time passes it will be hard for Logan to maintain this level of success.

#### 6. [Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg (YouTube Channel: PewDiePie)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24%5FVd%5FAJ5Yw)

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

**Subscribers:**  96 million

Felix Kjellberg is the owner of the most subscribed channel on YouTube and he is only 28 years old. The Swedish gaming commentator is probably one of the richest Internet celebrities because his net worth is estimated at between $30 and $50 million.

However, he seems to be past his prime, and for the second straight year, Felix's annual income is declining. Aside from the work he's done in the realm of gaming, the world's most popular YouTuber has also published a book that sold more than 112,00 copies and he hosted a web series on YouTube Red titled Scare PewDiePie.

#### 7. [Jake Paul](https://www.youtube.com/user/JakePaulProductions)

**Earnings:** $11.5 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

Jake Paul is Logan Paul's younger brother, who is an actor, a musician, and a YouTube video producer who first gained recognition on Vine. He's been on YouTube since 2013, and in the subsequent years, videos on his channel collected over 4 billion views.

His song 'It's Everyday Bro' was released on May 30\. 2017 had 70 million views in a single month, but it later went on to become the third most disliked video on YouTube. Jake is only 22 and if he manages to avoid scandals and controversy he may stay among the richest YouTubers for the years to come.

#### 8. [Daniel Middleton (YouTube Channel: DanTDM)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Oz6CHmeoF7vSad0qqXfw)

**Earnings:** $11 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

Who said that gaming is a waste of time? Currently, the richest man on YouTube gaming channel has made his fortune on Minecraft videos, although Daniel Middleton, the owner of the most profitable channel on YouTube has also had quite a bit of success outside of the platform.

Daniel is from the United Kingdom and this British guy who was born in 1991 has published several comic books and starred in a number of TV shows (such as Skylanders Academy) and a YouTube Red Series, but the majority of his income still comes from the views he gets on his Minecraft videos, including gaming sponsorships and merchandise. He even has a second channel called MoreTDM though which was not active in recent years.

#### 9. [Smosh](https://www.youtube.com/user/smosh)

**Earnings:** $11 million

**Subscribers:** 24 million

This is by far the oldest YouTube channel on this list since the duo of slapstick comedians Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla joined the platform back in 2005\. Over the years they have produced some iconic video-game music videos and parodies.

Smosh also has a number of ongoing web series that have attracted nearly 7 billion views and they have won numerous awards. In 2015 Smoosh: The Movie, was released, featuring Hecox and Padilla as themselves, but the film received only mild critical acclaim. Anthony Padilla stopped working on Smosh videos and started his own YouTube channel in 2017.

#### 10. [Lilly Singh (YouTube Channel: IISuperwomanII)](https://www.youtube.com/user/IISuperwomanII)

**Earnings:** $10.5 million

**Subscribers:** 14 million

The Canadian vlogger, comedy video producer, and singer Lilly Singh is the face behind an enormously popular YouTube channel called Superwoman. There is very little doubt that Lilly is indeed a superwoman because in 2021 her estimated earnings will surpass the $10 million mark.

This incredibly talented and beautiful Canadian has been producing YouTube videos since 2010, her videos have collected over 2 billion views. In addition to being a YouTube superstar, Lilly has also made appearances in feature films like Dr. Cabbie, Fahrenheit 451, or Bad Moms., to mention a few. Hopefully, her acting career will be as successful as her YouTube videos.

**Conclusion:**

Young stars are born every day, but reaching the heights of the top ten highest-paid YouTubers requires patience, hard work, and most of all a stroke of luck. The world's largest video-sharing platform offers great opportunities for young people who want to share their skills, thoughts, and ideas with the rest of the world, but it also demands a lot of creativity and dedication.

Ryan Kaji, whose YouTube channel name is Ryan's world, managed to get 30 million subscribers in over five years and is one of the most successful kid YouTubers.

**Earnings:** $24 million

**Subscribers:** 47.8 million

Despite having 7 million more subscribers than the Ryan's World channel, Donaldson's fortune is currently 5.5 million short of being the largest among YouTubers. As YouTube’s biggest new star, it is still stunning enough for almost 50 million subscribers. As a matter of fact, his ambition is far more than that - 100 million subscribers and 3 billion views during 2021.

His videos combine stunts and humor. In the past half a year, Jimmy experienced prison life, built the largest Lego Tower in the world, sit in a tub of snakes for $10,000, etc. No one would deny all these incredible videos.

And they have built a partnership with Nickelodeon and have a TV show called The Dude Perfect Show.

Most of their YouTube videos are centered around sports activities and they all contain elements of comedy that have significantly contributed to the popularity of the Dude Perfect YouTube channel, and most of their videos are sponsored. The fact that their videos often feature professional athletes and celebrities such as Tyreke Evans, Johnny Manziel, or Tim McGraw also contributed to the swift success of the crew.

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

In addition to being one of the most popular YouTubers in 2021, Mark is also a voice actor who appeared on several TV shows.

**Earnings:** $12.5 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

As a matter of fact, his popularity seems to be on the rise at the moment since his videos got over 3 billion views in the three years since he started his YouTube channel. However, this may only be a fluke and his popularity may plummet if he continues to produce shocking but mediocre videos.

His daredevil style has launched this 22-year old to YouTube stardom, but as time passes it will be hard for Logan to maintain this level of success.

Felix Kjellberg is the owner of the most subscribed channel on YouTube and he is only 28 years old. The Swedish gaming commentator is probably one of the richest Internet celebrities because his net worth is estimated at between $30 and $50 million.

Aside from the work he's done in the realm of gaming, the world's most popular YouTuber has also published a book that sold more than 112,00 copies and he hosted a web series on YouTube Red titled Scare PewDiePie.

His song 'It's Everyday Bro' was released on May 30\. 2017 had 70 million views in a single month, but it later went on to become the third most disliked video on YouTube. Jake is only 22 and if he manages to avoid scandals and controversy he may stay among the richest YouTubers for the years to come.

#### 8. [Daniel Middleton (YouTube Channel: DanTDM)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Oz6CHmeoF7vSad0qqXfw)

**Earnings:** $11 million

**Subscribers:** 19 million

Who said that gaming is a waste of time? Currently, the richest man on YouTube gaming channel has made his fortune on Minecraft videos, although Daniel Middleton, the owner of the most profitable channel on YouTube has also had quite a bit of success outside of the platform.

Daniel is from the United Kingdom and this British guy who was born in 1991 has published several comic books and starred in a number of TV shows (such as Skylanders Academy) and a YouTube Red Series, but the majority of his income still comes from the views he gets on his Minecraft videos, including gaming sponsorships and merchandise.

Smosh also has a number of ongoing web series that have attracted nearly 7 billion views and they have won numerous awards. In 2015 Smoosh: The Movie, was released, featuring Hecox and Padilla as themselves, but the film received only mild critical acclaim. Anthony Padilla stopped working on Smosh videos and started his own YouTube channel in 2017.

#### 10. [Lilly Singh (YouTube Channel: IISuperwomanII)](https://www.youtube.com/user/IISuperwomanII)

**Earnings:** $10.5 million

**Subscribers:** 14 million

The Canadian vlogger, comedy video producer, and singer Lilly Singh is the face behind an enormously popular YouTube channel called Superwoman. There is very little doubt that Lilly is indeed a superwoman because in 2021 her estimated earnings will surpass the $10 million mark.

This incredibly talented and beautiful Canadian has been producing YouTube videos since 2010, her videos have collected over 2 billion views.

## Iconic Gaming Themes: The Ultimate Template Collection

Gaming videos have become increasingly popular on YouTube, especially among young people. It is not uncommon for older folk to enjoy this type of content, especially if they want to unwind after a long day. However, the industry is becoming pretty crowded, making it harder for content creators to stand out from the crowd.

An excellent way to get your target audience to notice you would be to design a killer YouTube banner that will immediately cause anyone scrolling past to click on your video. Stick around to learn how to create a great gaming YouTube banner with templates.

![pholody interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gaming-youtube-banner-template.gif)

## Importance of a Banner for Your YouTube Gaming Channel

Imagine a scenario where you want to open a brick-and-mortar store. One of the most important things you need to get out of the way is the business name. Once you have settled on a fitting name, you will then move on to create a sign to place outside your shop.

For example, a banner for your YouTube gaming channel plays a similar role to signage for a brick-and-mortar shop.

* An excellent banner helps you make a solid first impression on your viewers, some of who is viewing your content for the first time.
* Secondly, a well-designed banner reflects positively on your brand and helps you grow your audience at a steady rate.
* Thirdly, you can use your banner to give your viewers a rough idea of what your video is about without them clicking to watch. A suitable banner can cause anticipation to build within your viewers. Once the video is over, they won’t resist visiting your channel to see what else you offer.

## Guide to YouTube Gaming Banner Size

We can liken a banner for your YouTube video to a book cover to a novel you have been dying to read. Therefore, it would be wise to get the size right if you want to create an excellent first impression for yourself. Ideally, the best size for a YouTube banner is 2560\*1440 pixels or an aspect ratio of 16:9.

We urge you not to upload a banner smaller than 2048\*1152 pixels, or else the image will appear cropped. Keep your banner within 1235\*338 pixels and centered on the screen to be on the safe side.

This YouTube banner dimension is ideal for viewing on any device since your audience might use their smartphones or laptop to watch your videos on YouTube. Lastly, ensure you keep the file to a maximum of 6MB. We believe this file size is pretty generous.

## Tips for Designing an Attractive Gaming YouTube Banner

Below are some tips that will help you create beautiful YouTube banners.

Simplicity is key: Contrary to popular belief, a simple banner looks more polished than a complex one. If your YouTube banner has too many elements, your viewers using their mobile phones might have a challenge viewing the image.

Ensure the graphics are high-quality : Nothing is as frustrating to your viewers as seeing a blurry or pixelated YouTube banner. However, high-quality graphics with a resolution of at least 1920\*1080 pixels make your work look polished and attract more viewers to your channel.

Leverage the grid system: Some of your viewers might watch your videos from their smartphones, and others on their laptops or tablets. The grid system allows you to ensure the full banner will be visible no matter what device your audience will use to watch your gaming videos.

Add a CTA: At the end of the day, you are trying to grow your audience on your YouTube channel. You might also have other social media platforms where you post content. Since your banner is one of the first things your audience will see, you could include a short, easy-to-read, and understandable call to action. For instance, you could encourage them to “Subscribe Now!”

Incorporate your unique color scheme: By now, you already have a theme for your YouTube channel that your existing subscribers associate with you. As you design your YouTube banner, ensure you incorporate your theme colors, so new visitors know what colors to look out for as they scroll on the platform.

## Why Use Templates To Create Gaming YouTube Banners?

First and foremost, a gaming youtube banner template takes the tedium out of creating a design from scratch. They are also systematized, meaning you can download a template specifically for YouTube that comes in the correct dimensions. Most importantly, templates designed for gaming YouTube banners are optimized to help you generate more organic traffic to your channel.
