## Part 1: What is a VR video on YouTube?

Firstly, it is essential to understand a VR Video on YouTube and how it differs from 360 videos?

VR Videos YouTube – For VR Videos with the YouTube mobile app, you can watch VR videos alongside cardboard. You will have an immersive feeling while watching this as you feel present in the scene actions while having your field of vision covered with a viewing device.

Though both YouTube VR and 360 give an immersive viewing experience with 360-degree coverage, still YouTube 360 videos reflect live actions with modified cameras accessible through 360-degree video-compatible devices. YouTube 360 videos are also viewable on devices such as smartphones, computers, etc., that are compatible. However, here, video progression is not under viewers' control.

On the other hand, VR videos with VR headsets give options to control the viewing experience, such as interacting, running, walk with the video from the viewer's end.
