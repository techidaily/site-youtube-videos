## Why Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?

When people are searching for something to watch on YouTube, they'll look at two (2) things:

1. They'll check the title to see how relevant it is to what they're looking for.
2. Two, they'll check the video thumbnail.

![youutbe thumbnail negativespace](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-negativespace.jpg)

NegativeSpace is the perfect place to get your YouTube thumbnail background if you are on a tight budget. It allows you not only to download the photos but also to use them commercially! And the photos are high-quality too, and they're meant to be used as backgrounds.

Please note, however, that if you're looking for vector illustrations, you'd better be on another site. NegativeSpace is built by a community of photographers. So, most of the resources you can download from this website are photos captured by a camera.

## How To Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?

Suppose you have downloaded a high-quality image that will work great as a thumbnail background for your YouTube video. What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.

Choosing the background image from [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora's native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube's suggested thumbnail size.

It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don't have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.

Filmora's tools for editing the video thumbnail aren't too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more. You can use Wondershare Filmora's AI Portrait feature to easily change it.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### What is Filmora's AI Portrait Feature?

Wondershare Filmora's AI Portrait feature allows you to quickly remove and change the background of an image.

Normally, you would need a green screen or chroma key to do that. Another method is to manually erase the background using an eraser. The AI Portrait feature has an effect called "human segmentation." It separates the humans in an image from the background. Then, you can delete or change the background with the thumbnail background that you have downloaded. It's really convenient!

Here is a guide on changing a YouTube thumbnail background using Wondershare Filmora.

1\. Put the Thumbnail image in the timeline.

![youtube thumbnail bg 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-filmora-1.jpg)

2\. Select the thumbnail image. Click "Tools" > "Video" > "AI Portrait."

![youtube thumbnail bg 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-filmora-2.jpg)

3\. The AI Portrait tool will remove the background automatically. Click "OK."

![youtube thumbnail bg 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-filmora-3.jpg)

4\. Click "Stock Media" > "Photos." Search for a background image that you like. Download the photo.

![youtube thumbnail bg 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-filmora-4.jpg)

5\. Drag the new background to the track below your thumbnail image.

![youtube thumbnail bg 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-filmora-5.jpg)

6\. Select your thumbnail image to adjust its size and position.

![youtube thumbnail bg 6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-filmora-6.jpg)

7\. Click the camera icon to take a snapshot of the still frame you want to use as the YouTube video thumbnail.

![youtube thumbnail bg 7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-filmora-7.jpg)

8\. Select the format and storage path.

![youtube thumbnail bg 8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-filmora-8.jpg)

9\. Find the icon of the snapshot in the Media tab. Right-click and select "Reveal In Explorer" to open your local folder to find the new thumbnail.

![youtube thumbnail bg 9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-thumbnail-background-filmora-9.jpg)

## The Bottom Line

Your YouTube video thumbnail is almost as important as the video content itself. So you must not neglect it. Ensuring it is high-quality is important. One big step in doing that is selecting a great thumbnail background image. You can find these in many places.

The video editor Wondershare Filmora even allows you to browse for some within the program! Furthermore, Filmora provides you with tools to edit the thumbnail. In turn, it streamlines the whole process. Give it a try to start creating video thumbnails that will make YouTube users click on your video easily.

The [YouTube Creator Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an essential aspect of managing a successful channel (click here to learn more about the [Analytics section of your Creator Studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)). Using the tools available in the Creator studio you can manage your videos, interact with your audience, and keep track of important video statistics.

The Creator Studioâ€™s interface is customizable so you can add or remove widgets based on the tools that you most commonly use.

On the main dashboard of the Creator Studio, you will see a menu that includes your video manager, live streaming support, community page, channel page, analytics, translations, and transcriptions.

Also on the dashboard, you can see analytics for the most successful videos that you have posted.

## Adjusting the Dashboard

Pinning new charts to the dashboard will ensure that all of the data you need most often is easily viewable upon first entering the Creator Studio. All you need to do to add new widgets to the dashboard sidebar is to use the **add widget** feature.

Making adjustments to your current widgets simply involves clicking on the gear icon in the top right corner to add custom tiles as well as rearrange the order of the various widgets that you have selected.

## YouTube Creator Studio Tools

**Video Manager:** from the Video Manager section you can view any of the videos that you have posted to YouTube. This menu includes all of your uploaded videos whether they are public, unlisted, or private. You can see advanced statistics on every one of the videos you posted as well as download MP4s of your videos for re-editing. The video manager allows you to very quickly select multiple videos and then add them to a playlist.

**Live streaming**: YouTube has made it easy for anyone with a verified account to go live. There are even special monetization features specifically for live streaming. Streaming is especially vital to the gaming genre on YouTube.

**Analytics:** the analytic section is essential to your success as a video creator. Through analytics, you can see which of your videos are most successful in terms of watch time, views, or monetization and you can even check how many new subscribers individual videos are attracting to your channel. This information is important because once you know whatâ€™s working you can keep doing it and start growing your channel faster.

Other information you can access through your Creator Studio includes the demographics (nationality, gender, age) of your viewers, video comments, your subscriber list, and any information related to copyright strikes.

How many times a week do you check your stats in the YouTube Creator Studio?
