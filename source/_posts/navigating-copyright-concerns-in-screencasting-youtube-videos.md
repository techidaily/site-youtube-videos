 YouTube Kids is the alternative version of YouTubeâ€™s video service dedicated and designed for kids. Itâ€™s entirely for children with all the content curated for kidsâ€™ education, family-friendly videos, and channels surrounding kidâ€™s liking. The interface features colorful large images, and icons with five categories to explore from.

 The app filters all the content allowing only safe content and parental control to watch their childrenâ€™s online activity. The app prevents commenting and any kind of cyber bullying-related issues. YouTube Kids need to be set up by an adult with singing into the app with their Google credentials. Parents can sign in and block channels or videos they donâ€™t see fit for their children. Let us see how to block YouTube channels on YouTube kids.
