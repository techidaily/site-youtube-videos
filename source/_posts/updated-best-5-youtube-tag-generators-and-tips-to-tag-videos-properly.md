## How to Tag Properly on YouTube?

#### Tip 1 Relevancy

The most important thing that you need to know about channel tags is that one must always stay away from misleading tags. Always check the relevance of tags or keywords before you add them to your channel. Working with highly relevant keywords may develop a slower route map to success with top rankings but it always promises a sustainable and more legitimate solution.

#### Tip 2 Mix Long Tail and General Tags

It is not sufficient to use general tags for channel posts, rather one should go for a mixture of the long tail and general tags. It helps to make your data more valuable because it can address a wide range of audience.

#### Tip 3 Use Around 10 Tags

You will not be able to get desired results with 3 or 4 tags, however, you won't need 15 or 20 tags; rather an optimized solution is preferred. The best idea is to use almost 10 tags for one post as it can make your posts more relevant to the specific audience.

#### Tip 4 Analyze Competitors

Never forget to check the tags of your competitors; it will help you to improve your results against them. There are so many tools available online that can help you to track tags of your competitors so that you can also use a similar set of potential keywords.

#### Tip 5  Monitor and Update Tags

Stay tuned to new trends and then adjust strategy accordingly to make them more effective. It is a good idea to bring the best value to your videos with relevant audience attraction. It will soon update your videos into suggestions for related search results of the audience. On one side, it helps to make the perfect link between two related videos and at the same time, it helps to rank videos with higher ranking due to more specific keywords.

## How to Tag Properly on YouTube?

#### Tip 1 Relevancy

The most important thing that you need to know about channel tags is that one must always stay away from misleading tags. Always check the relevance of tags or keywords before you add them to your channel. Working with highly relevant keywords may develop a slower route map to success with top rankings but it always promises a sustainable and more legitimate solution.

#### Tip 2 Mix Long Tail and General Tags

It is not sufficient to use general tags for channel posts, rather one should go for a mixture of the long tail and general tags. It helps to make your data more valuable because it can address a wide range of audience.

#### Tip 3 Use Around 10 Tags

You will not be able to get desired results with 3 or 4 tags, however, you won't need 15 or 20 tags; rather an optimized solution is preferred. The best idea is to use almost 10 tags for one post as it can make your posts more relevant to the specific audience.

#### Tip 4 Analyze Competitors

Never forget to check the tags of your competitors; it will help you to improve your results against them. There are so many tools available online that can help you to track tags of your competitors so that you can also use a similar set of potential keywords.

#### Tip 5  Monitor and Update Tags

Stay tuned to new trends and then adjust strategy accordingly to make them more effective. It is a good idea to bring the best value to your videos with relevant audience attraction. It will soon update your videos into suggestions for related search results of the audience. On one side, it helps to make the perfect link between two related videos and at the same time, it helps to rank videos with higher ranking due to more specific keywords.
