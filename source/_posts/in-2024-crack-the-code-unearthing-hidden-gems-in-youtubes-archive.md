## Crack the Code: Unearthing Hidden Gems in YouTube's Archive

You may have noticed that some videos in your YouTube playlist are unavailable. This is because the platform allows content creators to categorize their videos into public, private, or unlisted based on their preferences.

To help you uncover the content that you otherwise wouldn't have access to, we've compiled a detailed guide to show you how to find YouTube hidden videos. We've also explained why so many unlisted videos are now labeled as private.

So, let's get started with our guide without any further delay!

## 4 Types of Videos on YouTube

Firstly, let's learn about the background of the types of YouTube videos. YouTube videos fall into the following four broad categories:

**Public Videos:** YouTube contains videos on many themes and topics. It makes it impossible to watch all uploaded content under a specific category.

So, whenever you search for a video or theme, a list of content is displayed in the search result: "**Public** **Videos**." It means that they are visible to everyone around the globe (depending on the terms and conditions). Moreover, you can share, like, unlike, download, or add these videos to your playlists for later watching.

**Private Videos**: Private videos on YouTube can only be seen by people invited by the person who uploaded the video. This means that only those with access to the video's shareable link can watch it.

Private videos are not visible to the public or to people who are not logged into YouTube. Hence, it is a great way to share sensitive or personal information with a select group.

![private video on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/private-video-on-youtube.png)

**Unlisted Video** Unlisted videos on YouTube are not publicly visible on the site. They can only be seen by people who have the URL. This category works as a bridge between private and public videos. It is accessible only through sharable links without appealing in any YouTube public playlist or search result.

You might upload an unlisted video to YouTube if you do not want everyone to see it. However, you still want to share it with specific people, like your friends or family. You might also use an unlisted video to test out a new idea before making it public on the video-sharing platform.

**Age-Restricted Videos**: Age-restricted videos on YouTube are not suitable for all audiences. It may contain content that includes violence, profanity, sexual content, and other inappropriate material. YouTube requires that users be at least 18 years old to view these types of videos.

If you search on YouTube and come across an age-restricted video, you will be asked to confirm your age before viewing its content.

## How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos

Now that we've learned about the four types of YouTube content, let's discuss how you can find unlisted YouTube videos:

### How To Find Other People's Unlisted YouTube Videos?

### How To Find Unlisted YouTube Videos with Google
