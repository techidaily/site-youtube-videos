A YouTube thumbnail must be made very engaging and attractive to tell the potential viewers what the video is about and make them watch it. Since YouTube is a visual media platform, viewers set their eyes on the thumbnails first before they read the title of the video.

Online, there are several tools dedicated to solving this exact problem. These are the top five YouTube Thumbnail grabbers:
