## Methods to add a subscribe button to your video

Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided. One best method is to engage a subscribe button to your video and draw the attention of as many as possible.

#### 1 Use Subscribe Green Screen

Put your green screen to work by subscribing to it. Follow these steps to produce eye-catching videos, with a call to action closing point.

**Step 1\. Set screen**
You need to create a background at the Studio – and that's the green screen. Keenly hand it on a frame before you start filming. Also, note that no wrinkles or fold-ups are visible.

**Step 2\. Adjust lighting**  
Lighting is important to facilitate high-resolution video output quality. Put appropriate lighting settings to avoid directional shadows and get the best results.

**Step 3\. Set up the subject**  
Give ample space between the subject and the green screen for an effective outcome. If they are too close, there will be a reflection of the green screen on the subject. It isn't professional as it will be hard when it comes to matching to a different background.

**Step 4\. Start filming**  
Begin to film your video and ensure you take various shots for comparison. It is good to film at different angles to see what works best.

**Step 5\. Polish the rough cut**  
Tune all the footage to perfect video clips. It will save your efforts when keying out green screen footage. Remove the unwanted parts by trimming. You can also do other edits like merge and split where necessary.

**Step 6\. Key out the footage and edit the green screen**  
Your footage is now ready, and you are now free to edit the green screen. It is better to engage reliable editing software to remove the green traces in the shot.

**Step 7\. Paste the new background**  
Any background concept can now fit in. Add your desired background video or image in a new layer below the subject. You can continue to make other necessary adjustments like sharpness and hue for reality.

**Step 8\. Add Call To Action**  
Finally, tell your viewers to subscribe to your YouTube channel while watching the video. You can also introduce your other channels that aren't yet known or those that have not reached 1,000 subscribers.

#### 2 Using YouTube Studio

You can also enable the green screen to subscribe via the YouTube Studio. It is a YouTube application that provides you with the tools you need to create a successful YouTube channel. You can manage your videos, respond to comments and even add adverts to your content for pay. Here are the steps to add subscribe button.

**Step 1**. First, go directly to "studio.youtube.com" or click on your profile picture on the YouTube page to launch YT Studio.
