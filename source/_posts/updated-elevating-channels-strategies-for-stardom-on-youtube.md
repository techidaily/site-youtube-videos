**Compatibility:** iOS

ASMRtist is a simple app that doesn’t offer anything else other than a variety of ASMR sounds. There are 36 ASMR sounds to choose from and you can start listening to the sound of crumpling paper or bonfire just by tapping on the corresponding icon. Optionally, you can switch on the shuffle mode and let the app select the ASMR sounds for you automatically.

You can listen to the sounds from the ASMRtist even while your device is in the lock screen mode, which enables you to continue with your daily activities or fall asleep and continue listening to ASMR sounds. The app has a Countdown Timer so that you can choose how long you want to sleep. The app’s dark background contributes to its relaxing and calming capabilities.

### 8\. Super Slime Simulator

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dramaton.slime&hl=en)

If you like playing with slime and hearing the sounds it produces, then you shouldn’t miss out on Super Slime Simulator. The app’s rich slime gallery contains options like metallic, milky, or clear, and you can also create slime simulations on your own. Once you’ve selected the type of slime you want to play with you can start squishing, stretching, or popping it.

All slimes have a different texture and create different 3D sounds when you interact with them. The app also has the Fun Area where you can complete Lu Lu’s Slime quests, turn photos into slime, or even try slime painting. All you need to do in order to undo a stretch is shake your phone and you can continue playing with the slime you selected. Super Slime Simulator offers a unique ASMR experience although you must make in-app purchases in order to enjoy it fully.

### 9\. ASMR Slicing

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crazylabs.asmr.cut&hl=en)

The sound of cutting through sand may be satisfying and trigger the AMSR. This app enables you to cut through different types of objects made from sand. The realistic simulation of the cutting process, the sounds created while cutting through objects make playing this video game incredibly fun.

As you are leveling up, you’re gathering gold and unlocking new objects you can cut which makes the game more fun to play as you progress through it. Playing the ASMR Slicing game is certainly entertaining, as the relaxing sounds you’re making while cutting objects help you get rid of the stress. Even so, the app doesn’t really improve the quality of your sleep or assist you in overcoming anxiety or depression.

### 10\. ASMR Breakfast

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android

Preparing food is in itself a satisfying process that often enables us to forget about the daily troubles. ASMR Breakfast is a video game that simulates the process of preparing breakfast and challenges you to prepare a perfect meal.

The goal is to make a dish without wasting or spilling food, and once you accomplish this task you move onto the next more complicated dish. As you move on through the game you need to purchase interactive elements and in-app products in order to experience it in the full capacity. Moreover, the app displays ads which can spoil the fun and make playing the game less entertaining.

### 11\. Silk ASMR

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

In case you are looking for an app that lets you decide you want to listen to soothing sounds of nature or mix music, voices, and sound on your own, then Silk ASMR is the perfect choice for you. The app features a library of ASMR audio triggers that were created by forty different artists, as well as an impressive collection of binaural beats and tones.

Silk ASMR lets you create an unlimited amount of playlists that include all of your favorite ASMR recordings. In addition, you can download tracks to your device and listen to them while you’re offline. The app also has a Sleep Timer that lets you choose when you want to wake up, while you can also decide how loud or how fast the playback of the audio files you listen is going to be.

**Conclusion**

Having the ability to relax and unwind wherever you are is priceless, and ASMR apps for iOS and Android enable you to do just that. The type of ASMR triggers they offer varies, and you should choose the one that grants you access to the content that can help you triggers ASMR and lessen the stress you’re experiencing.

YouTube features the largest collection of ASMR videos, while apps like Super Slime Simulator or TeasEar let you experience different textures underneath your fingertips. Which of the best ASMR apps for Android and iOS are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.
