##### Note

* If the videos you want to import are already published online, you can start the process by first downloading them directly from YouTube first, making sure to save them as MP4 files.
* The best way of importing videos from YouTube is by using an innovative video converter like Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate. This program will help in downloading and converting files to a format that is supported by Adobe Premier.

#### Step 2: Editing

 The next step in how edit YouTube videos with Adobe Premiere is to start modifying the video files or photos the way you want. To achieve this, click on "Effects Control" and apply the desired effects. If you want to insert some text or words into your video, select "title" and then click "new title." Now choose how you would like the words to behave, for instance, "Default Roll" makes the text roll upwards in the page.

 Now drag the text that you have created into the editor area. If you want to edit the text, simply double-click to select it, and it will bring up a separate page where you can make further edits. You can then modify the text, font, and the positioning as well. This page also allows you to set whether the text will crawl or roll.
