The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.

A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.

However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the **best YouTube Live screen recorders** you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## Top 10+ YouTube Live Screen Recorders

The maximum resolution in which you can [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), audio recording options, or customization of the recording area are some of the most important features you need to consider while choosing a YouTube Live screen recorder.

This means that you can specify the area of the screen you want to record, choose the recording’s resolution and frame rate, or adjust the audio recording options.

OBS Studio is the best free, open-source screen recording program you can download. You shouldn’t use a software just because it’s free, but OBS Studio is also an extremely versatile tool. You can both record and stream in high definition and it comes with the ability to record either through your webcam or through your screen. It records directly through the [graphics card](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which means it can capture games even when in full-screen mode whereas a lot of other screen-recording software forces you to play games in windowed mode. The high quality can be seen easily in whatever you choose to broadcast.

The global pandemic has changed the way we live for the time being, and right now, we cannot attend events in the same way we did at the beginning of the year.

A growing number of cultural organizations, businesses, and influential YouTubers are turning towards YouTube’s Live feature because it provides a simple way of broadcasting different types of content in real-time. YouTube Live is by no means a new option, since the platform first introduced live streaming features in 2008, and some twelve years later, the feature has never been more popular.

However, the live streams you broadcast on YouTube are stored for just a brief period of time, which means you have to search for alternative methods of saving them. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through the **best YouTube Live screen recorders** you can use to capture the video content you are sharing with your followers.

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.
