## What Kind Of News Can You Get on YouTube?

On YouTube, you may find breaking news and popular stories.

#### On the site, there's a shelf for breaking News

Except for viewers under the age of 18, and a Breaking News shelf is shown on the YouTube homepage. The breaking news shelf on the YouTube homepage can be reached simply by scrolling down the YouTube homepage when a major news event occurs. If you're not interested, don't bother. The homepage's breaking news shelf can be turned off.

The information panel provides breaking news context in search results and will only offer text-based samples from a news story. In contrast, the content on the site will incorporate YouTube videos when they are available.

#### In search, the top News shelf

If you search for news, a Top News shelf appears in Search and has relevant information from news sources that follow Google News content policies. Regardless of age, the Top News shelf will appear.

#### Your homepage's top News shelf

If you watch or search for news information, a top news shelf on your homepage may appear. Regardless of age, the top news shelf will appear, with relevant items from news sources that adhere to Google News' content criteria.

#### Your homepage should have a COVID News shelf

On the homepage, a COVID-19 news shelf is now available. On our platform, there are news stories regarding COVID-19 from reliable news providers who respect Google News content policies and local health authorities. On the homepage, you can always hide the COVID-19 News shelf.

## Why Should You Use Youtube as a News Source?

Many people use YouTube to watch funny viral videos and make-up lessons. However, a sizable portion of the American population relies on YouTube for news.

According to a recent Pew Research Center research, YouTube channels are an important source of news and information for more than a quarter of all individuals in the United States. While that's a lot of people turning to YouTube for news, it's not surprising given that the platform is the world's second most-trafficked search engine, directly behind its sister business Google. People use YouTube as a source of information, but they're seeking video rather than text.

#### What Are the Benefits of Youtube News?

What's more surprising is that conventional news media organizations don't account for nearly as much of what consumers consume. According to the report, half of the individuals who get their news via YouTube watch independent channels. And, of those who use YouTube to keep up with current events, 72 percent believe the platform is either an important or the most significant source of information for them. Independent media on YouTube frequently covers situations and topics that the mainstream media may overlook. It's also often complementing, allowing viewers to understand the concerns better.

![youtube news channel - the benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-news-channel-2.png)

According to the Pew study, 66 percent of those who watch YouTube videos for news feel it helps them better comprehend current events. Sixty-eight percent said the videos maintain their attention and that they normally watch them intently rather than playing them in the background. Not only that, but when YouTube news users were asked to explain in their own words why YouTube is a unique place to get news, the most common responses were related to the content itself, such as access to news sources outside of the mainstream and the diversity of opinions and viewpoints available on the platform.
