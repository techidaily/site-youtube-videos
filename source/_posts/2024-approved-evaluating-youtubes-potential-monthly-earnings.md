[Tool you need: YouTube Video Editor](https://www.youtube.com/editor)

YouTube Video Editor is a browser-based video editor released by YouTube itself. It enables users to make minor edits to videos they've uploaded onto YouTube, as well as merge several clips together into one. It requires no additional software, or browser plug-ins (besides Adobe's Flash), which makes it convenient to use. However, it lacks many basic features of modern day consumer video editing software and often crashes while dealing with large video files.

### Step 1.Import YouTube files to the program

Download and install Wondershare Filmora. It gives good support to the downloaded YouTube videos (usually in FLV or MP4 format). You can either click "Import" on the primary windows and select YouTube video files from your computer, or simply drag and drop YouTube video files from File Explorer to the User's Album.

### Step 2. Drag and drop YouTube videos to merge

To merge YouTube videos, select multiple YouTube videos in the User's Album by holding down Ctrl or Shift key, and then drag and drop them to the video track on the Timeline. All YouTube files will join one after another without interrupts and there is none transition by default, but you can add transitions between video clips as you want. This will be introduced in Step 3.

## Part 2: How to Merge YouTube Videos Online

![YouTube Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/import-video-youtube.jpg)

[Tool you need: YouTube Video Editor](https://www.youtube.com/editor)

YouTube Video Editor is a browser-based video editor released by YouTube itself. It enables users to make minor edits to videos they've uploaded onto YouTube, as well as merge several clips together into one. It requires no additional software, or browser plug-ins (besides Adobe's Flash), which makes it convenient to use. However, it lacks many basic features of modern day consumer video editing software and often crashes while dealing with large video files.
