## **Part 2: How to block YouTube ads on the mobile phone (Android & iPhone)**

Ads can cause inconvenience and make YouTube watching a sour experience. To protect yourself from the constant nagging ads on mobile platforms both Android and iPhone you can utilize the numerous ad-blocking apps for Android and iOS. Though the simplest method of blocking the ads and watch YouTube content without ads is to use the Adblock Browser available both for both devices at Google Play Store and Apple Store. This technique won’t require you to root your Android phone or jailbreak the iPhone for watching ad-free YouTube videos.
