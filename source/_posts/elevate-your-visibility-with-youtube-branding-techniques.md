How can you build a personal brand on YouTube that stands out?

YouTube is oversaturated. If you do comedy, fashion, gaming, vlogging, or any other major genre then you are competing with thousands of other channels. In order to grow you need to stand out, and that’s why it’s important to build a strong, clear, brand.

## Your Brand is Your Unique Message

Competing on YouTube is all about offering value. Viewers should be able to find something on your channel that they can’t find anywhere else. This doesn’t mean you need to bend over backwards trying to[invent brand new video ideas that nobody has ever tried before](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-be-original-on-youtube-289.html) – it just means you need to focus on building your unique brand. That is what will make viewers subscribe to you instead of just watching one of your videos and then clicking away.

## The Elevator Pitch

If you had 20 seconds – a short elevator ride – to describe your channel in a way that would make someone want to subscribe, what would you say?

Think about if you were trying to describe your new favorite show to a friend. You wouldn’t stop at saying ‘it’s a comedy’ or ‘it’s about lawyers’ – that doesn’t really tell them anything. You would describe the style of comedy, the personalities of characters you love, and the kinds of plots the show offers.

You need to be able to do that when you talk about your channel.

> What is your style of comedy?
>
> What is your attitude towards fashion?
>
> What will a viewer get out of watching you make pasta that they won’t get from watching someone else make pasta?

Work on developing an elevator pitch for your channel. It will help you define your brand for yourself, and it’ll be useful if you make a channel trailer.

## How to Start Building Your Brand

Building a brand should be intentional. You need to be yourself, but it’s not enough to just ‘be’. You need to create yourself.

  In order to figure out what unique value you’re bringing to YouTube you’ll need to [pay attention to your channel stats](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/understanding-youtube-analytics-%E2%80%93-take-charge-of-your-channel%21-286.html) and comments your viewers make. It can also be a good idea to ask for feedback from friends who you know will be honest with you.

You will notice patterns. There will be things you do in your video that people consistently like more and less. The way you build your brand is by cutting out the stuff that isn’t working and focusing more intentionally on the stuff that is. If people like it when you do meme humor, for example, do more meme humor and make incorporating that in your videos part of your brand.

Banners and thumbnails are also a part of your brand. [More on that here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-youtube-banners-and-thumbnails-316.html).

## Being Consistent

The key to branding is consistency. People need to be able to set expectations.

For every video you do, ask yourself these questions:

> _Who are you?_
>
> _What is your message?_
>
> _What value are you providing?_
>
> _Who is it for?_

The answers to these questions make up your brand. They may change gradually over time – i.e. if you start making videos as a 16 year old, for other 16 year olds, then the ‘Who is it for?’ will change as you and your subscriber base get older – but in general the answers should always be the same. If your ‘message’ is positive and empowering, then it should always be positive and empowering.

When you intentionally create your personal brand on YouTube, you take charge of the message you're sending.

Simply want to [do all the stuff on your phone?](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) check this out.

## Advanced Tips to Edit Uploaded/ Published YouTube Videos

It is true that YouTube Editor provides us a handy platform that allows us to edit existing YouTube videos in an efficient ways. However, the tools they provide are too basic. If you want to perform a more complex editing, you will need an offline editor such as Windows Movie Maker, iMovei or Adobe Premiere. But if you are looking for an simple while powerful tool, we highly recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is highly compatible with different image, audio, and video format. It is just as simple as importing the video and editing them.

The **downside**, however, is that you will lose the original ID of the video. This may serve as a problem if you have already shared the video before since the views may disappear. A good solution to this problem is to place an annotation to the old video telling your followers that you have created a better quality of the video then direct them to the link.

## Edit Existing YouTube Videos

Let me walk you through a familiar situation, you spend all night trying to make your video perfect, uploaded it on your YouTube channel and shred it to your social media accounts. Then you noticed that you need to repair something. The normal approach back then is to delete the video, re-edit using offline tools and then re-upload it again. Clearly, this process takes too much time. Furthermore, it changes the ID of your video which means that the previous embed will no longer work.

**Note:** Under this situation, you can't add more footage or effects to the existing videos.

#### 1\. Sigin in

The first thing you need to do to edit uploaded/published YouTube videos is to sign-in with your Google account.

## Advanced Tips to Edit Uploaded/ Published YouTube Videos

It is true that YouTube Editor provides us a handy platform that allows us to edit existing YouTube videos in an efficient ways. However, the tools they provide are too basic. If you want to perform a more complex editing, you will need an offline editor such as Windows Movie Maker, iMovei or Adobe Premiere. But if you are looking for an simple while powerful tool, we highly recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is highly compatible with different image, audio, and video format. It is just as simple as importing the video and editing them.

The **downside**, however, is that you will lose the original ID of the video. This may serve as a problem if you have already shared the video before since the views may disappear.
