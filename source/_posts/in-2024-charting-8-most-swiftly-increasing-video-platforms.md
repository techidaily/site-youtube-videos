2. **Optimize watch time.**  
YouTube also factors in the watch time, both for SEO results and promotional purposes. Videos with a high watch time are likely to be promoted on the YouTube homepage. You can use lots of patterns interrupts to keep people watching or include graphics to help them focus more.
3. **Embed your videos into blog posts.**  
Blogs are a great way to tell your viewers what your product brings to the table. If you can get someone to read your post, then it shows they like your stuff. So, embed your video and let them learn via detailed steps, and they'll probably subscribe to your channel.
4. **Add a brand watermark.**

Your video is your voice when it comes to promoting your channel. Ensure you give people quality videos with a piece of detailed advice that works for them.
