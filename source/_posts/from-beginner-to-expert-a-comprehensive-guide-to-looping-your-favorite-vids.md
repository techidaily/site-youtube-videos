It has only been ten years since Opera, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox announced the native support for the WebM file format. This open-source audiovisual media file format was developed as a result of Google’s initiative and it is currently available under a BSD-style license.

WebM can be used free of charge in HTLM 5 video and audio elements, while its wrapper format is based on a Matroska profile. This file format is designed primarily for use on the web, since traditional video file formats may not play smoothly on all playback devices.

The low computational demands of WebM files ensure that a video saved in this format can be played even on playback devices that have limited processing capabilities. Moreover, WebM is perfectly suited for streaming purposes, since it maintains high picture quality while reducing the size of the video that is being broadcasted.

## Part 4: The Advantages of Converting YouTube Videos to WebM File Format

The demand for video content has never been larger, as Internet users prefer this type of content to all other types of content that are available online. Converting a YouTube video to WebM will make it easier to embed it on a website or view on devices that don’t have a lot of computational power.

Optimizing all video content you post online for the devices from which they are going to be viewed will increase their reach. MP4 video files can sometimes be too large to post on social media, while WebM files maintain the same image quality at significantly lower file sizes.

WebM video files are created for online use and they are compatible with nearly all web browsers for PC computers which makes them a great option for anyone who wants to create video content on a constant basis. However, finding a media player for Windows OS that supports this video file format can prove to be a challenging task.

**Conclusion**

Converting a YouTube video to a WebM file format doesn’t require a lot of time or effort, because most online platforms or apps for Mac and PC computers make this process automatic. Even so, the amount of available file conversion tools is the best way to determine if a platform you’re considering is the right choice for you. Do you convert YouTube videos to WebM file format often? Leave a comment and share your opinion with us.

The low computational demands of WebM files ensure that a video saved in this format can be played even on playback devices that have limited processing capabilities. Moreover, WebM is perfectly suited for streaming purposes, since it maintains high picture quality while reducing the size of the video that is being broadcasted.

## Part 4: The Advantages of Converting YouTube Videos to WebM File Format

The demand for video content has never been larger, as Internet users prefer this type of content to all other types of content that are available online. Converting a YouTube video to WebM will make it easier to embed it on a website or view on devices that don’t have a lot of computational power.

Optimizing all video content you post online for the devices from which they are going to be viewed will increase their reach. MP4 video files can sometimes be too large to post on social media, while WebM files maintain the same image quality at significantly lower file sizes.

WebM video files are created for online use and they are compatible with nearly all web browsers for PC computers which makes them a great option for anyone who wants to create video content on a constant basis. However, finding a media player for Windows OS that supports this video file format can prove to be a challenging task.

**Conclusion**

Converting a YouTube video to a WebM file format doesn’t require a lot of time or effort, because most online platforms or apps for Mac and PC computers make this process automatic. Even so, the amount of available file conversion tools is the best way to determine if a platform you’re considering is the right choice for you.
