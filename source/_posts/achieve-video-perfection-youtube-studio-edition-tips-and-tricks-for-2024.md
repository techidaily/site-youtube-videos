Sometimes, we are interested to play our favorite music during a long hour journey, but the missing internet connectivity does not allow us to stream it online. In such a situation also, you can get your free music easily on your iPad, iPhone, or any handheld device and it can be later burnt into CD as well. Now you might be interested to know how all this can happen without the ‚ÄúRecord Audio‚Äù button on YouTube. Don‚Äôt worry! Below we have highlighted three simple methods to do this task:
