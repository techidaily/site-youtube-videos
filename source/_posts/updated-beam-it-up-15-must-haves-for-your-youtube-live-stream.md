Broadcasting videos in real time on social media can be a great way to share some of the best moments of your life with your friends or to reach new customers for the products your company offers. YouTube is the world's biggest video sharing platform that already allows its users to stream live videos through third-party applications such as Wirecast Play or OBS. Less than a month ago, YouTube has finally made possible live streaming directly from a computer's webcam. The option is currently only available on Chrome browsers, but the company claims that more browsers will start offering this feature soon.

In this article, we are going to provide you with all the information you'll need to create seamless live streams using a webcam and introduce you to some of the best webcam models in 2021.

## Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021

The quality of the video recording you intend to broadcast live is essential for the success of your live streams. Most built-in laptop webcams produce low-quality videos, and for that reason using an external webcam that captures high-resolution videos can help you create live streams that attract a lot of attention from YouTube's community.

### How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?

**Compatability:** Even the best webcams on the market are completely useless if they are not compatible with your computer. Finding a webcam that works with a PC or a Mac shouldn't be too difficult because both Windows and iOS platforms offer support for a wide range of models.

**Video Resolution:** YouTubers that just want to produce simple live streams don't have to pay a lot of attention to the video resolution, because their videos don't show too many details. Vloggers and gamers, on the other hand, should consider using webcams that produce 4K or HD footage since lower-priced options have a hard time realistically depicting colors. The quality of the video output a webcam produces can increase its price significantly, so there's no reason investing in it if you don't have the intention of utilizing its features to the fullest.

**Sound Quality:** Besides the video features, you should also look into the webcam's audio options, because no one wants to watch a video with a terrible sound. Buying an external microphone is probably the best solution to this issue, but if you can't afford one, then purchasing a webcam with decent audio recording features is the second best option.

**Adjustable Location:** Although the angle from which you are recording a stream may not seem important, poorly framed live streams are more likely to go unnoticed. A webcam that is easily adjustable can grant you the freedom of choosing your shots on every live stream you share online and it will enable you to control each and every detail in the video.

## How to live stream from a webcam on YouTube in 2020

Although producing your own live stream on YouTube is easy, there are still a few steps you will have to take before you can start streaming from the webcam on your computer. If you don't have a YouTube channel, you must make one, in order to be able to create your first live steam.

#### Step 1

Go to [youtube.com/webcam](https://www.youtube.com/webcam), then complete the channel verification process and make sure that your channel doesn't have any live streaming restrictions in the last 90 days. Head over to your channel, click on the Create a Video or Post icon in the upper right corner of the web page and select the GoLive option.

Afterward, you should give Chrome permission to access your webcam and the microphone you intend on using to record audio.

#### Step 2

Immediately after, the platform will ask you to give a title to your stream and it will let you choose whether or not you want the stream to be public or unlisted. It may be a good idea to create a few unlisted streams before you go public if you are still trying to figure out how this feature works.

![youtube-livestream-settings.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-livestream-settings.jpg)

Proceed to select the camera and the microphone you intend to use to record the live stream, and you can also click on the Advanced Settings icon if you want to disable chat during the session or to specify that the live stream includes paid promotions.

#### Step 3

Once you've finished fine-tuning the advanced settings, you should click on the Next button. The platform will offer you to take or upload a thumbnail for your live stream.

![youtube-livestream-preview.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-livestream-preview.jpg)

Clicking on the Share icon will enable you to share a live stream on social media, copy the link or access the embed code. Using the Share option is a great way to check if your live stream is functioning properly and to make sure that you are all set to begin the streaming session.

#### Step 4

Start your live stream by hitting the Go Live button. During the stream, you'll be able to see and reply to comments people posted, the duration of the stream as well as the number of people following your live stream. If you haven't shared your live stream before you started a new session you can do so while you are live. Click on the End Stream button to finish your webcam live stream on YouTube.

#### Step 5

After each live streaming session, YouTube will display some important statistics like the total and average watch time for the particular stream, the number of new subscribers or the number of playbacks of your live stream. The stream will be available for review in YouTube's Creator Studio in the Events menu.

## How to live stream from a webcam on YouTube in 2020

Although producing your own live stream on YouTube is easy, there are still a few steps you will have to take before you can start streaming from the webcam on your computer. If you don't have a YouTube channel, you must make one, in order to be able to create your first live steam.

#### Step 1

Go to [youtube.com/webcam](https://www.youtube.com/webcam), then complete the channel verification process and make sure that your channel doesn't have any live streaming restrictions in the last 90 days. Head over to your channel, click on the Create a Video or Post icon in the upper right corner of the web page and select the GoLive option.

Afterward, you should give Chrome permission to access your webcam and the microphone you intend on using to record audio.

#### Step 2

Immediately after, the platform will ask you to give a title to your stream and it will let you choose whether or not you want the stream to be public or unlisted. It may be a good idea to create a few unlisted streams before you go public if you are still trying to figure out how this feature works.

Proceed to select the camera and the microphone you intend to use to record the live stream, and you can also click on the Advanced Settings icon if you want to disable chat during the session or to specify that the live stream includes paid promotions.

![youtube-livestream-preview.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-livestream-preview.jpg)

During the stream, you'll be able to see and reply to comments people posted, the duration of the stream as well as the number of people following your live stream.

#### Step 5

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Broadcasting videos in real time on social media can be a great way to share some of the best moments of your life with your friends or to reach new customers for the products your company offers. YouTube is the world's biggest video sharing platform that already allows its users to stream live videos through third-party applications such as Wirecast Play or OBS. Less than a month ago, YouTube has finally made possible live streaming directly from a computer's webcam. The option is currently only available on Chrome browsers, but the company claims that more browsers will start offering this feature soon.

In this article, we are going to provide you with all the information you'll need to create seamless live streams using a webcam and introduce you to some of the best webcam models in 2021.

## Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021

The quality of the video recording you intend to broadcast live is essential for the success of your live streams. Most built-in laptop webcams produce low-quality videos, and for that reason using an external webcam that captures high-resolution videos can help you create live streams that attract a lot of attention from YouTube's community.

### How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?

**Compatability:** Even the best webcams on the market are completely useless if they are not compatible with your computer. Finding a webcam that works with a PC or a Mac shouldn't be too difficult because both Windows and iOS platforms offer support for a wide range of models.

**Video Resolution:** YouTubers that just want to produce simple live streams don't have to pay a lot of attention to the video resolution, because their videos don't show too many details. Vloggers and gamers, on the other hand, should consider using webcams that produce 4K or HD footage since lower-priced options have a hard time realistically depicting colors. The quality of the video output a webcam produces can increase its price significantly, so there's no reason investing in it if you don't have the intention of utilizing its features to the fullest.

**Sound Quality:** Besides the video features, you should also look into the webcam's audio options, because no one wants to watch a video with a terrible sound. Buying an external microphone is probably the best solution to this issue, but if you can't afford one, then purchasing a webcam with decent audio recording features is the second best option.

**Adjustable Location:** Although the angle from which you are recording a stream may not seem important, poorly framed live streams are more likely to go unnoticed. A webcam that is easily adjustable can grant you the freedom of choosing your shots on every live stream you share online and it will enable you to control each and every detail in the video.

![ Logitech 4K Pro Webcam ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-4k-pro-webcam.jpg)

**OS:** Windows, macOS, Chrome OS

**Price:** $199

This is currently the only webcam on the market that supports 4K video recording, which makes it a forerunner of innovation and change.

The webcam can perform basic functions, like Skype calls, without the aid of third-party apps, which means that you can use it to create live streams on YouTube even if you don't have a broadcasting software. The webcam's stand is designed to fit almost any surface, so mounting the Logitech 4K Pro webcam to a laptop or monitor is quick and simple. The background replacement feature this Logitech's webcam model offers can be quite useful if you want to use a different background in your YouTube live stream.
