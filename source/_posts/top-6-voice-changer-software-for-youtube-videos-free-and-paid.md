![voice changer AthTek](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-AthTek.JPG)

AthTek’s free voice changer for Windows is a very simple program that will allow you to change the pitch and speed of your voice in an audio recording. It does not work in real-time unless you purchase the $15 ‘all in one version. Usually, as a YouTuber, you will be working with pre-recorded audio, though.

#### 2\. Audacity – Free

Audacity is not specifically a voice changer; it is a full-feature audio editing program for Mac or PC. If your goal is only to use a false voice then Audacity might be more complicated than you want as you will have to make all your changes manually. There are no pre-set voices, but you can change both the pitch and tempo of your audio recordings and do a lot of other detailed editings. You can record audio using Audacity, or import audio files to edit. Audacity is available at Audacityteam.org.

#### 3\. Voxal Voice Changer – Free

![voice changer Voxal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-Voxal.JPG)

There are a lot of different preset voices to choose from and you can also create and save your own settings for re-use. The price of Voxal Voice Changer is different depending on how you want to use it. There are no restrictions on the free version of this software, but there are also paid versions that cost $13 or $15 depending on whether you will be using it commercially.
