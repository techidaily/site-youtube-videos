### Step 2: Select and Add Audio/Sound Effect to YouTube Intro

## Part 1: How to Make a YouTube Intro Video with Filmora

With Wondershare Filmora, you can create your custom intros from scratch, i.e., even if you don’t have an existing image or footage to start with. You can follow the method given below to learn **how to make YouTube intro** with Filmora:

### Step 1: Add Intro Background to Filmora

Launch Wondershare Filmora, go to **Media** tab at the top, select the **Sample Colors** category from the left pane.
