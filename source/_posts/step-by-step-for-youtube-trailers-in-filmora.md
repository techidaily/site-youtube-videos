### Method 7: Try YouTube Vanced

Wait, the list is not over yet. If none of the previous methods work, try **YouTube Vanced**, the advanced and premium version of YouTube to get rid of YouTube Shorts. Well, not only that, but YouTube Vanced also comes up with multiple services that you can enjoy along with it, such as disabling YouTube Shorts, blocking ads, stories, or any of the sponsored features.

If not sure how to go about it, then let’s have a look over the following steps that will guide you to get YouTube Vanced.

**Step 1: Download YouTube Vanced**

First, download the YouTube Vanced application from its website.

**Step 2: Install and complete the setup process**

After that, complete the installation process and follow the on-screen direction rightly to make it work effectively for you.

**Note:** If you are downloading from the website, not from the app store, then there might appear the warning. So ignore that and go with the downloading and installation process.

**Step 3: Open application and visit settings**

Once you have launched the application, under the settings, you need to go for the **Vanced settings** option> there opt for "Ad settings" > at the end of the page, switch on the **Shorts shelf**.

Doing so will disable the YouTube Shorts option from the **Home** screen.

Alternatively, remove the **YouTube Shorts** button also from the screen. Under the “Vanced settings” > Visit **Layout settings** \> Switch on the **Comments location** option. That will further remove the Shorts button from the bottom end of the Home screen of the YouTube page.
