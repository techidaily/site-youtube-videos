## Easy & Speed: Share YouTube Playlists Now

YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.

But what if you've created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we've put together an extensive guide on **how to** **share a YouTube playlist** on your computer and mobile devices.

So, let's get started with our guide without any further delay!

## Why Doesn't The Share Function In The Playlist Work?

Firstly, let's figure out why the "Share" function doesn't work. The "Share" function in the playlist does not work because it is set to "private," and YouTube doesn't allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to "public" in the following way:

Step1 Head to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.

Step2

* **Click** the three-line **"Menu"** icon at the top-left of your screen.
* Go to **"Library."**
* Scroll down to the **"Playlist"** section.

Step3 Select your playlist labeled as **"Private."** On the next page, click the **"Private"** option in the playlist details section and select **"Public"** to change the visibility of your playlist.

Once the privacy setting has been changed, the **"share"** function will work as intended.

## How To Share The YouTube Playlist?

If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:

### 1\. For Computers

Here are four different ways to share your YouTube playlist using your laptop or desktop computer:

##### How To Share Your Own YouTube Playlist With A Link To View?

Sharing your YouTube playlist is a perfect way to increase the number of views and subscribers, allowing your viewers to see all the videos in one place.

This is especially helpful if you have a series of videos that you want viewers to watch. Here are the step-by-step instructions for achieving this task:

Step1 Visit the **YouTube website** using a browser on your computer and sign in to your account. Click your **Profile** in the top-right of the screen and select **"Your Channel"** from the drop-down menu, which will take you to your YouTube channel's dashboard.

![accessing youtube channel to share playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-youtube-channel-to-share-playlist.png)

Step2 Next, go to the **"Playlist"** tab and click the **"View Full Playlist"** option under your playlist to access it.

![sharing own youtube playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/sharing-own-youtube-playlist.png)

Step3 Finally, click the **"Share"** icon in the playlist's details section, and a window will pop up. From here, you can either click **"Copy"** to save the link to your clipboard or share the playlist directly to WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Email, KakaoTalk, Reddit, and more platforms.

##### How To Share Someone Else's YouTube Playlist With A Link To View?

If you want to share someone else's YouTube playlist with a link, do the following steps in sequence:

Step1 In the first step, launch your preferred browser, visit the **YouTube** website, and sign in to your account using your credentials.

Step2 On the left side of the website's main interface, click the **"Library"** option and scroll down to the **Playlists** section.

![sharing others youtube playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/sharing-others-youtube-playlist.png)

Step3 Under the **"Playlists"** section, click on the playlist you want to share. Now, click the **"Share"** icon in the playlist's details section, and a pop-up window will appear. In the **"Share"** section, copy the URL and paste it into an email, message, or social media post to share.

That's all there is to it! Anyone you've shared the link with can watch the entire playlist.

##### How To Share The Playlist While Watching?

We all love using YouTube for research or just scrolling through videos to pass the time, and we often share our favorite videos with others. What if you wish to share a whole YouTube playlist while watching it?

Fortunately, there's a simple and quick way to do this, and here are the step-by-step instructions for this method.

Step1 In the first step, head to the **YouTube** website using a browser and use the search bar to access the playlist.

![sharing youtube playlist while watching](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/sharing-youtube-playlist-while-watching.png)

Step2 Click the playlist to start watching it. Next, click the **playlist title** in the grey box on the right-hand side.

Step3 On the playlist page, click the **"Share"** icon in the details section, and a window will pop-up. Click **"Copy"** to save the link or directly share the playlist to social platforms.

That's it! The recipient will now be able to watch the entire YouTube playlist you've shared.

##### How To Share A YouTube Playlist With A Link To Collaborate

Through the "Collaborate on playlists" feature, YouTube allows you to add friends to your playlist, who can then add videos to it.

Here's how you can share a YouTube playlist with a link to collaborate with your friends:

Step1 In the first step, go to the **YouTube** website using your preferred browser, and sign in to your channel's [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/mail/) account using your email address and password.

Step2 Click your **"Profile"** icon, choose the **"Your Channel"** option from the drop-down menu and go to the **"Playlist."**

Step3 In the next step, click the **"View Full Playlist"** option under your preferred playlist. This will take you to your playlist page.

Step4 In the details section of your YouTube playlist on the playlist page, click the **three dots (ellipsis)** icon and select the **"Collaborate"** option.

![sharing youtube playlist link to collaborate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/sharing-youtube-playlist-link-to-collaborate.png)

Step5 A pop-up window will appear on your screen. Toggle on the **"Collaborators can add videos to this playlist"** option to enable it, and the **"Allow new collaborators"** option will appear.

Toggle on the **"Allow new collaborators"** option, click **"Copy"** to save the URL to your clipboard, and click **"Done"** to apply the changes.

![allowing collaboration on youtube playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/allowing-collaboration-on-youtube-playlist.png)

That's about it! You can now share the playlist link with your friends, who can now add videos to it.

### 2\. For iOS and Android
