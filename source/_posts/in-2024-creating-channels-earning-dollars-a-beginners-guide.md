By clicking on ‘import,’ you can access the folder to browse the videos you need.

This software gives easy access to videos necessary for the edit and helps you manage them later during the edit. All the files are in the album shown in the left tray, and the ones needed can be displayed in the right window by double-clicking them.

![import files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-5.jpg)

##### Step2 Insert the video in timelines

To insert a video in the timeline section, drag and drop the files from the media library that will serve as the background video in the first track, then drag and drop another video that you want to add on top of the background video in the second track.

![insert the video in timelines](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-6.jpg)

##### Step3 Alter Speed and Duration Settings

You may alter the duration of the video using the Speed and Duration Settings.

Similarly, if you want to add more than one video together, you can carry out the same process on multiple tracks to share the same frame.

![speed and duration settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Adjust the size and positioning of the video

You can also access the editing interface to adjust the position of the video on top. Simply drag the sliders on the interface to change the size, direction and position of the video.

![adjust the position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-8.jpg)

##### Step5 Advance editing

Some advanced editing can also be done to make the video more impressive. Double-click the video to open the editing panel. You can carry out multiple tasks like

1\. Applying motion effects

4\. Play with the audio.

![play with the audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-12.jpg)

Filmora also has the feature of applying masks to the video; these come in different shapes and positions and can be adjusted accordingly.

![video mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-13.jpg)

##### Step6 Add effects, stock video, elements, and transitions from Filmora's vast library

Filmora has additional features like stock photos and video footage that can be added to enhance the beauty of the video content.

**Effects:**

Go to the top menu and click on effects; you can find many of them; they are categorized in the left vertical menu.

![filmora effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-14.jpg)

**Stock Videos:**

Go to the official site of [Filmora video stocks](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/). There are a large number of video templates, stock videos, images, and audio files.

You can also access the stock videos from Pixels, Giphy, Pixabay, and Unsplash without leaving the Filmora Software. Go to the Stock Media section in the top menu to access these.

Now you can easily find content to make your videos attractive.

![filmora stock media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-15.jpg)

**Elements:**

Filmora has an extensive stock of Elements; with the proper use of Elements in YouTube videos, you can make them engaging and interactive. You already know the importance of interactive videos.

Find multiple elements from the Element section beside the effects and transition section in Filmora.

![filmora elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-16.jpg)

**Transition:**

Transition smoothens the video, especially when various clips are combined. Use transitions from the Filmora Transition section and set the stage for the next scene, convey the mood and smoothen your YouTube video.

![filmora transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-17.jpg)

The presence of this library reduces the labor of finding images on the internet, makes them accessible to the user, and makes the video interesting.

##### Step7 Export and save the video

The video is saved by simply clicking ‘ Export.’ You can always share the video online or offline, either publish directly on social media or save it on your computer for later upload.

![export video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-money-does-mr.-beast-make-18.jpg)

The quality content that you obtain from Filmora can now be used to inspire millions of viewers out there. You are just an upload away!

## Final Words

YouTube has made careers of a lot of people under the banner of creative video content that could otherwise go unnoticed.

No doubt, Mr. Beast has become a leading artist on this platform and made a tremendous amount of money through it, which inspires billions of people what they can achieve with a little creativity and loads of passion!
