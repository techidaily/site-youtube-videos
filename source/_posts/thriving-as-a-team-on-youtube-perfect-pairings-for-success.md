## Tips From Tech YouTuber Roberto Blake

**[Roberto Blake](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCovtFObhY9NypXcyHxAS7-Q)** is a YouTuber who does tech reviews and graphic design tutorials in addition to providing great information about being a creative entrepreneur. He has done several collab videos and has a lot of advice about how to find potential partners. Here are 3 of his biggest tips:

#### 1\. Approach people you already have a relationship with

This could mean friends, people you have met at events like VidCon, or people who are subscribed to your channel. It is easier for someone to want to collaborate with you if they feel like they know you.

#### **2\. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers.**

People sub to Roberto for tech advice, for example, so it makes sense for him to collaborate with people who have insights into technology. Collaborations should never be all about bringing in new subs – make your videos for the people who already watch your channel.

#### **3\. Create quality content consistently.**

If you approach somebody about collaborating and they see that you haven’t posted in over a month, or that you don’t have many videos, it might be harder to get them to agree to work with you. The same goes if they watch your videos and don’t think they are at the same quality level as their videos.

## Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin

This is a collab video about collab videos! **[Nick Nimmin’s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCei6wyubYC1I1FwZ54LZFiA)** channel is all about YouTube, and Brandon’s channel **[OnePercentBetter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI6t05DNVlV0XhdI7hx%5Fiw)** has tons of cool self-development animations. It’s Brandon giving the tips in this video, and 3 of his best are:

#### **1\. Use the person’s name when you contact them.**

This might seem obvious, but it is an easy mistake to make. If you send someone an email where you don’t use their name (maybe you just say ‘hey’) it will seem like you aren’t interested in them. Talking about a video of theirs you like can also help show your interest in them as a creator.

#### **2\. Keep it simple.**

When you’re approaching someone for the first time, don’t overwhelm them with a long email. Limit yourself to around two paragraphs.

#### **3\. Have ideas.**

Don’t make your potential partner do the work of pitching ideas to you. Be open to their ideas, but come up with 1 or 2 ideas of your own you can mention when you approach the creator you want to work with. People will be more likely to say ‘yes’ to a specific idea than to the idea of collaborating in general, if they don’t already know you.

## Tips From Freelancer / Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer

**[Amy Schmittauer](https://www.youtube.com/user/savvysexysocial/featured)** of Savvy Sexy Social does vlogs, lifestyle videos, and provides tips on being a freelancer. After doing several collabs in one week, she posted this video about how collaborations work best and how you should approach people you might want to work with.

#### **1\.** **Networking is important in finding collab partners.**

Be nice to other creators when you meet them, offline or online, and build real relationships. Amy got to collaborate with **[Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee)** (MKBHD) even though she had not met him before because **[Austin Evans](https://www.youtube.com/user/duncan33303)** \- who she had built a friendship with – vouched for her with him. When you are networking, think beyond what the immediate payoff could be.

#### **2\. Don’t stray too far from your other content.**

Aim to make your collab videos similar, content-wise, to the other videos on your channel. That way the new viewers you get from having the guest YouTuber in your video will be able to make an informed decision about whether they want to subscribe to you.

#### **3\. Thank the people you work with in your videos.**

If you appeared in someone else’s video, you would probably appreciate it if they thanked you for being there, told their viewers to go check out your channel, and provided a link for them to do so. So, when you host someone else in one of your videos, that’s the kind of treatment you should give them. If you don’t, then the next person you want to collaborate with will see that and probably won’t want to work with you.

 _Collab advice starts at around 2:10._

## Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva

**[Eva Gutowski](https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeaseva/featured)** (MyLifeAsEva) is a lifestyle, fashion, and DIY YouTuber who has done numerous collaborations and believes in making real friends on YouTube. In the video above she shares some of her experiences and talks about how to come across as a real person when you approach other YouTubers about collaborating.

#### **1\. Don’t approach other YouTubers as a ‘fan’.**

If you want to be friends and collab partners, talk to other YouTubers as if you are their equal (which you are!). If you want to work with someone it’s probably because you like their videos, and there’s nothing wrong with saying so. Being all ‘omg, I love you, please subscribe to me too!’ isn’t likely to lead to a collab, though.

#### **2\. Ask questions.**

If you’re just trying to break the ice with someone, it is a good idea to as them a question – potentially about YouTube or one of their videos. This will give them something to engage with, and it’s also a good way to let them know you’re a YouTuber too.

#### **3\. Use Twitter.**

Twitter is the best place to make YouTube friends, in Eva’s opinion. It’s an easy place to casually introduce yourself and ask questions.

 Do you have any of your advice on YouTube collaborations?

## Tips From Freelancer / Lifestyle Vlogger Amy Schmittauer

**[Amy Schmittauer](https://www.youtube.com/user/savvysexysocial/featured)** of Savvy Sexy Social does vlogs, lifestyle videos, and provides tips on being a freelancer. After doing several collabs in one week, she posted this video about how collaborations work best and how you should approach people you might want to work with.

#### **1\.** **Networking is important in finding collab partners.**

Be nice to other creators when you meet them, offline or online, and build real relationships. Amy got to collaborate with **[Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee)** (MKBHD) even though she had not met him before because **[Austin Evans](https://www.youtube.com/user/duncan33303)** \- who she had built a friendship with – vouched for her with him. When you are networking, think beyond what the immediate payoff could be.

#### **2\. Don’t stray too far from your other content.**

Aim to make your collab videos similar, content-wise, to the other videos on your channel. That way the new viewers you get from having the guest YouTuber in your video will be able to make an informed decision about whether they want to subscribe to you.

#### **3\. Thank the people you work with in your videos.**

If you appeared in someone else’s video, you would probably appreciate it if they thanked you for being there, told their viewers to go check out your channel, and provided a link for them to do so. So, when you host someone else in one of your videos, that’s the kind of treatment you should give them. If you don’t, then the next person you want to collaborate with will see that and probably won’t want to work with you.

 _Collab advice starts at around 2:10._

## Tips From Lifestyle and Fashion YouTuber MyLifeAsEva

**[Eva Gutowski](https://www.youtube.com/user/mylifeaseva/featured)** (MyLifeAsEva) is a lifestyle, fashion, and DIY YouTuber who has done numerous collaborations and believes in making real friends on YouTube. In the video above she shares some of her experiences and talks about how to come across as a real person when you approach other YouTubers about collaborating.

#### **1\. Don’t approach other YouTubers as a ‘fan’.**

If you want to be friends and collab partners, talk to other YouTubers as if you are their equal (which you are!). If you want to work with someone it’s probably because you like their videos, and there’s nothing wrong with saying so. Being all ‘omg, I love you, please subscribe to me too!’ isn’t likely to lead to a collab, though.

#### **2\. Ask questions.**

If you’re just trying to break the ice with someone, it is a good idea to as them a question – potentially about YouTube or one of their videos. This will give them something to engage with, and it’s also a good way to let them know you’re a YouTuber too.

#### **3\. Use Twitter.**

Twitter is the best place to make YouTube friends, in Eva’s opinion. It’s an easy place to casually introduce yourself and ask questions.

 Do you have any of your advice on YouTube collaborations?

## Tips From Tech YouTuber Roberto Blake

**[Roberto Blake](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCovtFObhY9NypXcyHxAS7-Q)** is a YouTuber who does tech reviews and graphic design tutorials in addition to providing great information about being a creative entrepreneur. He has done several collab videos and has a lot of advice about how to find potential partners. Here are 3 of his biggest tips:

#### 1\. Approach people you already have a relationship with

This could mean friends, people you have met at events like VidCon, or people who are subscribed to your channel. It is easier for someone to want to collaborate with you if they feel like they know you.

#### **2\. Think about what your potential partner could have to offer your existing subscribers.**

People sub to Roberto for tech advice, for example, so it makes sense for him to collaborate with people who have insights into technology. Collaborations should never be all about bringing in new subs – make your videos for the people who already watch your channel.

#### **3\. Create quality content consistently.**

If you approach somebody about collaborating and they see that you haven’t posted in over a month, or that you don’t have many videos, it might be harder to get them to agree to work with you. The same goes if they watch your videos and don’t think they are at the same quality level as their videos.

## Tips From YouTube Guru Nich Nimmin

This is a collab video about collab videos! **[Nick Nimmin’s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCei6wyubYC1I1FwZ54LZFiA)** channel is all about YouTube, and Brandon’s channel **[OnePercentBetter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRI6t05DNVlV0XhdI7hx%5Fiw)** has tons of cool self-development animations. It’s Brandon giving the tips in this video, and 3 of his best are:

#### **1\. Use the person’s name when you contact them.**

This might seem obvious, but it is an easy mistake to make. If you send someone an email where you don’t use their name (maybe you just say ‘hey’) it will seem like you aren’t interested in them. Talking about a video of theirs you like can also help show your interest in them as a creator.

#### **2\. Keep it simple.**

When you’re approaching someone for the first time, don’t overwhelm them with a long email. Limit yourself to around two paragraphs.

#### **3\. Have ideas.**

Don’t make your potential partner do the work of pitching ideas to you. Be open to their ideas, but come up with 1 or 2 ideas of your own you can mention when you approach the creator you want to work with. People will be more likely to say ‘yes’ to a specific idea than to the idea of collaborating in general, if they don’t already know you.

## Accelerate Audience Engagement with High-Impact Hash Tags

Youtube hashtags have the power to get more viewers to your channel. Choosing the right ones at the right moment will help you grow much faster.

Knowing this, how do you know the perfect hashtags for YouTube?

The answer is simple. This guide lets you know precisely how to discover the best hashtags for YouTube. In addition, you'll learn what tools to use and how to always find the correct tag for each video.

1. [Keyword Tool](#)
2. [TubeBuddy Chrome Extension](#)
3. [VidIQ Chrome Extension](#)

* [Bonus: Edit Your Vlog Videos Like A Pro With Filmora](#part3)

## Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags

Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.

If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.

This is a list that might help:

* #vloggingmylife
* #vlogginggear
* #vloggerlife
* #vloggers
* #vloglife
* #vlogger
* #vlogging
* #youtuber
* #vlogs
* #dailyvlog
* #vloggingcamera
* #vloging
* #vloggingcommunity
* #vloggerlifestyle
* #travelvlogging
* #vloggingmum
* #foodvlogging
* #vlogginglife
* #newtovlogging
* #disneyvlogging
* #vlogging101
* #vloggingsetup
* #vloggingfamily
* #vlogday
* #kidsvlogging
* #imvlogginghere
* #beautyvlogging
* #microvlogging
* #motovlogging
* #instavlogging

When using hashtags for YouTube, it's essential to put yourself in your viewers' shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.

For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.

This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.

## Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags

You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed. But sometimes, you will need better or more appropriate ones.

The best way to always have the perfect tags is to use a YouTube hashtags generator. It's a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.

Here are the three best YouTube hashtag generators you can use:

### 1 [Keyword Tool](https://keywordtool.io/youtube)

This tool's primary purpose may be to help with keyword research, but it has a valuable hashtag extension.

First, type in the topic of your video. For example, "vlog." Hit Search.

![youtube hashtag generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg)

Then, select the Hashtags panel.

![youtube hashtag tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg)

This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.

![list of tags for youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-hashtags.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
That's all there is to it. Copy any tags you like and use them for your video. Also, you can purchase the pro version of this tool to get more detailed insights. However, the free version works just fine most of the time. The choice is yours.

### 2 [TubeBuddy Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubebuddy/mhkhmbddkmdggbhaaaodilponhnccicb)

![tubebuddy chrome extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/tubebuddy.jpg)

TubeBuddy is a Chrome extension that does much more for your YouTube channel than help with hashtags. It's an optimization tool that will configure everything for better reach.

It's also available as an Android and iOS app. As for the Chrome extension, you install it, and it integrates with YouTube.

The next time you upload a video, it will analyze it and help you process and publish it more quickly.

Additionally, TubeBuddy will also show you the best possible hashtags to use for your unique video. Over 1 million people use it. That should be proof enough that this tool truly offers something valuable.

### 3 [VidIQ Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vidiq-vision-for-youtube/pachckjkecffpdphbpmfolblodfkgbhl?hl=en)

![vidlq chrome extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/vidlq.jpg)

This is another Chrome extension that helps you find keywords and YouTube tags to get more views. It's just as easy to use as the previous one. VidLQ has over 2 million users worldwide, proving its usefulness.

Plus, it has plenty of other features to help you grow your channel. For example, its Competitors Tool will give you insights into what similar channels are doing. VidLQ will also help you optimize your videos to get recommended to more viewers. As we all know, this can significantly increase your views.

It's a great tool that can be especially beneficial for beginners. However, because of its simplicity, anyone starting on Youtube should use it. It does most of the publishing for you but teaches you how to do it yourself.

## Conclusion

Finding the best hashtags for YouTube is an easy but also important task. It's all the little things combined that help you get more viewers. Things like using the right keywords, thumbnails, YouTube tags, etc.

Yet, it would help if you didn't forget the most important thing: the video itself. So, give Filmora a try and become surprised by how easy it is to create a high-quality YouTube video.

Best YouTube Vlog Hashtags

Hashtags are powerful features that can connect the right viewer to your content. They merge videos and viewers with similar topics and interests.

If you have a vlog on YouTube, there is a set of hashtags that work perfectly with this type of content.

This is a list that might help:

* #vloggingmylife
* #vlogginggear
* #vloggerlife
* #vloggers
* #vloglife
* #vlogger
* #vlogging
* #youtuber
* #vlogs
* #dailyvlog
* #vloggingcamera
* #vloging
* #vloggingcommunity
* #vloggerlifestyle
* #travelvlogging
* #vloggingmum
* #foodvlogging
* #vlogginglife
* #newtovlogging
* #disneyvlogging
* #vlogging101
* #vloggingsetup
* #vloggingfamily
* #vlogday
* #kidsvlogging
* #imvlogginghere
* #beautyvlogging
* #microvlogging
* #motovlogging
* #instavlogging

When using hashtags for YouTube, it's essential to put yourself in your viewers' shoes. So first, ask yourself what your ideal viewer is searching for.

For example, if you’re creating a video on how to cook past, think about all the ways the viewer would search for this on YouTube. A few hashtags may come to mind are #pastarecipes, #pastacooking, #tasypasta, and so on. I hope you get the idea of how hashtags work.

This may take a lot of time. However, a YouTube hashtag generator can make this process a lot quicker and even more effective.

## Best Tools for YouTube Vlog Hashtags

You should know that more than these thirty hashtags will be needed to help your videos succeed. But sometimes, you will need better or more appropriate ones.

The best way to always have the perfect tags is to use a YouTube hashtags generator. It's a tool that digs up the ideal tags for every type of video.

Here are the three best YouTube hashtag generators you can use:

### 1 [Keyword Tool](https://keywordtool.io/youtube)

This tool's primary purpose may be to help with keyword research, but it has a valuable hashtag extension.

First, type in the topic of your video. For example, "vlog." Hit Search.

![youtube hashtag generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-keyword-tool.jpg)

Then, select the Hashtags panel.

![youtube hashtag tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hashtag-panel.jpg)

This will show you a massive list of trending hashtags you can use for your YouTube video. However, the YouTube tags it gives you will sometimes be different. For example, if you search for the same word at another time, the results may differ depending on current trends.

![list of tags for youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/youtube-hashtags.jpg)

That's all there is to it. Copy any tags you like and use them for your video. Also, you can purchase the pro version of this tool to get more detailed insights. However, the free version works just fine most of the time. The choice is yours.
