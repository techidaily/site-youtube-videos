### 1\. [MrBeast](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbeast6000) $58 Million

![mrbeast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/highest-paid-youtuber-in-the-world-2022-1.jpg)

The richest YouTuber that makes the most out of YouTube is no other than MrBeast. Jimmy Donaldson, the MrBeast, is a YouTube star that has made record-breaking world earnings in the recent year from his YouTube channel with over 100 Million subscribers.

The extravagant stunts and philanthropist endeavors of MrBeast attract so many people like bees to honey.

But that’s not all; the MrBeast Burger app has also contributed to skyrocketing the earnings of Mr. Beast. With this mobile application, MrBeast handles marketing among his 100M+ subscribers while keeping a share of the sales.

Here's one of his recent popular videos where MrBeast hunted for 100 people.

[I Hunted 100 People For $1,000,000](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=65fN%5FOUawjk).

**Earning in 2021**

$54 Million.

### 2\. [Jake Paul](https://www.youtube.com/c/jakepaul/featured) $60 Million

![jake paul](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/highest-paid-youtuber-in-the-world-2022-2.jpg)

The next richest YouTuber, second only to MrBeast, is the famous boxer Jake Paul.

The personality of Jake paul is so bright that it continuously keeps him in the headlines.

Jake was a substantial part of the top 10 highest-paid YouTubers until 2017, but it was all busted by his brother Logan when he posted a video widely known as "Suicide Forest." The backlash was so harsh that many sponsors cut off from Jake, and even YouTube stopped monetizing the channel.

But that's all in the past because Jake is here again and on the second spot, of course.

Let's look at a video from Jake Paul.

[I turned down $40 million for this.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L7oKNLYCapw&t=24s)

**Earning in 2021**

![markiplier](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/highest-paid-youtuber-in-the-world-2022-3.jpg)

Now comes Mark Fischbach, aka Markiplier, a YouTube star that started his journey in 2012 as an avid gamer.

But later on, his Unus Annus series increased his popularity dramatically in 2019\. This series was created with Co-Youtuber Ethan Nestor Darling. But the sad news is that Markiplier deliberately removed this series from his channel a year ago.

But the other thing that has greatly helped Markiplier in raking all this income is his ability to move Merchandise like T-shirts, hoodies, and other items. So it is of no surprise that he remains one of the richest YouTubers in the world.

Let's have a look at one of his trending videos.

[In Space with Markiplier: Part 1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j64oZLF443g)

A new YouTube star that popped up in the list of top 10 highest-paid YouTubers last year is Unspeakable.

Going by the name Natham Graham, unspeakable continuously makes videos of his little “Minecraft” games and has been posting them on his channel for the last 10 years.

But last year, he made a smart move and sold the whole catalog of his YouTube videos to “Spotter” in one go.

So what did he get in return? A huge lump sum, of course.

Here's a video of Unspeakable.

The last YouTube star in our list of the 10 highest-paid YouTubers is Preston Arsement.

This young lad has increased his popularity with first-class gaming and pranking skills.

**Earning in 2021**

$16 Million.

After seeing all these highest-paid YouTubers, you must be wondering what makes them earn so much money with just a YouTube channel.

Here are some reasons that decide the highest-earning Youtubers.

## Part3\. What Decides the Highest-Earning YouTubers?

Multiple factors influence YouTubers' earnings.

First of all, it’s the subscribers’ growth. As subscribers to the YouTube channel increase, the creator can apply for YouTube’s Partner Program and start monetizing the channel with channel membership or subscriptions.

That’s not all; the creator can also use different ads, and the revenue generated can even be in millions if you have a lot of subscribers.

Then comes the channel type. If the channel is a niche, it will not make as much money as channels that meet the public's appetite.

Lastly, we can't ignore the quality of videos, can we?

A high-quality video with multiple transitions, effects, and interactive scenes is a must if you want to gain popularity on your YouTube channel.

So how can we make our videos top-notch?

Read on and find the answer in the bonus tip below.

### Bonus Tip to Increase YouTube Money

[**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Now, YouTube is not the only social media platform for making money. TikTokers are also earning a fortune nowadays. But which one of them is better? Let’s have a look at it.

**Are YouTubers Earning More Money than TikTokers?**

With analysis, it’s crystal clear that YouTubers are making more money than TickTokers, and it’s not without reason.

In the year 2021, YouTube has paid more than 15 Billion US$ to its creators altogether, according to [JUMPSTART](https://www.jumpstartmag.com/youtube-vs-tiktok-which-platform-pays-its-creators-better/). And it’s to be expected because Youtubers have been making content for way longer than TickTokers.

For example, MrBeast posted his first video on YouTube in 2012, and it has been about 10 years since he created his content.

**Are Highest-Paid YouTube Stars Always Trending?**

Since the highest-paid YouTubers make so much money, you may think they are always “Trending” on YouTube.

Sorry to pop your bubble, but they are not.

The highest-paid YouTubers may have a ton of subscribers, but being in “Trending” is different.

The most important reason is that the “Trending” part of YouTube shows popular videos in the specific area of the users, so it varies depending upon the user's location.

## Final Words

The world's biggest video-sharing platform, YouTube, offers an opportunity to all content creators.

And those who get on the top strike a fortune without a doubt.

The top 10 highest-paid YouTubers are listed in this article who are making millions of dollars with their YouTube channel.

## Part2\. Highest-Paid YouTubers in the World 2022

### 1\. [MrBeast](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbeast6000) $58 Million

![mrbeast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/highest-paid-youtuber-in-the-world-2022-1.jpg)

The richest YouTuber that makes the most out of YouTube is no other than MrBeast. Jimmy Donaldson, the MrBeast, is a YouTube star that has made record-breaking world earnings in the recent year from his YouTube channel with over 100 Million subscribers.

The extravagant stunts and philanthropist endeavors of MrBeast attract so many people like bees to honey.

But that’s not all; the MrBeast Burger app has also contributed to skyrocketing the earnings of Mr. Beast. With this mobile application, MrBeast handles marketing among his 100M+ subscribers while keeping a share of the sales.

Here's one of his recent popular videos where MrBeast hunted for 100 people.

[I Hunted 100 People For $1,000,000](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=65fN%5FOUawjk).

**Earning in 2021**

![jake paul](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/highest-paid-youtuber-in-the-world-2022-2.jpg)

The next richest YouTuber, second only to MrBeast, is the famous boxer Jake Paul.

The personality of Jake paul is so bright that it continuously keeps him in the headlines.

Jake was a substantial part of the top 10 highest-paid YouTubers until 2017, but it was all busted by his brother Logan when he posted a video widely known as "Suicide Forest." The backlash was so harsh that many sponsors cut off from Jake, and even YouTube stopped monetizing the channel.

But that's all in the past because Jake is here again and on the second spot, of course.

Let's look at a video from Jake Paul.

[I turned down $40 million for this.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L7oKNLYCapw&t=24s)

Now comes Mark Fischbach, aka Markiplier, a YouTube star that started his journey in 2012 as an avid gamer.

But later on, his Unus Annus series increased his popularity dramatically in 2019\. This series was created with Co-Youtuber Ethan Nestor Darling. But the sad news is that Markiplier deliberately removed this series from his channel a year ago.

But the other thing that has greatly helped Markiplier in raking all this income is his ability to move Merchandise like T-shirts, hoodies, and other items. So it is of no surprise that he remains one of the richest YouTubers in the world.

Let's have a look at one of his trending videos.

[In Space with Markiplier: Part 1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j64oZLF443g)
