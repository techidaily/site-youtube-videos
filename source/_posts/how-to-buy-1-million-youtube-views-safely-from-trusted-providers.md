Can you buy 1 million YouTube views? Won't YouTube ban your account?

Disclaimer: We in no way endorse the practice of buying views. It could be dangerous for your channel and will damage your credibility with your real viewers if they find out.

Buying views isn’t necessarily against YouTube’s rules (it is against the spirit of the rules and can still get you in trouble), depending on how you do it (in general: buying real-people views is technically not against the rules and buying bot views is definitely against them). There are many companies that claim to sell high-quality views that can actually get you in trouble.

So, who can you trust?

## **How to Buy 1 Million YouTube Views**

Something to watch out for is if a service says you will reach 1 million views almost overnight. These sites either cannot really deliver on the time frame they promise or are not providing ‘real’ views. They may be using bots that generate a large number of fake views quickly, which can be dangerous for your channel.

What you want are high retention views from real humans. Quality services, like the ones listed below, will have real people watch your videos (or at least play them all the way through while they do other things). A good turnaround period for 1 million YouTube views is between 6 and 8 months. A waiting period of a few months is necessary if you want viewer retention.

Viewer retention means someone is actually watching your video, not just clicking on it and clicking away (which is bad for your search engine ranking). Beware that almost all view buying sites will claim to sell high retention views regardless of if they do or not.

Trustworthy services often have other services available, such as Social Promotion on other social media platforms or YouTube likes and comments. These will help to encourage more organic views, likes, and comments. Also, if your views go up but you have no likes or comments then that might tip people off that you’ve bought views and while it is not against the rules there is certainly a stigma attached.

It is worth mentioning that while buying human views is not technically against YouTube's rules and can be done safely, [buying subscribers is more dangerous](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## **Where To Buy 1 Million YouTube Views**

[BuyViewsReview](http://buyviewsreview.com/) is a site dedicated to helping you avoid scams that can hurt your channel. They test companies that sell views to make sure they can deliver on their promises safely. It really pays off to spend some time there and learn about the [view selling industry](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/don%E2%80%99t-get-scammed--buy-safe-youtube-views-from-top-providers-290.html) before you jump in and start spending money.

Here are BuyViewsReveiew’s top 3 trusted providers from whom you can buy 1 million YouTube views safely:

 **#1: Devumi:**

Devumi offers a 100% money-back guarantee, which should be a given for these kinds of services. They have a reasonable completion time of an average of 3 to 4 months for most orders, and you can stake advantage of the video SEO service for free. According to BuyViewsReview’s test, their customer service is excellent.

You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $3,497 on Devumi.

 **#2: BuyViews:**

BuyViews is another option when you're trying to reach 1 million views on YouTube. Offering a 100% money-back guarantee just like Devumi, BuyViews’ average time of completion is slightly lower. With this service, you can also buy likes and comments or take advantage of their social promotion options.

You can buy 1 million views for $4,000 on BuyViews, which is slightly more than Devumi’s price.

 **#3: FastFollowerz:**

FastFollowersz also offers a 100% money-back guarantee. They are able to deliver on their promises, but they are in the number 3 slot because they are not totally safe – 2/5 videos in BuyViewsReviews’ test of this service were taken down by YouTube. It also seems like the views they offer are low retention, which can hurt your channel even if your videos don’t get removed.

You can buy 1 million YouTube views for $2,800 on FastFollowerz, which is significantly less than the two higher-ranked options.

Finding ways to engage your YouTube audience and attract new followers requires a lot of dedication and hard work. Even though there are only a handful of channels built entirely around **reaction videos**, this genre of videos can help you make your channel more diverse.

However, copyright restrictions prevent you from commenting on any video you find interesting, which is the reason why you have to get creative while choosing the next idea for a reaction video. So, in this article we are going to take you through some of the **best YouTube video reaction ideas** you can use to comment on different types of YouTube videos.

Previously we have demonstrated [how to create a YouTube reaction video with Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), check it to get some inspiration.

## 10 Best YouTube Video Reaction Ideas You Should Try in 2021

The process of [making a YouTube video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) starts with an idea and the idea you choose often determines how good that video is going to be. The fact that reaction videos are so popular on YouTube right now, makes the idea selection even more important because just one good idea may boost your number of followers significantly. Here are some of the best video reaction ideas you can use to comment on different topics.

### 1\. React to music videos

Music videos are among the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, which makes them perfect to react to. You can share your opinion about the musician, their latest work or the video’s visual aspects. Obtaining the copyrights to the music video you would like to comment on is very important, because you may be forced to delete your reaction video if you don’t.

### 2\. Video game reactions

Video games like Minecraft, Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto attract a lot of attention on YouTube, and if you are a fan of any of them you can easily react to the gameplay. Reacting to video games is only a good idea if your channel is dedicated to gaming, because otherwise, this reaction video idea may seem off-topic.

### 3\. React to video’s comments

YouTubers that already have thousands of followers need to keep coming up with new ways to engage their audience. Encouraging the viewers of your videos to comment on them can be a valuable source of ideas for reaction videos. You can comment on the topics that were discussed in the comments and address particular questions your followers have asked you.

### 4\. Make a ‘Kids React To’ videos

Videos of children reacting to different genres of music are already getting thousands of views every day. So, if you like working with children you should consider making a variation of this type of video. There are so many different things children can react to, you just have to find a few that fit perfectly into your channel’s topic.

### 5\. React to ‘React To’ Videos

Even though reacting to a reaction video sounds silly, it is anything but because by doing so you will open up space for a dialogue with other YouTubers. Besides being funny, this is also an opportunity to give your two cents on topics that are most relevant for your channel. In addition, the YouTube audience loves collaborations between YouTubers, which will give you and your associates the opportunity to increase the size of your audience.

### 6\. Comment on your old videos

Producing new content for your YouTube channel regularly is important for so many reasons, but recycling old material from time to time can allow you to reflect on the topics you already covered. In addition, you’ll remind your viewers of your old videos and give them the reason to watch them again. Opting to comment on the videos you made in the past can also help you avoid potential copyright complications.

### 7\. Record reactions of elderly people

It becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the latest pop culture trends as we get older. That’s why elderly people often have trouble understanding the taste of younger generations. Recording their reactions to fashion choices young people make or the music they listen to can be hilarious, which makes it an excellent reaction video idea.

### 8\. React to different challenges

Over the course of the last decade, we’ve seen so many challenges go viral, as even the world’s most famous politicians took part in some of them. Challenge videos are not as popular as they used to be a few years ago, but they still amass thousands of views. Making funny reaction videos to different challenge videos may help you boost your number of followers, especially if you come up with witty remarks for each video you comment on.

### 9\. React to TV shows

We all love watching a good TV show, whether it is a TV series or a reality show. So, if you are looking for a reaction video idea that can hardly fail, commenting on a TV show may be the right choice for you. However, getting the right to use the footage you would like to comment on may be difficult, as making the reaction video without permission from the copyright owner may have legal implications.

### 10\. Comment on [movie trailers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you are running a movie channel on YouTube, your followers are expecting your comment on the latest releases. Sharing your opinion about trailers of movies you like or dislike with your audience is going to help you start a conversation about that movie. This idea is only worth considering if you are a movie buff, since analyzing a movie trailer or reacting to it is anything but easy.

Here are some of the best video reaction ideas you can use to comment on different topics.

### 1\. React to music videos

Music videos are among the most popular genres of videos on YouTube, which makes them perfect to react to. You can share your opinion about the musician, their latest work or the video’s visual aspects. Obtaining the copyrights to the music video you would like to comment on is very important, because you may be forced to delete your reaction video if you don’t.

### 2\. Video game reactions

Video games like Minecraft, Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto attract a lot of attention on YouTube, and if you are a fan of any of them you can easily react to the gameplay. Reacting to video games is only a good idea if your channel is dedicated to gaming, because otherwise, this reaction video idea may seem off-topic.

### 3\. React to video’s comments

YouTubers that already have thousands of followers need to keep coming up with new ways to engage their audience. Encouraging the viewers of your videos to comment on them can be a valuable source of ideas for reaction videos. You can comment on the topics that were discussed in the comments and address particular questions your followers have asked you.

### 4\. Make a ‘Kids React To’ videos

Videos of children reacting to different genres of music are already getting thousands of views every day. So, if you like working with children you should consider making a variation of this type of video. There are so many different things children can react to, you just have to find a few that fit perfectly into your channel’s topic.

### 5\. React to ‘React To’ Videos

Even though reacting to a reaction video sounds silly, it is anything but because by doing so you will open up space for a dialogue with other YouTubers. Besides being funny, this is also an opportunity to give your two cents on topics that are most relevant for your channel. In addition, the YouTube audience loves collaborations between YouTubers, which will give you and your associates the opportunity to increase the size of your audience.

### 6\. Comment on your old videos

Producing new content for your YouTube channel regularly is important for so many reasons, but recycling old material from time to time can allow you to reflect on the topics you already covered. In addition, you’ll remind your viewers of your old videos and give them the reason to watch them again. Opting to comment on the videos you made in the past can also help you avoid potential copyright complications.

### 7\. Record reactions of elderly people

It becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the latest pop culture trends as we get older. That’s why elderly people often have trouble understanding the taste of younger generations. Recording their reactions to fashion choices young people make or the music they listen to can be hilarious, which makes it an excellent reaction video idea.

### 8\. React to different challenges

Over the course of the last decade, we’ve seen so many challenges go viral, as even the world’s most famous politicians took part in some of them. Challenge videos are not as popular as they used to be a few years ago, but they still amass thousands of views. Making funny reaction videos to different challenge videos may help you boost your number of followers, especially if you come up with witty remarks for each video you comment on.

### 9\. React to TV shows

We all love watching a good TV show, whether it is a TV series or a reality show. So, if you are looking for a reaction video idea that can hardly fail, commenting on a TV show may be the right choice for you. However, getting the right to use the footage you would like to comment on may be difficult, as making the reaction video without permission from the copyright owner may have legal implications.
