YouTube changed its monetization policy and, once again, there are new monetization rules. Last year, in the wake of the ‘adpocalypse’ ([click here for coverage on that](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube%E2%80%99s-ad-boycott-and-how-it-probably-won%E2%80%99t-affect-you-201.html)), they imposed a new milestone of 10,000-lifetime views which a channel would have to meet before applying for monetization. As of February 20, 2018, YouTube will be introducing 2 more obstacles to monetizing your videos.

## The New Monetization Rules

In order to qualify for YouTube monetization, you must meet these milestones.

 1. You will need to have 1,000 subscribers.
 2. You will need to have accumulated 4,000 hours of watch time over the last 12 months.

 [You can read the full announcement here.](https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2018/01/additional-changes-to-youtube-partner.html)

 _Trying to get monetization on YouTube can feel like this._

## Why YouTube Changed the Monetization Rules

YouTube’s reasoning for these changes is essentially the same as they gave for the 10,000 views milestone: having higher standards will help them prevent inappropriate or stolen content from being monetized. They also point out that the majority of channels affected will not have been making any significant money anyways (less than $2.50 per month, in most cases).

## How Do the Changes Affect Small YouTube Channels

However, even if the immediate financial impact won’t be that financially significant, it is untrue to say these new rules will not affect YouTubers with smaller channels. Having to plan to achieve and maintain those 4,000 hours of watch time and 1,000 subs could have a major impact on how creators plan their content. Will you feel pressured to abandon content that you and your existing viewers love in favor of making videos that will get you to those milestones faster?

  That will be a question facing a lot of smaller YouTubers, especially those who have already reached 1,000 subscribers and are now in a situation where they have to maintain those 4,000 hours of watch time. You won't be cut off from monetization automatically if you fall from 4,000 hours to 3,500 hours one month (after already having monetized your channel), but YouTube may review your channel and remove monetization if time passes and you still haven't gotten back up to 4,000 hours.

These new rules could also put niche channels at a disadvantage. Niche channels may have devoted followers who keep their watch time up, but getting to 1,000 subscribers could be harder for them purely because their potential audience is already smaller.

## Join The Conversation

There have been b reactions to this news in our forums here on filmora.io, the majority of them negative. Although the perspective that these kinds of measures are necessary as YouTube becomes more and more crowded has also been represented, the majority of people who have weighed in find these changes unreasonable. If you haven't yet, make sure to head over to the forums and [join the conversation](https://www.filmora.io/forum/).

It probably doesn’t help that none of the regulations being put in place to stop smaller channels who might be ‘bad actors’ (YouTube uses the term several times in their announcement) will affect gigantic channels whose creators may already be behaving in wildly inappropriate (and not at all ad friendly) ways.

Cough. Logan Paul. Cough.

## Tips for Increasing YouTube Watch Time

1. Sorting your videos into playlists encourages viewers to spend a lot more time on your channel.
2. Link your videos together using cards and interactive end screens/outros.
3. Basic video editing. Simple things like adding transition effects and cutting out long pauses will help keep viewers watching your videos for longer.

Wanting to be paid for doing what you love is only natural, and you can still get there (YouTube monetization isn't even the only way). There may even be better opportunities to generate revenue when you do. In the long run, this could be a good thing for YouTube. Nobody can really know yet.

# Top 5 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

First impressions matter, in real life and in the world of online content production. The attention span of an average person who watches videos online is rather limited, which means that you, as a YouTube video creator, have only a small window of opportunity to captivate their attention. A 3D intro can be just the thing you need to set the tone for an entire video, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best intro makers you can use on your PC or Mac computers, online or on your Smartphones.

## The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos

Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.

[Wondershare Filmstock Gaming Video Editing Skils](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/learn-gaming-video-editing-skills-banner.png)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-game?source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle&spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb)

#### 1. [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This is an online platform that features hundreds of templates created by the platform’s users. Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.

#### 2. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Linux, Windows, macOS

Creating visual effects, tracking objects or making 3D intros for your YouTube videos are just a few, among numerous things you can do with Blender. This is an open source software, which means that anyone who is skillful enough can become a contributor. Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.

#### 3. [Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/)

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $9,99 for a single export

**Compatibility:** web-based

You can use Renderforest for much more than just making intros, as the platform offers the tools for logo creation, video editing, and website design. The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.

#### 4. [MotionDen](https://motionden.com/)

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $9,00

**Compatibility:** web-based

Making 2D animations, birthday videos, commercials, logo animations or 3D intros for YouTube videos on the MotionDen platform is easy. There are hundreds of templates organized in categories and you just have to go to YouTube Intros category and select the intro you’d like to add to your YouTube video. You must create an account on the MotionDen platform, if you want to customize your videos before you download them. Keep in mind that you can only edit and download one intro for free and that you must choose a subscription plan in order to be able to fully customize the 3D YouTube intro you’ve selected and download it to your computer without a watermark. MotionDen is a great source of material for all YouTube content creators who don’t want to spend a lot of time creating 3D intros from scratch and would rather quickly customize a template before adding it to their project.

#### 5. [Intro Maker for YouTube](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryzenrise.intromaker&hl=en)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** Android

If you choose to install the Intro Maker for YouTube app on your phone you will be able to create intros for your YouTube videos in just a couple of minutes. There are over 4000 free intro templates to choose from that are organized around themes such as Game, Nature City or Timelapse and there are a number of styles available so you can try out 3D or Glitch intros. The app also features more than a hundred royalty-free songs, as well as a diverse collection of sound effects you can add to the intros you customize. The app’s text editing capabilities are remarkable since you can animate the text with twenty different animations, change a font or control the shadows. The only downside is that you are going to have to make in-app purchases if you want to unlock all the features the app has to offer.

A 3D intro can be just the thing you need to set the tone for an entire video, so in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best intro makers you can use on your PC or Mac computers, online or on your Smartphones.

## The 5 Best 3D Intro Makers for YouTube Videos

Creating 3D animations from scratch is far from easy since you are going to need to be familiar with both the animation techniques and the animation software you’re using to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos. That’s why some of the intro makers, we included in this article, offer customizable templates that enable you to create stunning intros for your videos with ease. So, let’s get started.

#### 1. [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

This is an online platform that features hundreds of templates created by the platform’s users. Some of these templates are free to use, while some creators ask for a credit if you want to open your video with their intro. Each of the templates can be customized in accordance with the demands of your project from the platform’s Clipmaker, and you can even create your own account where you can save all your projects. After you’ve selected an intro you like, you can pick a new environment, insert new text and change its font, size or appearance, among other things. You can also adjust the Position, Rotation or Shake options in the Camera menu, and you can upload your own music, apply the fade in and fade out sound effects or adjust the sound volume from the Audio tab. When done, you should head over to the Download menu where you choose the Render Mode, and the format of the file you’re rendering before you save a watermark-free video to your computer.

#### 2. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Linux, Windows, macOS

Creating visual effects, tracking objects or making 3D intros for your YouTube videos are just a few, among numerous things you can do with Blender. This is an open source software, which means that anyone who is skillful enough can become a contributor. Moreover, you can develop the tools and add-ons on your own and customize the interface in virtually any way you want. Nonetheless, you must be a proficient 3D modeler and animator in order to be able to use Blender to create 3D intros for your YouTube videos, as the tools the software offers can be overwhelming for inexperienced users. On the other hand, Blender may be one of the best 3D creation suites around, so if you have plenty of experience with modeling, animation, compositing or motion tracking you should try creating 3D intros with this powerful software.

#### 3. [Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/)

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $9,99 for a single export

**Compatibility:** web-based

You can use Renderforest for much more than just making intros, as the platform offers the tools for logo creation, video editing, and website design. The platform also contains a huge intro the collection you can use free of charge. What’s more, you can customize each intro by changing the text, adjusting its colors or adding a voice-over. Renderforest lets you use its music library to create a soundtrack for the intro, or you can upload your own music from a computer and add it to the intro you’re making. Downloading the intros and all other videos you make with Renderforest is not possible unless you create an account. In addition, all the visual content you produce with the free version of Renderforest is going to be watermarked and in relatively poor resolution, which is why you have to select a subscription plan that allows you to get rid of the watermark and download videos in high-resolution.

#### 4. [MotionDen](https://motionden.com/)

**Price:** Free, subscription plans start at $9,00

**Compatibility:** web-based

Making 2D animations, birthday videos, commercials, logo animations or 3D intros for YouTube videos on the MotionDen platform is easy. There are hundreds of templates organized in categories and you just have to go to YouTube Intros category and select the intro you’d like to add to your YouTube video. You must create an account on the MotionDen platform, if you want to customize your videos before you download them. Keep in mind that you can only edit and download one intro for free and that you must choose a subscription plan in order to be able to fully customize the 3D YouTube intro you’ve selected and download it to your computer without a watermark. MotionDen is a great source of material for all YouTube content creators who don’t want to spend a lot of time creating 3D intros from scratch and would rather quickly customize a template before adding it to their project.

#### 5. [Intro Maker for YouTube](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryzenrise.intromaker&hl=en)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

The app also features more than a hundred royalty-free songs, as well as a diverse collection of sound effects you can add to the intros you customize. The app’s text editing capabilities are remarkable since you can animate the text with twenty different animations, change a font or control the shadows.
