## Why Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?

When people are searching for something to watch on YouTube, they'll look at two (2) things:

1. They'll check the title to see how relevant it is to what they're looking for.
2. Two, they'll check the video thumbnail.

Thumbnail helps them determine off the bat if the video is high quality or not. A poor thumbnail will push them away, while a good one will encourage them to click.

That said, YouTubers should ensure their thumbnails are on point. Your thumbnails should be visually striking. One way to achieve that is by changing the thumbnail background.

## How To Change YouTube Thumbnail Background?

Suppose you have downloaded a high-quality image that will work great as a thumbnail background for your YouTube video. What shall you do next? Of course, the next step is to make the actual thumbnail.

Choosing the background image from [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is great because it saves you lots of time and resources. The program allows you to select from millions of high-quality options. After selecting, you can use Filmora's native features to edit the thumbnail. You can even resize the thumbnail background to 1280x720 - YouTube's suggested thumbnail size.

It is more convenient than you may initially think. Yes, it saves you time and effort because you don't have to switch to another program to edit the thumbnail. But it also makes the workload easier for your computer. Opening another program will eat more RAM and will slow down the computer.

Filmora's tools for editing the video thumbnail aren't too shabby, either. Suppose you have a great image with the main subject where exactly you want it to be. However, you want to change the background to make the subject stand out more. You can use Wondershare Filmora's AI Portrait feature to easily change it.

Then, you can delete or change the background with the thumbnail background that you have downloaded. It's really convenient!

Here is a guide on changing a YouTube thumbnail background using Wondershare Filmora.

## What is a YouTube Playlist?

Irritated from surfing over the Internet for videos related to your concept or topic you are searching for? Else are you a party-hard person who needs continuously playing of fantastic music to keeping the fun going? YouTube playlists are the better option: a collection of videos that keep playing in order, sequentially, and play one after another automatically unless you change it manually.

![What is YouTube Playlist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-youtube-playlist.png)

It is closely related to the music playlists like the ones we find in Spotify and Apple music. Different playlists on YouTube are available in all genres, like entertainment, fun, relaxation, thrilling, and educational niches. Do you have a monotonous routine at the office? Let’s play something crazy and fun-filled like the comedy series or bloopers? Need some workout ideas? Check out the compilation of different custom fitness workouts as a playlist on YouTube. Whatever you want, you can find everything in YouTube playlists.

It is a fantastic app that can do wonders that one could think. Besides being used for the fun-filled purposes, they are content curation tools that can be used by marketers as a platform to attract customers and engage with them with various product videos under a single roof called playlists.

If you are a tricky person who has a changing mindset and different mood-offs, you can create your playlists that combine all your favorite videos from varied niches.

## Difference between a Channel and a Playlist on YouTube

There are times where one gets confused with the YouTube channels and playlists. While some say they are similar, the fact is both are different. A person with a specific name creates a channel, and it is the place where the person posts all the videos or uploads them for his/her subscribers to get likes and more audience.

![What is YouTube Channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-youtube-channel.jpg)

But YouTube playlists are auto-generated contents that consist of videos from different channels but with the same content concept. For example, a PewDiePie channel will have his uploaded videos. Still, PewDiePie playlists will have all his videos and the ones similar to his stream but off the channel. Likewise, self-created playlists will have videos that you have saved to see them later or often.

## What are the benefits of a playlist on YouTube?

There are various YouTube and video creators who have undervalued playlists' importance, and hence the hidden benefits are often off-screen. So, we have listed the top 5 reasons why YouTube playlists are essential and how a YouTuber can benefit from playlists.

#### 1\.  YouTube playlists help you organize videos in order

YouTube these days appears scattered with numerous information where some are important at the critical instances of time. You also have some playlists that are the effective ones grouped based on a common theme. Suppose your company focuses on selling musical equipment. In that case, you can make separate playlists for a guitar or pianos so that viewers can come across different equipment styles, available variants allowing them to navigate through various parts in your channel. Alongside this, you can tell your viewers what the YouTube channel or the organization is all about at first glance as the first impression is the best expression!

#### 2\.  Increase the rank of your video

If your video gets added to a playlist, there are high chances for it to be in the YouTube watchlist even it is less popular but related to the ones that the audience prefers. In turn, this act raises your video's rank as the "total watch time" is a vital factor that drives your video to the highly ranked video list.

#### 3\.  Playlists account to discoverability and improve visibility on search engines

Apart from being enlisted as single videos, individual videos indexed in playlists get opportunities to appear on the search engines based on the keywords. Playlists are bread slices packed with jam as keywords providing likelihood to emerge on multiple times. But to catch the gain of this method, one has to enrich the video with an outstanding keyword, titles, or description and optimize the video with remarkable SEO techniques.

#### 4\.  Get more views

When your video comes under a theme and is categorized, the YouTube algorithm places it over with the other related to each other. The next time, your video will appear on the right sidebar below the "related videos." As the video plays automatically, one after the other, the number of views increases. "Amazing playlists can make viewers watch it longer!"

#### 5\.  Playlists are best for video SEO

Such playlists can boost and help one to reach your YouTube channel. Especially when it comes to educators or artists, they provide value and save time. Playlists get ranked for keywords that help your audience in reaching you on YouTube.
