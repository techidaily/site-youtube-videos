* [Part 2: How to Use Wondershare Filmora to Improve Video Qualtiy](#part2)

## How to Use YouTube Enhancements

 First of all, you need to locate YouTube Enhancements. As soon as you have logged into your YouTube channel, you should go to the Video Manager. There you choose Edit and YouTube Enhancements, and you are ready to go. There are three distinctive categories that you can use, in order to edit your video. You can choose among Quick Fix, Filters, and Blurring Effects. As you can see, there are features that pretty much cover the basics in video editing under these categories.

![Locate enhancements features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/locate-enhancements-feature.jpg )

 Quick Fix promptly addresses issues that have to do with the contrast and saturation, as well as offers the ability to rotate or trim the video. There is nothing sophisticated there, but it is a really easy and practical solution for those who do not wish to waste time editing. It is cool that you can also stabilize your video or allow for Slow Motion or Timelapse effects. This is definitely an improvement for YouTube videos.

![Qucik Fix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quick-fix.jpg )

 Filters feel a lot like those used on Instagram. They are neat and cool, of course, covering many of the demands for sophisticated editing. You can find filters like Lomo-ish, Old Fashioned, Heat Map, Cartoon, Cross Process, Festival and much more on YouTube Enhancements. You can also adjust the lighting and colors, so as to fine-tune your video.

![YouTube Filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-filters.jpg )

 Blurring Effects are perhaps the most advanced on YouTube Enhancements, and they provide the opportunity to maintain your privacy, by removing people’s distinctive details from the video and blurring them or putting mosaic on their face. With this tool, you can also blur objects on the video, which can increase your privacy even more. For instance, you can blur the plates of your car or your address. Last, there are some hilarious effects that you should check out.

![YouTube Costum Blurring](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-costum-blurring.jpg )

 Once you are done, there is an option to preview the video that you have edited. In this way, you will know if the editions that you have made are sufficient for you or not. Finally, you can choose either to save the video as a new file or revert to the original video. These options are welcome, as sometimes you just do not get what you have expected and you do not want to replace the video you have already uploaded.

## How to Use Wondershare Filmora to improve YouTube videos

 These are the steps that you need to follow, so as to proceed with high-quality video editing on Filmora:

* Open Wordershare Filmora
* Choose if you want 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio
* Tap Import so as to upload the files
* Drag and drop them, in order to place them in the right order

![Import Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-videos.jpg )

* Click Edit and adjust the settings (rotation, contrast, saturation, brightness, hue, auto de-noise and speed)

![Adjust Contrast Saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-contrast-saturation.jpg )

* Click OK, and you are done with the improvement of Video Quality

 If you wish to fine-tune the images of the videos and place special filters, you can go ahead as follows:

* Tap the Effect button
* Drag the effect you want to use on the timeline (you can choose from a wide variety of effects, including Bokeh and Light Leaks, Old Film, etc.)

![Free Movie Special Effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-movie-special-effects.jpg )

 After having finished with the video editing process, you can preview the video and see if it is of acceptable quality standards. You can do that by clicking on the Play button. Then you can click on the Create button and save the video where you want, in the format of your choosing. It is also possible for you to burn the video on a DVD or share it online using YouTube or Facebook.

## FIFA's Best Players: Trendy Videos on YouTube

# Top Insights into 2018 FIFA Football Videos On YouTube \[Infographic\]

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg)

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia is over for another four years and the grand finale of this tournament was really outstanding, and France won the World Cup for the second time after overcoming Croatia 4-2 in a thrilling final in Moscow. While the entire world is anxiously about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the football videos on YouTube are booming. In fact, the football-related searches on this platform have been soaring in the months leading up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, despite the fact that some of the most popular football clubs in the world are still ignoring how powerful YouTube has become.

We have produced the infographic below which clearly shows how popular football videos are on YouTube, so let's have a look at some of the mind-blowing facts we've discovered.

![top insights into football videos on youtube](https://filmora.wondershare.com/youtube-video-editing/top-insights-into-football-videos-on-youtube.png)

## Football Content Has Never Been More Popular on YouTube

The football gods, like Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Neymar Jr are making enormous amounts of money, in addition to having an iconic status in the mass media. Such state of affairs explains why YouTube videos with these superstars saw an 80% increase in watch time over the course of the last year.

Interestingly, the highest amount of football-related searches on the world's largest video sharing platform are coming from the South American and European countries. For example, France's young star Kylian Mbappé is a popular search in his home country, while videos of Messi, Ronaldo or Neymar are popular searches around the globe.

The number of YouTube users who are watching the game highlights has doubled over the course of the last two years, while the number of match recap viewers has increased 9 times since the last World Cup in 2014\. The live streaming content related to football is also gaining momentum, although it still isn't nearly as popular as the Trick Shot videos or Drills and Skills videos that saw a 6x increase in watch time in the last four years.

Furthermore, some of the most viewed videos on YouTube are football related, since Shakira's Waka Waka, the official 2010 World Cup song currently has 1.9 billion views. These statistics show how big the football audience on YouTube really is, and that brands and independent entrepreneurs have much to gain by including football related content on their YouTube channels.

Music videos related to previous World Cups have attracted 12% of women more than the videos that show footage of the Euro Cup, which clearly demonstrates that large audiences can be reached if the video doesn't include the actual gameplay.

As a matter of fact, football audiences are also largely attracted to gaming content, entertainment, and music videos since as much as 18% of the football audience frequently watches entertainment videos.

## Are Sports the Next Big Thing On YouTube?

At the moment, sports videos are growing faster than any other genre of videos you can find on YouTube, including entertainment or music, while the branded partnerships in this niche are growing 111% faster than all of the sports videos combined. The window of opportunity is clear for all brands that support sports activities.

Furthermore, brand ads for corporate giants such as Nike, Gatorade or Addidas attracted millions of views, which means that the leading brands in the world of sports have recognized YouTube as a marketplace they can no longer ignore. Brands that want to gain more recognition on the international market can seize this opportunity to team up with influencers on YouTube to present and broaden the reach of their products.

Besides soccer that is currently dominating the largest video sharing platform in the world, basketball, extreme sports and winter sports also provide access to huge audiences and show promising signs that they can help brands and influencers generate more revenue. Popular YouTubers should try to include more sports-related videos on their channels because it might help them attract new followers and secure a foothold in a rapidly growing market.

For example, France's young star Kylian Mbappé is a popular search in his home country, while videos of Messi, Ronaldo or Neymar are popular searches around the globe.

The number of YouTube users who are watching the game highlights has doubled over the course of the last two years, while the number of match recap viewers has increased 9 times since the last World Cup in 2014\. The live streaming content related to football is also gaining momentum, although it still isn't nearly as popular as the Trick Shot videos or Drills and Skills videos that saw a 6x increase in watch time in the last four years.

Furthermore, some of the most viewed videos on YouTube are football related, since Shakira's Waka Waka, the official 2010 World Cup song currently has 1.9 billion views. These statistics show how big the football audience on YouTube really is, and that brands and independent entrepreneurs have much to gain by including football related content on their YouTube channels.

Music videos related to previous World Cups have attracted 12% of women more than the videos that show footage of the Euro Cup, which clearly demonstrates that large audiences can be reached if the video doesn't include the actual gameplay.

As a matter of fact, football audiences are also largely attracted to gaming content, entertainment, and music videos since as much as 18% of the football audience frequently watches entertainment videos.

## Are Sports the Next Big Thing On YouTube?

At the moment, sports videos are growing faster than any other genre of videos you can find on YouTube, including entertainment or music, while the branded partnerships in this niche are growing 111% faster than all of the sports videos combined. The window of opportunity is clear for all brands that support sports activities.

Furthermore, brand ads for corporate giants such as Nike, Gatorade or Addidas attracted millions of views, which means that the leading brands in the world of sports have recognized YouTube as a marketplace they can no longer ignore. Brands that want to gain more recognition on the international market can seize this opportunity to team up with influencers on YouTube to present and broaden the reach of their products.

Besides soccer that is currently dominating the largest video sharing platform in the world, basketball, extreme sports and winter sports also provide access to huge audiences and show promising signs that they can help brands and influencers generate more revenue. Popular YouTubers should try to include more sports-related videos on their channels because it might help them attract new followers and secure a foothold in a rapidly growing market.
