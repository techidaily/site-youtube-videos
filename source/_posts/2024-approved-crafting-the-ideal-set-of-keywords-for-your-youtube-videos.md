There are a huge number of videos uploaded to YouTube every day, and that is why it is so important to make sure your videos are sorted properly by the site **using YouTube tags**. If you don’t, potential viewers will miss out on the chance to discover and enjoy your videos.

Instead of forcing yourself through a painful brainstorming session, it can be easier to identify the best tags using these techniques that experienced content managers use to populate their tag lists.

In this article, I will show you how to find great tags for your YouTube videos as well as some answers to the frequently asked questions about YouTube Tags.

1. [Use YouTube's Auto-Suggest Tool](#auto)
2. [Try YouTube Tag Generators](#gen)
3. [Study Your YouTube Rivals' Tags](#rival)

## Part 1: How to Find YouTube Tags \[3 Effective Ways\]

### 1. Use YouTube’s Auto-Suggest Tool to Get Tags

YouTube’s search engine can be your best ally on the quest for great tags. This tool was created to aid users who are looking for content on the platform, and content creators can benefit from it as well. By typing the general topic of your video, or a few words vaguely related to your video, into the search bar on YouTube you can see suggestions that reflect what viewers are searching for and take some of those suggestions into consideration for your tags. With every new phrase (and even every additional character you type), new options will appear. By playing around with this tool you will gain valuable insight into the searching habits of YouTube viewers.

This method may not be too precise, but the idea is to quickly gather information and perhaps get some inspiration for more creative or complex tags. Most of the suggestions will be logical, but there can be a few unexpected combinations you’d never think of. Be very careful when translating the findings to your own situation, since the fact that some terms are popular doesn’t mean they are relevant for your video. Another problem is that slightly altered terminology can significantly change the effectiveness of the tag, so you should ideally use the suggested phrases in the exact form as you found them or not at all. If you do make adjustments, you should test the new tag through the same auto-complete tool and see how it fares.

### 2.  Try YouTube Tag Generators

If you’d like to dig a little deeper, there are multiple dedicated tools that can assist you in picking the most suitable YouTube tags for every video you upload. Let’s examine a few of them in greater detail:

#### #1\. [Keyword Tool](https://keywordtool.io/youtube)

A very simple and reliable web-based tag generator that provides you with 750 frequently searched keywords that would be suitable for your video. The keyword list is based on YouTube’s search tool in a way similar to what we described in the previous chapter. However, since the analysis is automated with the Keyword Tool, you can get a huge list in just a few seconds. This generator is especially useful when you are looking for long-tail keywords that attract niche audiences.

#### #2\. [Rapid Tags](https://rapidtags.io/)

This tool is a bit more sophisticated and includes some analytic features on top of tag generating capacities, allowing you to manage your channel more effectively. It’s completely automated, so you won’t have to do any heavy lifting on your own. Just type the URL of your video into the appropriate field and let Rapid Tags do the rest. You can easily switch between the Generator, Analyzer, Ranker, and Tracker tools, so you can acquire a complete picture of the suitability of each tag and a better understanding of the projected performance of your video.

It can also analyze the tags placed on an existing YouTube video, which is important for deducing how other authors working in the same category are optimizing their content.

### 3. Study Your YouTube Rivals' Tags

No matter what your videos are about, there are probably countless other creators that want to attract the same audiences as you. Only a tiny percentage of them will manage to gain significant viewership, and those are the ones you should be researching in detail.

If you are able to locate the most successful videos with content similar to yours you are already halfway to your goal, but one obstacle still remains. You can’t even see your competitor’s tags them when you click on their videos on YouTube. This type of information is not displayed, but some specialized solutions are able to reveal it upon request. Here is one YouTube certified analytic tool capable of doing that:

## Part 3: Benefits of Transcribing YouTube Videos

You may need video transcriptions for several reasons, such as analyzing the summary of the entire speech in the video, extracting a single phrase or quote that was spoken in the clip, or making the video helpful even for those suffering from hearing impairment. When you **transcribe a YouTube video**, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:

* **Search Engine Optimization**

When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.

* **Accent**

If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.

* **Repurposing on Blogs**

If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.

* Click to open the **Actions** drop-down list from the upper-left corner
* Click **Upload a file**
  * Follow the on-screen instructions from there to upload the modified transcription file
  * Click **Save Changes** from the top-right corner of the page when done

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for a quick and easy way of adding subtitles to your videos, letting **YouTube transcribe** for you could be a good approach. However, because these auto-generated transcriptions are created by machine learning algorithms, their accuracy cannot be counted on. Therefore, the best way to get the job done accurately is, let YouTube auto-transcribe your video, download the transcription file, make the necessary changes to it, and then upload the file back to the video.

* [Part 2: Transcribe YouTube Video to Text Online with Third-Party Service](#youtube%5Fvideo%5Ftranscription%5F3rd%5Fparty%5Fservice)

## Part 1: How to Transcribe YouTube Video Automatically for Free \[2 Ways\]

Besides the [basic video editing features on the YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) platform, you can now quickly **transcribe YouTube videos to the text** as well. The good thing is, you can either use the automatic transcription feature that YouTube offers, or upload it manually while adjusting the timing as you go further.

Below are the two methods to transcribe your YouTube videos for free:

### Method 1: Use the Automated Transcription Service on YouTube

As the name suggests, YouTube automatic transcription service works automatically. This means you don’t even have to click the ‘Transcribe’ button anymore to **transcribe a YouTube video**, and the website takes care of it on its own. All you need to do is, choose English as the language of the video when setting up subtitles. You can follow the instructions given below to do so:

#### Step 1  Upload a Video

Sign in to your YouTube account, click your profile picture from the top-right corner, and click **YouTube Studio** from the menu. Next, click **CREATE** from the upper-right corner, click **Upload videos** from the menu, and drag and drop a video from your computer to the **Upload videos** box that appears next.

![Upload YouTube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-upload-video.jpg)

#### Step 2  Select Transcription Language

On the **Details** page of the next box that appears, scroll down and click **MORE OPTIONS**, and select **English** in the **Video language** drop-down list under the **Language, subtitles, and closed captions (CC)** section.

![Select Language on YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-language-on-youtube.jpg)

#### Step 3  Publish the Video

Follow the on-screen instructions from this point to publish the video, and wait while YouTube automatically transcribes and [adds the close captions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to it.

**Note:** Depending on the duration of the clip, the time YouTube would take to transcribe may vary.

After YouTube has transcribed the video, you can **download the transcription file** in your preferred format. The instructions are given below explain how you can do so:

1. **Get to the Subtitles Window**

While on the **YouTube Studio** page, click **Subtitles** from the left pane to go to the **Channel subtitles** page. And then click the video you want to modify.

1. **Get to Classic Studio**

In the video subtitle page of the target video, hover mouse on the **Published Automatic** status under the **Subtitles** column, click the **Options** icon (with three vertical dots) that appears, and click **Edit on Classic Studio**.

![YouTube Classic Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-edit-on-classic-studio.jpg)

1. **Download Transcription File**

Click and open the **Actions** drop-down list from the top-left corner of the left pane, click your preferred transcription format including .vtt, .srt and .sbv from the list, and save the file on your local hard disk.

### Method 2: Get YouTube Transcription when Watching

In addition, if you are watching any other video, you can make YouTube transcribe that for you as well. You can follow the instructions given below to get the **YouTube video to text transcription**:

**Step 1: Play the Video**

Go to the video on YouTube and start playing it. Make sure NOT to get to full-screen mode as doing so would hide the option to transcribe the clip.

**Step 2: Enable Transcription**

Click the **More** icon (with three horizontal dots) from under the bottom-right corner of the video player, and click **Open transcript** to see the video transcription in the **Transcript** pane that appears in the right.

**Step 3: Manage Timestamps**

Click the **Options** icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner of the **Transcript** pane, and click **Toggle timestamp** to enable or disable the timestamps in the video transcription.

#### Limitations of Using YouTube Transcribe

Although YouTube’s automatic transcription is a decent feature that saves you a lot of time, since Google uses machine learning algorithms to convert the speech to text, the level of accuracy may vary depending on the accent of the speaker, and the clarity of the audio the video has. Also, even sometime you may not be satisfied with the end-results.

Alternatively, you can use Kapwing to **transcribe a YouTube video** and download the transcription file with the below step-by-step instructions:

**Step 1: Add YouTube Video**

Copy the URL of YouTube video you want to transcribe, go to <https://www.kapwing.com/subtitles>, paste the URL in the **Paste a URL** field, wait while Kapwing fetches the content of the video, and opens the **Add subtitles to Video** page.

**Step 2: Transcribe the Video**

Click **Auto-generate** from the right window, and follow the on-screen instructions to **transcribe YouTube video to text**.

**Step 3: Download the Transcription File**

**Step 1: Add YouTube Video**

## Part 3: Benefits of Transcribing YouTube Videos

You may need video transcriptions for several reasons, such as analyzing the summary of the entire speech in the video, extracting a single phrase or quote that was spoken in the clip, or making the video helpful even for those suffering from hearing impairment. When you **transcribe a YouTube video**, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:

* **Search Engine Optimization**

When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.

* **Accent**

If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.

* **Repurposing on Blogs**

If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.

### YouTube Video Transcription FAQs

#### 1. How to Transcribe YouTube Video to Text

Usually the transcription files have \*.srt extension that are globally accepted and supported by almost all media players. However, there might be instances when you want to have the subtitles in plain text.

That said, to convert an SRT file to TXT, you can:

* Right-click the **SRT** file
* Go to **Rename**
* Replace **srt** with **txt** and press **Enter**
* Click **OK** on the confirmation box that appears next to convert SRT to TXT

After this, you can simply double-click the file, and read and modify the transcribed content as needed.

#### 2. How to Edit and Upload Edited Transcript to YouTube

If you made any modifications to the transcript that was automatically generated by YouTube or any other third-party transcription tool, you can follow the steps given below to upload the new file to the YouTube video:

* Go to **YouTube Studio** and then to the **Channel subtitles** page as explained earlier
* Expand the **Languages** column of the target video
* Click the **Options** icon that appears under the **Subtitles** column when you hover mouse on to it
* Click **Edit on Classic Studio**
* On the next page, click **Edit** from the top-right corner

![Edit YouTube subtitles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-automatic-youtube-video-transcription.jpg)

* Click to open the **Actions** drop-down list from the upper-left corner
* Click **Upload a file**

  * Click **Save Changes** from the top-right corner of the page when done

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for a quick and easy way of adding subtitles to your videos, letting **YouTube transcribe** for you could be a good approach. However, because these auto-generated transcriptions are created by machine learning algorithms, their accuracy cannot be counted on. Therefore, the best way to get the job done accurately is, let YouTube auto-transcribe your video, download the transcription file, make the necessary changes to it, and then upload the file back to the video.
