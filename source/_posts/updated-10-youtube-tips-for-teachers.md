## What are the similarities of the top 10 YouTubers listed above?

A few lines of thought are common with these top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers. Here are some similarities.

**Highly watchable content**  
These top YouTubers know how to engage their viewers. They take their time and give a much deeper approach to the content that they post on YouTube. It is a quick turnaround for subscribers who want value.

**Focusing on a market niche**  
These YouTubers have a passion for a particular niche. For example, film production, kid's shows, music, and so on. It seems they are talented in those areas of choice, and much focus is on how to better them.

**Engage with your audience**  
This is a crucial part if you want to be a successful YouTuber. These top 10 creators have shown that engaging with their audience has a great impact on the outcome of their production.

**They have executed channel trailers**  
Another common similarity with these top 10 YouTubers is the use of channel trailers features. You get short trailers that automatically play when a viewer lands on the YouTube channel page. These should, however, be short and give viewers a welcoming feeling to stay along.

**Call To Action**  
The reason why these content creators stay ahead is the urge to continue getting more subscribers. These channels have well-illustrated avenues for more potential subscribers. More so, they have several elements at the end-screen.

**They earn**  
Their YouTube channels are making some good bucks for them. It is estimated that PewDiePie makes about $10 million per year from his YouTube channel, while Justin Bier gets about $9 million from YouTube advertising.

## Additional thoughts - the importance of a well-made video

A well-made video is all you need to make an impact on your YouTube channel journey.

* It automatically boosts conversions and sales by engaging your viewers. In no time, this will directly lead to sales.
* Content marketing involves building trust to create a long-term relationship. A good video will let people come to you because they know you got value, just as the video attests.
* It is a perfect form of igniting emotions and engaging your viewers. So, better give them quality content.
* Videos are good platforms for viewers to learn in detail. For example, a tutorial video will show clearly the steps to follow for a particular project until success.
