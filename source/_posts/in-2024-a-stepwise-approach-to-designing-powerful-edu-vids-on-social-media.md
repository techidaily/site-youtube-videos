YouTube is an app that makes it easy for teachers to carry out their work efficiently and conveniently. A teacher should start a YouTube channel because it is beneficial to their students and themselves. The materials or content dished on these channels helps give lessons and instructions in the absence of the teacher, give a detailed explanation and trigger the students' interest.

Also, it archives all the lessons for a long time and makes them easily accessible by both the present, past, and future students. Students can quickly go back for a review for upcoming exams. Through feedbacks or comments, teachers can provide answers to students with the problem of clarity.

A teacher needs to know what an educational video is, what makes an excellent educational video, and **how to make an educational video for YouTube** before opening a YouTube channel. Now, let's delve into it!

## Part 1\. What's an Educational Video?

From the name "educational video," you can coin out that it is a video made for the sole purpose of educating or passing out knowledge for the sake of learning. The primary purpose of these videos is to teach an audience about a particular problem or important topics they want to learn about.

Sometimes brands use this method to advertise their brand while being a source of information.

## Part 2\. What Makes a Good Educational Video?

An excellent educational video aids the learning process. It triggers learners in analyzing and evaluating concepts provided by the video. Videos are great educational tools that most teachers must adopt due to their role in facilitating the learning process.

To make a good educational video, you should keep the following points in mind:

* **Keep your students engaged**

An excellent educational video should be eye catchy and exciting to get your student's undivided attention. You can achieve it in any way, one of which is that you need to put yourself into the teaching mode, which means that you should give out the impression of your excitement for the course content you are talking about. Ask them questions, let them feel involved in the process. Please don't go ahead talking with a cold tune. It makes them tired of listening or seeing the video.

* **Be sure to maintain a right-size of video length**

It's better shorter than longer. Have you ever seen a boring, long movie? It's almost the same feeling you get seeing a long educational video.

The video should be straightforward to leverage the advantage of this form of learning. One needs to make this video of the right size for easy assimilation by the learner. Depending on the course topic, your video can be between **2 - 20 minutes** long.

Most importantly, don't try to do much and use more straightforward, understandable concepts.

* **Stay focused**

Making your videos focused and not running around many things helps it pass the information that plays a good role in video length management and engagement. Videos that try to divert from the topic may end up not hitting the nail on the head and not accomplishing their purpose.

* **Center your interest on the student’s needs**

Any educational content should be centered to meet the needs of the students. That goes beyond creating content, but covers the entirety of satisfying the needs of your learners.

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ![Polaroid Cube](https://images.wondershare.com/polaroid-cube.png) | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $100: Polaroid Cube+ Recording outdoor action videos for your vlog with a DSLR camera is impractical. They're heavy and bulky, getting in the way of whatever you're doing. Action cameras like the GoPro and Polaroid Cube are much better for these occasions because they're small enough to be mounted on a bike or a helmet. The Polaroid Cube also has built-in magnets on the top and bottom of the camera, giving you the ability to attach them to most metal surfaces. The camera's 1.4-inch rubber body is resistant to water, shock, and all types of weather and it is capable of capturing footage even under the most extreme weather conditions. The Cube action camera can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and it has a 124-degree wide-angle lens that performs best when it is used for exterior shots. The camera is compatible with microSDHC memory cards that can store up to 128GB of footage. The Cube's battery can record up to 107 minutes before it needs another charge. With the Polaroid Cube+, you can preview or control your camera from your phone because it comes with Wi-Fi connectivity. **PROS** _\- Cheap vlogging camera for outdoor videos_ _\- Multiple mounting options_ **CONS** _\- Low-quality built-in microphone_ _\- No preview screen_                                                                                                                                                            |

| ![Yi 4K](https://images.wondershare.com/yi-4k.png)                 | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $200: Yi 4K If you are looking for an affordable vlogging camera that costs less than $200, then currently the best option for you is the Yi 4K Action Camera. Its 2.19" LCD Gorilla Glass retina touchscreen is resistant to scratches and mild impacts. Much like a lot of action cameras, this camera is equipped with a wide-angle lens, 160-degree to be exact. The camera, however, is not waterproof, and you need to buy additional accessories so you can protect the camera from accidental damage. You can record 120 minutes of 4K footage at 60 fps without having to recharge the camera's 4.35V lithium-ion battery. All the footage you record with the Yi 4K action camera can easily be transferred to a computer or broadcasted live on Facebook, YouTube, and other live streaming platforms using the camera's high-speed 5GHz Wi-Fi feature. The built-in EIS (electronic image stabilization) contains a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer that reduces the camera shakes caused by movements and enables you to produce smooth recordings of your wildest adventures. The Yi 4K action camera has two built-in microphones that can capture audio recordings, but there is no audio jack input for recording audio from an external microphone. **PROS** _\- Weighs only 3.4 Oz_ _\- Powerful electronic image stabilization_ **CONS** _\- Limited mounting capabilities_ _\- The camera's fisheye lens can distort footage_ |
| ![Nikon B500](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-b500.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $300: Nikon B500 Unlike the action cams that can capture ultra-wide-angle shots, the Nikon's Coolpix B500 model is designed to also help you zoom in closer. The camera has a built-in 40X optical zoom NIKKOR lens that can be extended to 80X when used with the Dynamic Fine Zoom feature, which means you can easily record things that are further away. The Nikon Coolpix B500's ISO can only go up to ISO 3200, despite the camera's 16 MP BSI-CMOS sensor that supports full HD 1080p recording at 30 or 25 fps. The 3-inch 920K-dot LCD screen is fully adjustable but it doesn't have touchscreen functionality, and the camera doesn't have a viewfinder, which can slightly complicate the process of composing shots for your vlogs. The Nikon Coolpix B500 is conveniently powered by 4 AA batteries. This cheap vlogging camera offers more features than similar cameras in its price range. **PROS** _\- Great connectivity features_ _\- 80x optical zoom_ **CONS** _\- No manual exposure controls_ _\- Limited ISO sensitivity_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ![Nikon A900](https://images.wondershare.com/nikon-a900.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $400: Nikon A900 This Coolpix series digital camera model is much more powerful than the Nikon B500 because it is a 20.3 MP camera that can record videos in UHD 4K quality. The non-interchangeable 35X optical zoom NIKKOR f/3.4-6.9 lens performs well in capturing footage of both closeup and faraway objects. Like the B500, the A900's ISO sensitivity goes up to a maximum of 3200\. Consequently, this camera won't be ideal for filming in poorly lit conditions. The Nikon Coolpix A900 features a variety of handy modes, including creative, super lapse, and multiple exposure modes, to mention a few. The SnapBridge app allows you to connect the camera to a smartphone or a tablet via the built-in Wi-Fi NFC so you can transfer and edit the footage immediately after you stop recording. The A900 is a small and light digital camera, which makes it a great companion on your daily vlogging adventures. **PROS** _\- 4K and Full HD video recording options_ _\- Manual exposure control_ **CONS** _\- Limited audio recording features_ _\- No viewfinder_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![Sony a5100](https://images.wondershare.com/sony-a5100.png)       | Best Cheap Vlogging Camera Under $500: Sony a5100 Sony's a5100 is the successor of the NEX-5 series. Four years after its initial release in 2014, it is still considered the best vlogging camera under $500. The 24.3 MP Exmor APS-C CMOS sensor and the BIONZ X image processor reduce image noise and increase the level of detail in your vlogs. This mirrorless camera ships with the standard 16-50 mm lens, but it is compatible with all of Sony's E-mount lenses. The Sony a5100 can record up to 1080p videos at 60 fps. Its HVAC S codec support enables you to produce videos that have 50Mbps bit rates. The Hybrid AF system featuring both a 179 phase-detect points as well as 25 contrast-detect points guarantees that all videos you record with the Sony a5100 will be sharp and in focus. Wi-Fi with NFC feature enables you to easily transfer or share your recorded footage. **PROS** _\- AF speeds exceed all expectations_ _\- The camera body is resistant to moderate impact_ **CONS** _\- Can't record 4K videos_ _\- Fake shutter sounds_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
