## Clear Shots for YouTube Filmmakers

# Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube

 When a YouTube video is shaky it’s hard to focus on what is happening in it. Camera shake is a huge distraction and, if it is a persistent problem in your YouTube videos, it will be hard to get subscribers. Shakiness is an easy problem to correct. With a bit of equipment, or a bit of creativity, it is easy to make sure your YouTube videos are nice and smooth.

## Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube

 This article will talk about different types of equipment you can use to stabilize your camera. For vloggers on a budget, there is even one tip on stabilizing your camera without camera equipment. Here are some of the best stabilizers for YouTube videos:

#### Part 1\. Tripod

 A tripod is a three-legged stand you can mount your camera to. The height of a tripod can be adjusted so you can set your camera up at the level that works best for you. Because tripods can stand alone you can set your camera up to record yourself without needing a helper.

 Tripods are the best choice for vlogs that revolve around you standing (or sitting) and delivering information, like opinion or beauty vlogs.

#### Part 2\. Monopod

 A monopod is like a tripod in the sense that you can adjust its height, but unlike a tripod a monopod has only one leg and cannot stand by itself. You will need a helper to stay with your camera if you plan to film yourself using a monopod. A monopod is more portable than a tripod, though, and can be used in a wider variety of places. You can even use a monopod to record aerial shots just by picking it up.

#### Part 3\. Pistol Grip

 A pistol grip is a handle you mount your camera to the top of. You can carry your camera around on top of the pistol grip, or you can mount the grip itself to your tripod or monopod. Once the grip is mounted you can use it to more easily control your camera movements. This is a great way to get even, steady, camera pans.

#### Part 4\. Selfie Stick

 A selfie stick is a long pole you mount your smartphone to one end of in order to take selfies from farther away. Selfie sticks also make great stabilizers if you are shooting video on your smartphone. To stabilize your smartphone place the handle of your selfie stick on the ground as if it were a monopod. When you are shooting using a selfie stick you can also hold it up in the air to get interesting high angle shots.

 Some YouTubers even like to shoot selfie-style vlogs where the hold the selfie stick just like they are taking a photo of themselves.

#### Part 5\. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization

 ‘Optical Image Stabilization’ is fairly new hardware which is built in to a lot of new smartphones, like the iPhone 6S Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. OIS reduces camera shake by a lot, although it is still a good idea to stabilize your smartphone while you record. OIS will also help you take sharper still photos without using any software.

#### Part 6\. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect

 If you do not have equipment, or cannot bring it where you want to shoot, then you can still record steady footage. You just have to get creative with where you put your camera. Any stable surface will do. You can set your camera down on a shelf in your house, a picnic bench, or up in a tree.

 If you are able to lean your elbows onto a desk or table while you hold your camera then that will also significantly cut down on camera shake. This works best for footage you are not in, or which you can have a helper film for you. If you are open to shooting a selfie-style vlog then you can use anything you can rest your hand on, like a fence or a railing.

* Videos are good platforms for viewers to learn in detail. For example, a tutorial video will show clearly the steps to follow for a particular project until success.

#### How to make a good video using Filmora

Using available video editors can help you become among the most subs on YouTube. Filmora comes loaded with editing effects to help you create quality and amazing videos. The user interface is easy to navigate, therefore suiting even beginners. Follow these steps to make a quality video with Filmora.

Step 1\. Launch Filmora
Firstly, download and install Filmora on your computer. Then launch it by double-clicking on the desktop icon. You have two options. Either to create a new project or to open an existing project.

Step 2\. Create a new project  
If you don’t have any project you were using before, you can create a new one. Click the “New Project” option and wait for the editor to load. Also, ensure to register your product by clicking the “Register” button. Then go to the “Project settings” option and select the aspect ratio to use.

Step 3\. Import the footage  
Go to the upper section of the screen and click the “Import” button > “Import Media Files” option. Then go to the section on your computer hard drive where your footage to be edited is stored. Next, select the video and click on the “Import” button.

Step 4\. Organize your material  
Then begin to organize the files you have imported. You can create and use folders to sort out your files from the “My Album” section. Just click on the “Add a New Folder” icon to create a folder and rename it. Then arrange your footage as you wish.

Step 5\. Move your videos to the timeline  
Here is where you can edit your videos freely. Use the drag and drop feature to add them. You can also rearrange your files by dragging the files to the desired position in the timeline. You can then preview your videos by clicking the “Play” tab or using the “Playhead” to jump to a certain portion of the video.

Step 6\. Edit video  
Filmora lets you add effects and modify your video to your satisfaction. You can trim by dragging the end of a video clip on the right or left side. Likewise, you can apply other visual effects like insert transitions, add music, or even detach the audio and video to put background music of choice. More so, it’s easy to add text like opening titles, end credits, and so on to your video. Engage the available templates by dragging and dropping that of your choice to the timeline. Then add the appropriate text in Filmora’s preview window.

Step 7\. Export and Share  
Finally, you can export your video in any format. Just click on the "Export" button, and you'll be redirected to the "Output Window". Select the video file format in the "Format" menu and optimize your video YouTube.
