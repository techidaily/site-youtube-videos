<p>YouTube streaming service is a beehive of activities. Promoters strive for a higher number of subscribers to boost their content. Several ways are available for you to increase the number of subscribers and visitors to your site. YouTube sub for sub is one common practice for this noble cause. In this practice, a person subscribes, in anticipation of the recipient subscribing back as well.</p>
<p>However, the practice may not give your channel that genuine growth. The subscribers may not even watch your videos or care much about leaving comments or other engagements. All in all, the aim is to hit a certain number of subscribers so that you can get into the recommended territory and probably start earning. But are there other options to increase YouTube subscriptions apart from Sub4Sub? Be genuine and use real avenues to rise to the top. This article corresponds adequately on the matter by giving you alternative ways to gain real subscribers who will stick around to grow your channel.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-sub-for-sub"><a href="#What-is-sub-for-sub" class="headerlink" title="What is sub for sub?"></a>What is sub for sub?</h2><p>Subforsub means a subscription for a subscription. In this practice, there are subscribers and subscriptions. Those who subscribe to you on YouTube are the subscribers while those whom you subscribe to, are the subscriptions. Both video makers’ subscribers are, therefore, increased equally and doesn’t give each other a competitive advantage against the other member. Sub for sub was founded in Germany, 4 years ago. It is easy to use and free platform that takes only about 5 minutes to contact a subscriber and complete the initiative. To get started, a user signs up and creates a new account on the home page. You can then reach out to other members for a subscription.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-sub-for-sub-work"><a href="#How-does-sub-for-sub-work" class="headerlink" title="How does sub for sub work?"></a>How does sub for sub work?</h2><p>With YouTube sub for sub, you market your YouTube channel to get more subscribers. Simply sub to one another’s channel and they sub back.</p>
<p>You can do this on different channels such as YouTube live videos, among other channels. But again, these subscribers are not so much concerned about getting the real subs. What matters is that you get 1,000 subscribers to enable you to monetize on YouTube. However, YouTube also has its measures in place, and manipulating the matrix is one of which they don’t advocate for. But in most cases, subforsub participants operate fake YouTube accounts and you can find one person corresponding up to 5 accounts to gain subscriptions. This isn’t good for your rating as you don’t get real subscribers but you only boost the number of subscribers. And since they don’t watch your videos, neither will they share them with other viewers.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-tricks-to-use-sub-for-sub"><a href="#Tips-tricks-to-use-sub-for-sub" class="headerlink" title="Tips &amp; tricks to use sub for sub"></a>Tips &amp; tricks to use sub for sub</h2><p>Subforsub isn’t genuine and all you get is bot subscribers who don’t engage. However, you can use available tricks to gain popularity.</p>
<h4 id="Using-fake-accounts"><a href="#Using-fake-accounts" class="headerlink" title="- Using fake accounts"></a>- Using fake accounts</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-2.png"
                      alt="youtube sub for sub - use fake account"
                ></p>
<p>A user should only run one genuine YouTube account. However, the trick that most subscribers use to gain more subs is by creating other additional fake accounts to gain more subs in return. But again, it is not a guarantee as some subscribers may not sub back to all the accounts.</p>
<h4 id="Subscribers-don’t-watch-the-videos"><a href="#Subscribers-don’t-watch-the-videos" class="headerlink" title="- Subscribers don’t watch the videos"></a>- Subscribers don’t watch the videos</h4><p>Perhaps there is no time for subscribers to watch the potential sub videos before subscribing. Your mission is to gain as many subs as possible even if your watch time doesn’t go up. This doesn’t bring any positivity to your channel rather an increased number of subscribers.</p>
<h4 id="Reach-out-to-friends"><a href="#Reach-out-to-friends" class="headerlink" title="- Reach out to friends"></a>- Reach out to friends</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="youtube sub for sub - reach out to friends"
                ></p>
<p>You can also boost your sub for sub by reaching out to friends to inform them of your channel and ask for subscriptions in return for theirs as well. This, however, could be a slow process as not all your friends will be attracted to what you do.</p>
<h4 id="Don’t-do-subforsub-for-followers"><a href="#Don’t-do-subforsub-for-followers" class="headerlink" title="- Don’t do subforsub for followers"></a>- Don’t do subforsub for followers</h4><p>A subforsub may not give you followers parse. So, don’t get into it for genuine followers. Those who sub to your channel won’t follow you in most cases. Rather, they might unsubscribe after a short duration of time.</p>
<h4 id="Use-channel-branding"><a href="#Use-channel-branding" class="headerlink" title="- Use channel branding"></a>- Use channel branding</h4><p>This trick will glue viewers to your channel. These can include banner art to welcome everyone who clicks into your channel.</p>
<h2 id="Additional-thoughts-Should-we-rely-on-subforsub-to-get-more-subscribers"><a href="#Additional-thoughts-Should-we-rely-on-subforsub-to-get-more-subscribers" class="headerlink" title="Additional thoughts - Should we rely on subforsub to get more subscribers?"></a>Additional thoughts - Should we rely on subforsub to get more subscribers?</h2><p>You should not rely on subforsub as it doesn’t give the real figures but manipulates the outcome. Nonetheless, you need real subscribers to climb the YouTube ladder. That’s the best way to push the YouTube algorithm. There are genuine aspects of gaining subscribers to grow your channel.</p>
<h4 id="Get-to-social-media-platforms"><a href="#Get-to-social-media-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Get to social media platforms"></a>Get to social media platforms</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subforsub-4.png"
                      alt="youtube sub for sub - look for subscriber on social platform"
                ></p>
<p>These include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other sites. Introduce your YouTube channel to your followers and remind them to subscribe. Likewise, demonstrate why your channel is worth subscribing to.</p>
<h4 id="Upload-content-consistently"><a href="#Upload-content-consistently" class="headerlink" title="Upload content consistently"></a>Upload content consistently</h4><p>Ensure your upload schedule is consistent and you’ll see viewers having a reason to subscribe to your channel. Once you introduce your channel with the first video, post a second and third video to build more momentum on your potential subscribers.</p>

                      alt="take advantage of youtube stories to get more subscriber"
                ></p>
<p>Stories can be a good starting point for those who have not subscribed to your content yet despite watching. Short video stories will attract viewers’ attention and want to get more from your channel.</p>
<h4 id="Use-Calls-to-Action"><a href="#Use-Calls-to-Action" class="headerlink" title="Use Calls to Action"></a>Use Calls to Action</h4><p><img

                      alt="cta to get more youtube subscriber"
                ></p>
<p>Ask your audience to subscribe after watching your videos. A great idea is to use animation or graphics to attract the viewers’ attention instantly. Other free options like green screen are also available for use.</p>
<h4 id="Make-it-easy-for-viewers-to-understand-your-channel"><a href="#Make-it-easy-for-viewers-to-understand-your-channel" class="headerlink" title="Make it easy for viewers to understand your channel"></a>Make it easy for viewers to understand your channel</h4><p>You can make it easy by giving your viewers a guided tour. By this, they’ll know where to find important sections like comments. You can also create a channel banner that tells your audience what you do. They’ll soon familiarize themselves with your channel and be friends in no time.</p>
<h4 id="Build-a-relationship-with-your-audience"><a href="#Build-a-relationship-with-your-audience" class="headerlink" title="Build a relationship with your audience"></a>Build a relationship with your audience</h4><p>It is good to connect with your audience in various aspects. Expressing yourself probably in front of a camera has a deeper impact. You can also use illustrations to bring out your points for a quick understanding. Engaging them in the process is the best way to make them feel like they belong and eventually turn into subscribers.</p>
<h4 id="Focus-on-the-video-that’s-working-for-you"><a href="#Focus-on-the-video-that’s-working-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Focus on the video that’s working for you"></a>Focus on the video that’s working for you</h4><p>You should know which video is working and which is not. Judge and put more emphasis on the video that’s working for you. Check out which videos turn viewers into subscribers as that’s your main aim. More so, be creative and innovative.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-sub-for-sub-3"><a href="#What-is-sub-for-sub-3" class="headerlink" title="What is sub for sub?"></a>What is sub for sub?</h2><p>Subforsub means a subscription for a subscription. In this practice, there are subscribers and subscriptions. Those who subscribe to you on YouTube are the subscribers while those whom you subscribe to, are the subscriptions. Both video makers’ subscribers are, therefore, increased equally and doesn’t give each other a competitive advantage against the other member. Sub for sub was founded in Germany, 4 years ago. It is easy to use and free platform that takes only about 5 minutes to contact a subscriber and complete the initiative. To get started, a user signs up and creates a new account on the home page. You can then reach out to other members for a subscription.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-sub-for-sub-work-3"><a href="#How-does-sub-for-sub-work-3" class="headerlink" title="How does sub for sub work?"></a>How does sub for sub work?</h2><p>With YouTube sub for sub, you market your YouTube channel to get more subscribers. Simply sub to one another’s channel and they sub back.</p>
<p>You can do this on different channels such as YouTube live videos, among other channels. But again, these subscribers are not so much concerned about getting the real subs. What matters is that you get 1,000 subscribers to enable you to monetize on YouTube. However, YouTube also has its measures in place, and manipulating the matrix is one of which they don’t advocate for. But in most cases, subforsub participants operate fake YouTube accounts and you can find one person corresponding up to 5 accounts to gain subscriptions. This isn’t good for your rating as you don’t get real subscribers but you only boost the number of subscribers. And since they don’t watch your videos, neither will they share them with other viewers.</p>

However, you can use available tricks to gain popularity.</p>

                      alt="youtube sub for sub - use fake account"
                ></p>
<p>A user should only run one genuine YouTube account. However, the trick that most subscribers use to gain more subs is by creating other additional fake accounts to gain more subs in return. But again, it is not a guarantee as some subscribers may not sub back to all the accounts.</p>
<h4 id="Subscribers-don’t-watch-the-videos-3"><a href="#Subscribers-don’t-watch-the-videos-3" class="headerlink" title="- Subscribers don’t watch the videos"></a>- Subscribers don’t watch the videos</h4><p>Perhaps there is no time for subscribers to watch the potential sub videos before subscribing. Your mission is to gain as many subs as possible even if your watch time doesn’t go up. This doesn’t bring any positivity to your channel rather an increased number of subscribers.</p>
<h4 id="Reach-out-to-friends-3"><a href="#Reach-out-to-friends-3" class="headerlink" title="- Reach out to friends"></a>- Reach out to friends</h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>You can also boost your sub for sub by reaching out to friends to inform them of your channel and ask for subscriptions in return for theirs as well. This, however, could be a slow process as not all your friends will be attracted to what you do.</p>

<h2 id="The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1"><a href="#The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-1" class="headerlink" title="The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging"></a><strong>The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First"><a href="#1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Get Some Experience First"></a><strong>1. Do Get Some Experience First</strong></h4><p>If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Film-Everything"><a href="#2-Don’t-Film-Everything" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Film Everything"></a><strong>2. Don’t Film Everything</strong></h4><p>Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.</p>
<h4 id="3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night"><a href="#3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)"></a><strong>3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)</strong></h4><p>Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.</p>
<p>Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).</p>
<h4 id="4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video"><a href="#4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video"></a><strong>4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video</strong></h4><p>The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.</p>
<h4 id="5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts"><a href="#5-Do-Use-Templates-Presets-Hotkeys-and-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts"></a><strong>5. Do Use Templates, Presets, Hotkeys, and Shortcuts</strong></h4><p>Any chance you have to cut down on your editing time, use it. This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process. Here are <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s hotkeys <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

Don’t Forget to Label Your Content</strong></h4><p>Staying organized is so important, especially as you begin to accumulate more and more footage. It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…</p>
<h4 id="7-Do-Have-A-Goal"><a href="#7-Do-Have-A-Goal" class="headerlink" title="7. Do Have A Goal"></a><strong>7. Do Have A Goal</strong></h4><p>Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.</p>
<h4 id="8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio"><a href="#8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio" class="headerlink" title="8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)"></a><strong>8. Don’t Worry About Equipment (But Be Aware of Bad Audio)</strong></h4><p>You’ve heard it before: you don’t need anything fancy to be a vlogger. If you are looking to increase your toolbox, we have a helpful <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube gear starter guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you. But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.</p>
<p>The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.</p>
<h4 id="9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere"><a href="#9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere" class="headerlink" title="9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere"></a><strong>9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere</strong></h4><p>Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.</p>
<h4 id="10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health"><a href="#10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Neglect Your Health"></a><strong>10. Don’t Neglect Your Health</strong></h4><p>Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?</p>
<h4 id="11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers"><a href="#11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers"></a><strong>11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers</strong></h4><p>By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.</p>
<h4 id="12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience"><a href="#12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience"></a><strong>12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Remember that in the end, you are creating videos for someone else to enjoy. Even though you might be doing the daily vlog for yourself, if you want your viewers to return every day, you have to have an overall mission for your project. Is your message one that is aimed to motivate or do you want to document a journey? Don’t create your content in a vacuum, ask your viewers for feedback so you know how to improve.</p>
<p>Embarking on your daily vlogging adventure is not one to take lightly, but after 1 month, 1 season, or 1 year, you will be able to look back and see all that you have accomplished and feel proud. With the advice from this article, you can properly prepare yourself and enjoy each step of the process. Don’t overthink it, have fun!</p>

<h2 id="Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways-1"><a href="#Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Daily Vlog Anyways?"></a><strong>Why Daily Vlog Anyways?</strong></h2><p> <strong>Build discipline</strong>: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.</p>
<p><strong>Practice more</strong>: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.</p>
<p><strong>Please the YouTube algorithm</strong>: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw" >view velocity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<h2 id="Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways-2"><a href="#Why-Daily-Vlog-Anyways-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Daily Vlog Anyways?"></a><strong>Why Daily Vlog Anyways?</strong></h2><p> <strong>Build discipline</strong>: Like exercising and eating healthy, you have to commit to it and do it regularly in order to see any lasting results. Vlogging is the same. However, if you’re a creator, making videos whenever you feel like it and want to give yourself a kick in the behind, daily vlogging is a practice that will keep you accountable. You have to do it every day. No excuses.</p>
<p><strong>Practice more</strong>: How do the best become the best? They practice… every day. If what you want to do is become the greatest video creator you can be, make the best videos you can make, and build the largest following that you can, then let daily vlogging be your boot camp to reach those goals.</p>
<p><strong>Please the YouTube algorithm</strong>: It’s true, YouTube wants to see that you are consistently posting fresh content. Every new video you upload will have a day or two to impress the algorithm, this metric is often referred to as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/Kj7L%5FfXhifw" >view velocity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. YouTube will give your video a lift, suggesting it to new viewers, if they see that it is being enjoyed. By publishing daily, you increase your chances of attracting more viewers.</p>
<p>Now that you know the benefits, how should you approach it?</p>
<h2 id="The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-3"><a href="#The-Dos-and-Don’ts-of-Daily-Vlogging-3" class="headerlink" title="The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging"></a><strong>The Dos and Don’ts of Daily Vlogging</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First-2"><a href="#1-Do-Get-Some-Experience-First-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Do Get Some Experience First"></a><strong>1. Do Get Some Experience First</strong></h4><p>If you are starting out on YouTube, as in, you made one or two videos make sure you can vlog weekly for a few months before moving to daily. You wouldn’t run a marathon without training; you can hurt yourself if you do. Have an idea of what you are getting yourself into, otherwise, it can burn you out and ruin the joy of video creation for you completely.</p>
<h4 id="2-Don’t-Film-Everything-2"><a href="#2-Don’t-Film-Everything-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Film Everything"></a><strong>2. Don’t Film Everything</strong></h4><p>Having a daily vlog does not mean always having the camera on. Every minute you film is a minute of footage you will have to watch later, a minute you will have to decide whether to cut from your final video. Every second of recorded footage is multiplied in the editing room and it would be impossible for you to meet your daily deadline if you have too much. The key is to start editing as you film, that way, you only film what you need. It doesn’t hurt to have extra footage, but being excessive can waste your time and add little to the final product.</p>
<h4 id="3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night-2"><a href="#3-Do-Plan-Out-Your-Day-Not-Your-Night-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)"></a><strong>3. Do Plan Out Your Day (Not Your Night)</strong></h4><p>Knowing where you need to go, who you are going to see and talk to, where you are going to have lunch, which route you are going to take home, and any other occurrences that can happen during the day will greatly increase your chances of success. A day is long and can be made longer when you have a video on your mind. Wouldn’t it be nice to save some of your decision making energy by having it all planned out? And if you are worried that over planning will reduce serendipitous moments that you want, don’t, your day won’t always go as planned… that’s just life.</p>
<p>Additionally, avoid filming at night. It will become a major stress to your health. Filming at night means pulling all-nighters to publish the next day, and then repeating that daily (nightly).</p>
<h4 id="4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video-2"><a href="#4-Don’t-Spend-too-Long-On-a-Script…-Or-Your-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video"></a><strong>4. Don’t Spend too Long On a Script… Or Your Video</strong></h4><p>The beauty of daily vlog is to speak your mind and show your personality, not to perform a Shakespearean sonnet by heart. You shouldn’t try to memorize a whole script every day. That would be brutal! What you can have is an outline of the key points you want to hit, certain things you want to say, convey, or record to tell your story, knowing where you want certain cuts to happen helps too, but don’t workshop it too long, because tomorrow will be another show and done is better than perfect.</p>

This means creating and properly storing templates of visuals you want to incorporate into your video. This means adding presets for effects that you feel you would use again. This means learning the editing hotkeys so you can streamline your process.

It might seem tedious initially, but this good habit can save you a lot of wasted hours later on when you need to find that specific shot that you swore you had…</p>
<h4 id="7-Do-Have-A-Goal-2"><a href="#7-Do-Have-A-Goal-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Do Have A Goal"></a><strong>7. Do Have A Goal</strong></h4><p>Have an idea of how long you are going to be going daily. Will it be one month, two months, or a year? Or will it be until you reach a certain amount of views, subscribers, or watch time? While it might feel liberating to venture into the great unknown without a clear destination, having a goal will allow you to keep motivated even when times are hard. After all, once you’ve hit your goal and still feel like there is more fuel in you, keep daily vlogging. There is no better feeling than exceeding your own expectations.</p>
<h4 id="8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio-2"><a href="#8-Don’t-Worry-About-Equipment-But-Be-Aware-of-Bad-Audio-2" class="headerlink" title="8.

But look at it this way, there will be days when you realized that you forgot to charge the battery on your camera or that you left your tripod at home. Don’t abandon the whole project simply because you don’t have what you need.</p>
<p>The important thing is to film, tell a story, edit, and upload. You can do all that on your smartphone or computer webcam if you have to, so don’t let your equipment or lack thereof break your streak. If there is one thing you should put attention on is audio, if you don’t have excellent gear, try to avoid filming in loud places, such as construction sites, dance halls, or highway overpasses.</p>
<h4 id="9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere-2"><a href="#9-Do-Bring-a-Camera-With-You-Everywhere-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere"></a><strong>9. Do Bring a Camera With You Everywhere</strong></h4><p>Although you shouldn’t worry about your equipment, it is still a good habit to carry your camera with you everywhere. From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep you are a daily vlogger, you never know when something will happen. Always be prepared. Your camera is to you, as a gun is to a soldier. It’s what sets you apart from all the civilians, so keep it close at hand.</p>
<h4 id="10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health-2"><a href="#10-Don’t-Neglect-Your-Health-2" class="headerlink" title="10. Don’t Neglect Your Health"></a><strong>10. Don’t Neglect Your Health</strong></h4><p>Earlier I compared daily vlogging to running a marathon, and like a marathon, there is a point where you need to be aware of yourself. You want to push yourself, but you don’t want to overdo it to a point where you damage your physical or mental health. Only you know when you have gone too far. If you feel like daily vlogging is ruining your life and the goal you set for yourself isn’t something you desire anymore, ask yourself: can I take a week off and decide if video creating is something I want to continue?</p>
<h4 id="11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers-2"><a href="#11-Do-Watch-Other-Daily-Vloggers-2" class="headerlink" title="11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers"></a><strong>11. Do Watch Other Daily Vloggers</strong></h4><p>By seeing how other YouTubers have done daily vlogs, you can get ideas, see what aspect of their videos you like or dislike, and learn from their presentation, content, and community engagement. By watching daily vloggers, you can also start interacting with their content as well. It is always easier to stay motivated when you have support. By watching and reaching out to the daily vloggers you enjoy, you can build a network of people who are going through the same journey as you.</p>
<h4 id="12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience-2"><a href="#12-Don’t-Forget-About-Your-Audience-2" class="headerlink" title="12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience"></a><strong>12. Don’t Forget About Your Audience</strong></h4><p>Remember that in the end, you are creating videos for someone else to enjoy. Even though you might be doing the daily vlog for yourself, if you want your viewers to return every day, you have to have an overall mission for your project. Is your message one that is aimed to motivate or do you want to document a journey? Don’t create your content in a vacuum, ask your viewers for feedback so you know how to improve.</p>
<p>Embarking on your daily vlogging adventure is not one to take lightly, but after 1 month, 1 season, or 1 year, you will be able to look back and see all that you have accomplished and feel proud. With the advice from this article, you can properly prepare yourself and enjoy each step of the process. Don’t overthink it, have fun!</p>
