<p>As a content creator, you might be tempted to know how much you can expect to earn through AdSense. Since it’s a free and simple way to make extra bucks, showing ads with the content you produce for online platforms, it’s essential to know how much it pays for views.</p>
<h3 id="Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense"><a href="#Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense"></a>Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense</h3><p>For 1,000 views, expect AdSense to pay around $8-$20. However, your total earnings will depend on factors such as your content type, users’ location, and setting of ads in Google AdSense, so it can pay on thousand views.</p>
<p>More so, AdSense opts for Revenue Per 1,000 impressions or (RPM) to showcase the amount you would get for 1,000 impressions. Remember, this RPM doesn’t include the actual amount you’ve earned. But it focuses on dividing your earnings by page views and impressions, then multiplying those by 1,000.</p>
<p>You can also refer to the formula for better understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515" >RPM &#x3D; (Estimated earnings &#x2F; Number of page views) * 1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>From this formula provided by Google official, we can easily know that</p>
<p>Estimated earnings &#x3D; (RPM * Number of page views) &#x2F; 1000</p>
<p>To understand it further, see the example below.</p>
<p>Suppose you’ve earned around $0.10 from 20 page views; your page RPM would be $6.00 in simpler terms.</p>
<p>($0.10 &#x2F; 25) * 1000 &#x3D; $6.00</p>
<p>Also, if RPM is $4.00 from 45,000 ad impressions, your estimated earnings would be equal $180.00</p>
<p>($4.00 * 45,000) &#x2F; 1000 &#x3D; $180.00</p>
<h3 id="AdSense-Pay-Per-View"><a href="#AdSense-Pay-Per-View" class="headerlink" title="AdSense Pay Per View"></a>AdSense Pay Per View</h3><p>Lastly, if you’re looking for an exact answer regarding how much it pays per view, know that it varies and is based on different factors, such as niche or audience demographic.</p>
<p>But you can expect something between $8 to $12 on 1,000 views after monetizing your YouTube channel with your Google AdSense account.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?"></a>Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?</h2><p><img

                      alt="pay per click"
                ></p>
<p>After understanding AdSense’s way to pay for 1,000 views, formula, or pay per view, here’s what you need to know about AdSense’s payment on per click policy.</p>
<p>On Average, you can expect AdSense to pay something around $0.20 to $15 on a click. Talking about estimated earnings or one click, it depends on the cost-per-click in the niche, including the publisher’s earnings and competition among rival advertisers.</p>
<p>And if you’re wondering, cost-per-click is when a user clicks on your ad, and you earn money for it. However, advertisers always decide the cost-per-click for ads. In this case, some advertisers don’t hesitate to pay extra, depending on what they intend to advertise.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples"><a href="#Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples"></a>Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples</h2><p>From pay per 1,000 views to pay per click, understanding the AdSense payment policy is essential if you’re up to monetize your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Since there’re YouTube AdSense requirements, such as audience demographic, niche, or content, learning about which niche is the lucrative one will also help you decide your next move.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the following examples for better understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if arts and entertainment is your niche, you can expect to earn <strong>$5.62</strong> after accumulating 1,000 pageviews.</li>
<li>Creators who create content on vehicles can earn <strong>around $9.20</strong> on every 1,000 pageviews.</li>
<li>If you’re into beauty and fitness, expect to earn <strong>up to $13.01</strong> on 1,000 pageviews.</li>
<li>For real estate, health, home, and garden niches, you can earn <strong>$14.50, $17.40</strong>, and $23.35 on every 1,000 pageviews.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, people from North America can make the most of these earnings. But worry not if you are based outside North America. Because Google AdSense revenue calculator can help you find the average pageviews on monthly basis.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider"><a href="#Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider"></a>Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider</h2><p>After learning how much you can earn in different niches, it’s equally important to focus on the following factors, so you can qualify and start earning from AdSense with ease.</p>
<h3 id="1-Type-of-Content"><a href="#1-Type-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="1) Type of Content"></a>1) Type of Content</h3><p>To monetize your videos for AdSense, ensure that you own the rights to use visuals and audio elements of your video. And focus on creating all elements of your video yourself.</p>
<p>For YouTube, you can try creating tutorials, do-it-yourself videos, original short films, original music videos, home videos, travel vlogs, or even daily-life vlogs.</p>
<p>While creating content for YouTube, remember advertisers consider placing ads on more advertiser-friendly content.</p>
<p>As a blogger, you must provide unique but quality content to exceed AdSense’s eligibility criteria. Having unique content helps Google understand what your website is about. It’s even better if your website provides a one-of-its-kind experience and users visit it again.</p>
<p>Be it a vlog or blog, please ensure that it’s original and not a copy from other sources. This way, you can elevate your credibility on the respective platforms. For a great user experience, opt for intuitive navigation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-3.jpg"
                      alt="adsense calculator"
                ></p>
<p>And to up your content game, you can even use the calculator to determine the value of your content and estimated revenue from AdSense.</p>
<h3 id="2-Keywords"><a href="#2-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="2) Keywords"></a>2) Keywords</h3><p>Keywords are phrases and words that describe your service or product. The ones you choose will help show your ads to users.</p>
<p>Therefore, go for the relevant yet high-quality keywords and add them to your ad campaigns. This strategy will put your ad in front of potential buyers.</p>
<h3 id="3-User-Location"><a href="#3-User-Location" class="headerlink" title="3) User Location"></a>3) User Location</h3><p>Remember, AdSense follows geo-targeting strategy, so it can place ads on different pages. These ads are based on a user’s language, region, and IP address.</p>
<p>Put simply, ads serving to a user from Algeria may differ from the ads for a user from Georgia.</p>
<h3 id="4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views"><a href="#4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views" class="headerlink" title="4) Time Requires to Get Views"></a>4) Time Requires to Get Views</h3><p>There’s no fixed time frame; however, you can focus on search volume, audience, and competition to start getting the desired number of views.</p>
<p>The first 60 minutes are crucial after you post a video. Then, the next 24 hours and the first 48 hours are equally important because YouTube gives an unnatural boost to it. It helps YouTube observe responses, such as how viewers interacted with the video and what kinds of viewers were interested in it.</p>
<p>Remember, if a video fails to get any views in a couple of days, it won’t likely perform and will consider “dead” on the platform.</p>
<p>More so, if a video performs better slightly, it’ll start to reach its full potential in the next 3 to 6 months, according to the views it receives per day. Oftentimes, videos took up to a year to perform well.</p>
<p>And if your video starts to perform better and faster in those 3-6 months, it’ll likely do better in the longer run.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Duration"><a href="#5-Video-Duration" class="headerlink" title="5) Video Duration"></a>5) Video Duration</h3><p>Focus on the length of your video, as it determines how many ads can be shown in it. This part also influences your earning potential. When your video is longer in length, it’ll increase its worth.</p>
<p>However, you must find the right balance between video duration, quality, and the number of videos on your channel, so you can continue to earn without hindrance.</p>
<h3 id="6-Your-Niche-or-Industry"><a href="#6-Your-Niche-or-Industry" class="headerlink" title="6) Your Niche or Industry"></a>6) Your Niche or Industry</h3><p>Niche is another essential factor to opt for AdSense earnings. Some of the profitable topics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Investment</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Online Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose the area that interest you the most and start people educating about it.</p>
<p>For example, people tend to think about investing their money to multiply it. You can create videos on investment-related topics, tips and tricks to get maximum views.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Pros-and-Cons-of-Earning-Money-from-Google-AdSense"><a href="#Part-5-Pros-and-Cons-of-Earning-Money-from-Google-AdSense" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Pros and Cons of Earning Money from Google AdSense"></a>Part 5: Pros and Cons of Earning Money from Google AdSense</h2><p>At this point, you’re familiar with almost all aspects of generating money using Google AdSense.

<p>Part 1: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per 1,000 Views</p>

<p>As a content creator, you might be tempted to know how much you can expect to earn through AdSense. Since it’s a free and simple way to make extra bucks, showing ads with the content you produce for online platforms, it’s essential to know how much it pays for views.</p>
<h3 id="Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense-1"><a href="#Pay-Per-1-000-Views-by-AdSense-1" class="headerlink" title="Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense"></a>Pay Per 1,000 Views by AdSense</h3><p>For 1,000 views, expect AdSense to pay around $8-$20. However, your total earnings will depend on factors such as your content type, users’ location, and setting of ads in Google AdSense, so it can pay on thousand views.</p>
<p>More so, AdSense opts for Revenue Per 1,000 impressions or (RPM) to showcase the amount you would get for 1,000 impressions. Remember, this RPM doesn’t include the actual amount you’ve earned. But it focuses on dividing your earnings by page views and impressions, then multiplying those by 1,000.</p>
<p>You can also refer to the formula for better understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/190515" >RPM &#x3D; (Estimated earnings &#x2F; Number of page views) * 1000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>From this formula provided by Google official, we can easily know that</p>
<p>Estimated earnings &#x3D; (RPM * Number of page views) &#x2F; 1000</p>
<p>To understand it further, see the example below.</p>
<p>Suppose you’ve earned around $0.10 from 20 page views; your page RPM would be $6.00 in simpler terms.</p>
<p>($0.10 &#x2F; 25) * 1000 &#x3D; $6.00</p>
<p>Also, if RPM is $4.00 from 45,000 ad impressions, your estimated earnings would be equal $180.00</p>
<p>($4.00 * 45,000) &#x2F; 1000 &#x3D; $180.00</p>
<h3 id="AdSense-Pay-Per-View-1"><a href="#AdSense-Pay-Per-View-1" class="headerlink" title="AdSense Pay Per View"></a>AdSense Pay Per View</h3><p>Lastly, if you’re looking for an exact answer regarding how much it pays per view, know that it varies and is based on different factors, such as niche or audience demographic.</p>
<p>But you can expect something between $8 to $12 on 1,000 views after monetizing your YouTube channel with your Google AdSense account.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Does-AdSense-Pay-Per-Click-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?"></a>Part 2: How Much Does AdSense Pay Per Click?</h2><p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-2.jpg"

                ></p>
<p>After understanding AdSense’s way to pay for 1,000 views, formula, or pay per view, here’s what you need to know about AdSense’s payment on per click policy.</p>
<p>On Average, you can expect AdSense to pay something around $0.20 to $15 on a click. Talking about estimated earnings or one click, it depends on the cost-per-click in the niche, including the publisher’s earnings and competition among rival advertisers.</p>
<p>And if you’re wondering, cost-per-click is when a user clicks on your ad, and you earn money for it. However, advertisers always decide the cost-per-click for ads. In this case, some advertisers don’t hesitate to pay extra, depending on what they intend to advertise.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-3-AdSense-Earnings-Per-Thousand-Pageviews-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples"></a>Part 3: AdSense Earnings Per Thousand Pageviews Examples</h2><p>From pay per 1,000 views to pay per click, understanding the AdSense payment policy is essential if you’re up to monetize your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Since there’re YouTube AdSense requirements, such as audience demographic, niche, or content, learning about which niche is the lucrative one will also help you decide your next move.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the following examples for better understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if arts and entertainment is your niche, you can expect to earn <strong>$5.62</strong> after accumulating 1,000 pageviews.</li>
<li>Creators who create content on vehicles can earn <strong>around $9.20</strong> on every 1,000 pageviews.</li>
<li>If you’re into beauty and fitness, expect to earn <strong>up to $13.01</strong> on 1,000 pageviews.</li>
<li>For real estate, health, home, and garden niches, you can earn <strong>$14.50, $17.40</strong>, and $23.35 on every 1,000 pageviews.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, people from North America can make the most of these earnings. But worry not if you are based outside North America. Because Google AdSense revenue calculator can help you find the average pageviews on monthly basis.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider-1"><a href="#Part-4-Earnings-from-AdSense-Factors-to-Consider-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider"></a>Part 4: Earnings from AdSense: Factors to Consider</h2><p>After learning how much you can earn in different niches, it’s equally important to focus on the following factors, so you can qualify and start earning from AdSense with ease.</p>
<h3 id="1-Type-of-Content-1"><a href="#1-Type-of-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="1) Type of Content"></a>1) Type of Content</h3><p>To monetize your videos for AdSense, ensure that you own the rights to use visuals and audio elements of your video. And focus on creating all elements of your video yourself.</p>
<p>For YouTube, you can try creating tutorials, do-it-yourself videos, original short films, original music videos, home videos, travel vlogs, or even daily-life vlogs.</p>
<p>While creating content for YouTube, remember advertisers consider placing ads on more advertiser-friendly content.</p>
<p>As a blogger, you must provide unique but quality content to exceed AdSense’s eligibility criteria. Having unique content helps Google understand what your website is about. It’s even better if your website provides a one-of-its-kind experience and users visit it again.</p>
<p>Be it a vlog or blog, please ensure that it’s original and not a copy from other sources. This way, you can elevate your credibility on the respective platforms. For a great user experience, opt for intuitive navigation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-does-adsense-pay-per-1000-views-3.jpg"
                      alt="adsense calculator"
                ></p>
<p>And to up your content game, you can even use the calculator to determine the value of your content and estimated revenue from AdSense.</p>
<h3 id="2-Keywords-1"><a href="#2-Keywords-1" class="headerlink" title="2) Keywords"></a>2) Keywords</h3><p>Keywords are phrases and words that describe your service or product. The ones you choose will help show your ads to users.</p>
<p>Therefore, go for the relevant yet high-quality keywords and add them to your ad campaigns. This strategy will put your ad in front of potential buyers.</p>
<h3 id="3-User-Location-1"><a href="#3-User-Location-1" class="headerlink" title="3) User Location"></a>3) User Location</h3><p>Remember, AdSense follows geo-targeting strategy, so it can place ads on different pages. These ads are based on a user’s language, region, and IP address.</p>
<p>Put simply, ads serving to a user from Algeria may differ from the ads for a user from Georgia.</p>
<h3 id="4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views-1"><a href="#4-Time-Requires-to-Get-Views-1" class="headerlink" title="4) Time Requires to Get Views"></a>4) Time Requires to Get Views</h3><p>There’s no fixed time frame; however, you can focus on search volume, audience, and competition to start getting the desired number of views.</p>
<p>The first 60 minutes are crucial after you post a video. Then, the next 24 hours and the first 48 hours are equally important because YouTube gives an unnatural boost to it. It helps YouTube observe responses, such as how viewers interacted with the video and what kinds of viewers were interested in it.</p>
<p>Remember, if a video fails to get any views in a couple of days, it won’t likely perform and will consider “dead” on the platform.</p>
<p>More so, if a video performs better slightly, it’ll start to reach its full potential in the next 3 to 6 months, according to the views it receives per day. Oftentimes, videos took up to a year to perform well.</p>
<p>And if your video starts to perform better and faster in those 3-6 months, it’ll likely do better in the longer run.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Duration-1"><a href="#5-Video-Duration-1" class="headerlink" title="5) Video Duration"></a>5) Video Duration</h3><p>Focus on the length of your video, as it determines how many ads can be shown in it. This part also influences your earning potential. When your video is longer in length, it’ll increase its worth.</p>
<p>However, you must find the right balance between video duration, quality, and the number of videos on your channel, so you can continue to earn without hindrance.</p>
<h3 id="6-Your-Niche-or-Industry-1"><a href="#6-Your-Niche-or-Industry-1" class="headerlink" title="6) Your Niche or Industry"></a>6) Your Niche or Industry</h3><p>Niche is another essential factor to opt for AdSense earnings. Some of the profitable topics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Investment</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Online Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose the area that interest you the most and start people educating about it.</p>
<p>For example, people tend to think about investing their money to multiply it. You can create videos on investment-related topics, tips and tricks to get maximum views.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Pros-and-Cons-of-Earning-Money-from-Google-AdSense-1"><a href="#Part-5-Pros-and-Cons-of-Earning-Money-from-Google-AdSense-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Pros and Cons of Earning Money from Google AdSense"></a>Part 5: Pros and Cons of Earning Money from Google AdSense</h2><p>At this point, you’re familiar with almost all aspects of generating money using Google AdSense. And considering the factors, it seems like a task you can perform.</p>
<p>Before you try earning money via AdSense, consider the following pros and cons.</p>
<p> Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Google AdSense doesn’t charge an extra fee. It’s a totally free service that can help you earn dollars.</li>

<li>You need a lot of traffic to make some serious money.</li>
<li>Adding several ads can annoy your viewers.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you enter your YouTube Creator Studio, you will find the Analytics Tab on the left-hand-side menu. Click into it and you will see a whole list of features, each linking to its own dashboard.</p>

<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>

<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>

                      alt="data-of-specific-period"
                ></p>
<p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p>

I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>
<p><strong>2. Realtime</strong></p>

<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>

<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

<p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p>

Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>
<p><img

<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img

                >  </p>
<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-Audience-Retention"><a href="#How-to-Use-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Use Audience Retention</strong></h4><p>Audience retention can give you a lot of insights on how you should be structuring your videos. If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>7. Demographics</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understand the Average Age and Gender of Your Audience</strong></p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>
<p><strong>11. Translations</strong></p>
<p> <strong>See If You Need to Include Multi-Languages or Translation to Your Videos</strong></p>
<p>The Translations report is where you can see how your viewers are watching your videos in terms of using translations and subtitles.</p>
<p>If you are creating content that targets international viewers, it’s good to know if they are engaging with your translation assets, including subtitles.</p>
<p>For example, if you see an increase in viewers from Brazil, do a quick translation of your transcript and upload the Portuguese subtitles and see if it increases viewers.</p>

<p>As a YouTuber, you know those famous metrics: Views, Subscribers, and Watch Time. Those YouTube analytics are easy to understand. But YouTube offers much more data.</p>
<p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p>

<p>When you enter your YouTube Creator Studio, you will find the Analytics Tab on the left-hand-side menu. Click into it and you will see a whole list of features, each linking to its own dashboard.</p>

<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-1"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p>
<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>

                      alt="data-of-specific-period"
                ></p>
<p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p>

I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>
<p><strong>2. Realtime</strong></p>

<p>If you have recently shared a new video, you should log into the Realtime dashboard to get a quick glance at the performance.</p>

<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Revenue</strong></p>

Consider how these videos are successful:</p>
<p>- Was the content great?</p>
<p>- Was it the perfect length?</p>
<p>- Was it a well-structured video?</p>
<p>- Was the video’s pacing fast?</p>
<p> Once you’ve done a full evaluation, see if you can apply it to your other videos.</p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>

<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

<p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p>

Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>

<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>

It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Television producers pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to data companies to get the same set of analytics that YouTube offers its creators for free.</p>
<p>Learning how to use analytics is not always a skill YouTubers think about when they are making videos, but it plays such an instrumental part throughout the whole stage of creation, from ideation to distribution.</p>
<p>Understanding how your videos are performing shines a light on your process, helps you evaluate what is working and what isn’t, and empower you to think beyond the lens and create videos that really resonates with your growing audience.</p>

<p>As a YouTuber, you know those famous metrics: Views, Subscribers, and Watch Time. Those YouTube analytics are easy to understand. But YouTube offers much more data.</p>
<p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p>

<p>When you enter your YouTube Creator Studio, you will find the Analytics Tab on the left-hand-side menu. Click into it and you will see a whole list of features, each linking to its own dashboard.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-2"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-2" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p>
<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="Personalize-Your-Overview-2"><a href="#Personalize-Your-Overview-2" class="headerlink" title="Personalize Your Overview"></a><strong>Personalize Your Overview</strong></h4><p>By default, the dashboard will show you the stats from the last 28 days, but you can personalize the time frame to see the data of that specific period.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="data-of-specific-period"
                ></p>
<p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                >  </p>
<p>Note: You will be able to change the time frame and region for all the data within YouTube Analytics.</p>
<h4 id="See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview-2"><a href="#See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview-2" class="headerlink" title="See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview"></a><strong>See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard highlights your Top 10 videos.

<h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard-2"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Overview Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Overview Dashboard</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard is your mission control. I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>
<p><strong>2. Realtime</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel-2"><a href="#See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel-2" class="headerlink" title="See The Performance of Your Channel"></a><strong>See The Performance of Your Channel</strong></h4><p>The Realtime report is a fantastic tool for seeing the immediate performance of your channel, which automatically updates every 10 seconds. There are two main views: The last 48 hours and the Last 60 Minutes.</p>

<p>If you have recently shared a new video, you should log into the Realtime dashboard to get a quick glance at the performance.</p>

<h4 id="See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment-2"><a href="#See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment-2" class="headerlink" title="See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment"></a><strong>See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment</strong></h4><p>If you want to find out how many people have viewed your videos from a mobile device or how big your audience currently is, you can do that in the Realtime report.</p>
<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard-2"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Realtime Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Realtime Dashboard</strong></h4><p>If YouTube sees that your recently published video is performing well right off the bat, then it will give your video a better chance of trending, ranking higher in search, and reaching more viewers.</p>
<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Revenue</strong></p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ad Rates</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understanding the Ad Rates Report</strong></p>

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>
<h4 id="See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-2"><a href="#See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-2" class="headerlink" title="See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue"></a><strong>See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue</strong></h4><p>Unlike the Revenue dashboard, the Ad Rates report dives deeper into the performance of individual monetized videos.</p>
<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

You want to make videos, and not worry too much about ads, after all.</p>
<p>But as you accumulate more and more monetized videos, and you will start seeing which videos are stronger in getting you ad engagements and which aren’t. The result might surprise you and help inform your next phase of videos.</p>
<p><strong>5. Watch Time</strong></p>

Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>
<p><img

<p>In the graph, you will also be able to see the combined Views of all your videos, as well as the segmented performance of YouTube Red viewers.</p>
<p>YouTube Red is YouTube’s subscription plan. It is currently only available in Australia, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.</p>
<p>YouTube Red offers ad-free content that can be enjoyed offline. Since the viewers with YouTube Red won’t see ads, YouTube will give you partial revenue from Red viewers.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                >  </p>
<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-2"><a href="#How-to-Use-Audience-Retention-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Use Audience Retention</strong></h4><p>Audience retention can give you a lot of insights on how you should be structuring your videos. If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Knowing this, for the next video you make, you can better anticipate where your viewers are going to need more time on a specific part or whether you should skip ahead to something more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>7. Demographics</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understand the Average Age and Gender of Your Audience</strong></p>

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>
<p><strong>11. Translations</strong></p>
<p> <strong>See If You Need to Include Multi-Languages or Translation to Your Videos</strong></p>
<p>The Translations report is where you can see how your viewers are watching your videos in terms of using translations and subtitles.</p>
<p>If you are creating content that targets international viewers, it’s good to know if they are engaging with your translation assets, including subtitles.</p>
<p>For example, if you see an increase in viewers from Brazil, do a quick translation of your transcript and upload the Portuguese subtitles and see if it increases viewers.</p>

<p>One of these elements is the Best for Viewer, which allows YouTube to determine which of your video is best to present to the viewer in relation to their browsing history and interests.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Television producers pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to data companies to get the same set of analytics that YouTube offers its creators for free.</p>
<p>Learning how to use analytics is not always a skill YouTubers think about when they are making videos, but it plays such an instrumental part throughout the whole stage of creation, from ideation to distribution.</p>
<p>Understanding how your videos are performing shines a light on your process, helps you evaluate what is working and what isn’t, and empower you to think beyond the lens and create videos that really resonates with your growing audience.</p>

<p>As a YouTuber, you know those famous metrics: Views, Subscribers, and Watch Time. Those YouTube analytics are easy to understand. But YouTube offers much more data.</p>
<p>YouTube data is valuable because it can show you why you aren’t getting more subscribers and why certain videos aren’t getting the views you expected. Data can also identify all the positive results and give you insights into what worked.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to show you how to use YouTube Analytics to gain knowledge, take action, and grow your channel.</p>

<p>When you enter your YouTube Creator Studio, you will find the Analytics Tab on the left-hand-side menu. Click into it and you will see a whole list of features, each linking to its own dashboard.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>But with all this information, it can get a little overwhelming for new YouTubers. Don’t sweat. Let’s walk through each section to identify:</p>
<p>- What information it is displaying</p>
<p>- What issues it addresses</p>
<p>- What you can do to improve the results</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<h4 id="Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-3"><a href="#Use-Overview-Report-for-Quick-Analysis-3" class="headerlink" title="Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis"></a><strong>Use Overview Report for Quick Analysis</strong></h4><p>The Overview report is the first page you land on when you click into Analytics, and it’s what you want to see when you are checking in.</p>
<p>The Overview dashboard breaks down all your key stats. If you want a deeper dive, you can click into each of the section headers and it will give you an in-depth look at the analytics of that specific category.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="Personalize-Your-Overview-3"><a href="#Personalize-Your-Overview-3" class="headerlink" title="Personalize Your Overview"></a><strong>Personalize Your Overview</strong></h4><p>By default, the dashboard will show you the stats from the last 28 days, but you can personalize the time frame to see the data of that specific period.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="data-of-specific-period"
                ></p>
<p> If you only want to focus on the performance of your channel on a specific region, you can customize that as well:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="data-of-specific-region"
                >  </p>
<p>Note: You will be able to change the time frame and region for all the data within YouTube Analytics.</p>
<h4 id="See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview-3"><a href="#See-Your-Top-Performing-Videos-In-Overview-3" class="headerlink" title="See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview"></a><strong>See Your Top Performing Videos In Overview</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard highlights your Top 10 videos. Right away you can see the Watch Time, Views, and Estimated Revenue of those high performing videos.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard-3"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Overview-Dashboard-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Overview Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Overview Dashboard</strong></h4><p>The Overview dashboard is your mission control. I recommend popping in weekly to get a top view of your channel’s performance.</p>
<p>If you notice anything unusual or surprising, such as a spike in Shares, you can then dig into the individual data and identify the cause.</p>
<p><strong>2. Realtime</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel-3"><a href="#See-The-Performance-of-Your-Channel-3" class="headerlink" title="See The Performance of Your Channel"></a><strong>See The Performance of Your Channel</strong></h4><p>The Realtime report is a fantastic tool for seeing the immediate performance of your channel, which automatically updates every 10 seconds. There are two main views: The last 48 hours and the Last 60 Minutes.</p>

<p>If you have recently shared a new video, you should log into the Realtime dashboard to get a quick glance at the performance.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h4 id="See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment-3"><a href="#See-How-and-Where-Your-Videos-Are-Being-Viewed-At-the-Moment-3" class="headerlink" title="See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment"></a><strong>See How and Where Your Videos Are Being Viewed At the Moment</strong></h4><p>If you want to find out how many people have viewed your videos from a mobile device or how big your audience currently is, you can do that in the Realtime report.</p>
<p>- Select Device to see if you have more viewers on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet.</p>
<p>- Select Operating System to find out if you have more Android viewers or iOS viewers in the past two days.</p>
<p>- Select Geography to see which region you are getting the most views and when viewerships are dropping because most likely people in that area are sleeping.</p>
<p> If you notice that you are getting a lot of views from the US, but also notice that people are about to go to sleep and the trend shows that it drops at that point in the past 24 hours, you can decide whether to schedule the post for the next morning or you can see if a boost at this point can keep the audience awake.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard-3"><a href="#How-to-Use-the-Realtime-Dashboard-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Use the Realtime Dashboard"></a><strong>How to Use the Realtime Dashboard</strong></h4><p>If YouTube sees that your recently published video is performing well right off the bat, then it will give your video a better chance of trending, ranking higher in search, and reaching more viewers.</p>
<p>Getting early insights on a recently published video may help you adjust your promotion strategy as needed.</p>
<p>For example, if you published a video this morning and shared it on your Facebook page, and you checked in this morning and saw that there was only a small amount of views, you may want to share it on a different platform so that it can get more exposure.</p>
<p><strong>3. Revenue</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Much-Money-Your-Channel-Has-Made-3"><a href="#See-How-Much-Money-Your-Channel-Has-Made-3" class="headerlink" title="See How Much Money Your Channel Has Made"></a><strong>See How Much Money Your Channel Has Made</strong></h4><p>Select a specific timeline and see how much your channel has made from ads and YouTube Red viewers during that duration.</p>

<p>You can also change how you view your data, whether Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc. This way you can see exactly how much you made each day, week, or month, and determine if you can correlate a particular dip or spike to an event that occurred.</p>

Consider how these videos are successful:</p>
<p>- Was the content great?</p>
<p>- Was it the perfect length?</p>
<p>- Was it a well-structured video?</p>
<p>- Was the video’s pacing fast?</p>
<p> Once you’ve done a full evaluation, see if you can apply it to your other videos.</p>

Click into Geography and see how much you are making in different countries and consider which audience is best to focus your attention on with the intention of increasing revenue.</p>
<h4 id="Compare-Estimated-Revenue-Earning-to-Other-Metrics-3"><a href="#Compare-Estimated-Revenue-Earning-to-Other-Metrics-3" class="headerlink" title="Compare Estimated Revenue Earning to Other Metrics"></a><strong>Compare Estimated Revenue Earning to Other Metrics</strong></h4><p>Know more about how your data are related by comparing to see if Revenue is affected by the performance of metrics in other categories such as Views. Does a rise in view change your revenue?</p>

<p>As you can see in the example in the graph from the section above, the View count has been fairly consistent, however, the Revenue is sporadic.</p>
<p>This tells you that while Views may be an important metric, it won’t affect your revenue. This can mean that you haven’t been reaching the audience that will engage with the ads, consider a slight content shift.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ad Rates</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Understanding the Ad Rates Report</strong></p>
<p><img

<p><strong>YouTube Ad Revenue:</strong> This is the estimated gross total of all the money you made from ads sold via Google and Google partners.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Monetized Playbacks:</strong> This is the number of times your audience is shown an ad.</p>
<p><strong>Playback-based CPM:</strong> This is an estimation from YouTube on how much money you can make if you had 1,000 views from a monetized video. This is based on the parameters of the advertisers, your current number of views, and where your viewers are from.</p>
<p><strong>CPM:</strong> This is the estimated amount you will earn for 1,000 ad impressions.</p>
<h4 id="See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-3"><a href="#See-Which-Monetized-Videos-Are-Earning-Your-Ad-Revenue-3" class="headerlink" title="See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue"></a><strong>See Which Monetized Videos Are Earning Your Ad Revenue</strong></h4><p>Unlike the Revenue dashboard, the Ad Rates report dives deeper into the performance of individual monetized videos.</p>
<p>This allows you to not only see the estimated earnings but also how many times the ad was shown. On top of that, the CPM gives you an idea of what YouTube deems to be more valuable content for advertisers, which gives you a better idea about the capabilities of the video and offers insight into the type of videos you make in the future.</p>

Overall, you’ll want to see a steady rise for your Watch Time as it will indicate that you have a growing dedicated viewership.</p>

Always consider ways in which you can improve this metric.</p>
<p>Some strategies include:</p>
<p>- Add videos to optimized playlists</p>
<p>- Improving titles and thumbnails</p>
<p>- Increase YouTube subscribers</p>
<p>- Add annotations to your videos</p>
<p>- Add end cards to your videos</p>
<p><strong>6. Audience Retention</strong></p>
<h4 id="See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#See-How-Long-Your-Viewers-Spend-Watching-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos"></a><strong>See How Long Your Viewers Spend Watching Your Videos</strong></h4><p>Like Watch Time, Audience Retention is a metric YouTube uses to determine how valuable your video is and how worthy it is in being discovered by your audience. It’s important to learn where in your video you are losing viewers.</p>
<p>In Audience Retention, there are two main categories you can see.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Average View Duration</strong> shows how much time all your viewers from a certain time frame spend watching your video.</li>
<li><strong>Average Percentage Viewed</strong> shows how much the average person watched from your videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, we see that the average length of a video watched is 1:14 and the average viewer will watch 53% of the video.</p>
<p>While you should aim to have 100% audience retention, if you can get an average above 50%, you are doing something right. Anything under, you may want to consider changing up your strategy (content, structure, pacing, etc.).</p>

This will let you know which part of the video is most popular, which part is causing a big drop off, and which part viewers are skipping to or rewatching.</p>

<p><strong>Relative Audience Retention:</strong> This report gives you a visualization of how your video’s audience retention performance compares to all YouTube videos of a similar length.</p>
<p>If the line indicates that you are above average at a certain point, that is where your video is doing a better job holding the viewer’s attention at that point compared to most other videos.</p>

If you notice a steep drop in viewership, you can assume that what the viewer is watching is not that interesting.</p>
<p>However, if you notice a sudden peak in the middle of your video, you can assume that a) viewers are skipping to it or b) viewers are rewatching that section.</p>
<p>In the example below, we see that there is a peak at the point in this video where a specific part of a tutorial is shown. Viewers were most likely rewatching to confirm they understand the information, so they can apply it themselves.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>The way viewers watch content on their mobile phones is very different from the way they watch on television. By understanding how the majority of your viewers are watching your content, you can better design and structure your video.</p>
<p>For example, if you see that you have a large following that watches your content on mobile, then it might not be a good idea to load your video with too much text, as it’ll be hard for them to read.</p>
<p>You cannot control how people watch your content, but by better understanding their preferences, you can design your content to make it the best for their ideal situation.</p>
