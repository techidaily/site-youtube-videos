This will let you clip out the specific part of the song that you want to add to your video on YouTube. Once you have found the right segment of the track, you can preview it, and tap on the “Done” button to clip it.

That’s it! This will automatically add the selected music for YouTube Shorts, letting you post it on the app. If you want to make any changes, then you can tap on the track’s icon from the top. This will let you delete the added track for your video or change it with any other background music.
