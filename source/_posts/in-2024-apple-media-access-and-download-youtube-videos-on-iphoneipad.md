It is no secret that the iPhone and the iPad are the most popular smartphone and tablet respectively. You could argue that Samsung has impressive sales and is almost at par with Apple but in regards to sheer dominance or superiority, the South Korea based conglomerate bows down to the American tech juggernaut. YouTube is indisputably the most popular video hosting and sharing site in the world. It doesn’t help that YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine giant that also owns Android which powers all popular Samsung smartphones at the moment. As a result, what you get is a tad incompatible with YouTube and iPhone or iPad. Downloading YouTube videos is very simple if you are using an Android smartphone or a Windows computer. It is not so when you are using an iPhone, iPad or even a Mac.

Fortunately, there are ways you can download YouTube videos to iPhone or iPad, and we aren’t talking about YouTube’s promise of offline video streaming. Here is a complete guide.

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

### First, you need a video downloader

You need a third party app which is approved by Apple and available in App Store. There are quite a few free video downloader apps that you can check. But do make sure that the app is active or usable right now. Apple is a tad infamous for deleting some of the apps from its store from time to time. If that happens after you have installed and started using a video downloader, then you can just remove it and opt for another. Most of these free video downloader apps will save your videos within the app. Some would add them to the videos in your Camera Roll. You can use AirPlay to watch the videos if you have an Apple TV. The videos saved by downloader apps will not be found in the native Videos app of iPhone or iPad. When you search for such apps, use ‘video downloader’ or ‘YouTube downloader’ as the keywords.

### Find a suitable app, download it for free and install it

Some of the downloader apps will have premium or pro versions. You don’t need to pay before you have used the free or basic version. Once installed, start the app. Most of these apps have a built-in browser which should allow you to access YouTube. In most cases, you would get to m.youtube.com. If there is no default address, then save the mobile version of YouTube as the default URL. On iPad, you can go for <www.youtube.com>.

### Downloading Youtube videos to iPhone or iPad

In all likelihood, you are familiar with how YouTube works. Search for a video that you wish to download, pick the one you want from the search results and it would automatically start to play. In some cases, you may have to click the play button or tap on the video thumbnail for it to start playing. As the video begins to stream or buffer, you would find an icon of the app, usually bobbing or hovering over the screen playing the video. You can tap on this icon, which could be a disk sign or the logo of the app. As you tap on it, you would have a popup that will prompt you to download the video that you are watching.

![download youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-youtube-videos.jpg)

Depending on the app you are using, the download may begin immediately after tapping on the download icon or there can be another step, which will perhaps show you the list of downloading videos or videos that you have downloaded already. If the download doesn’t start immediately, there could be another button to initiate the download. Tap on it and you are done. The download would be automated and you don’t need to do anything else. You can also have your iPhone or iPad in sleep mode and the download would be completed, as long as there is an active internet connection. You can also see the progress made. Once the download or downloads are complete, you would get a notification. The video downloaded would be within the app’s video library or in your files.

Some apps rename the videos that are being downloaded so it is best you opt for a title or a name that will help you to recognize the video immediately. Other apps will keep the name of the video that appears on YouTube.

![download youtube videos on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-youtube-videos-on-iphone.jpg)

Almost all video downloader apps for iPhone and iPad will allow you to watch these videos offline. Some apps may need an internet connection to open but the videos saved will not require any internet to be played and replayed.

Given the fact that there are many video downloader apps and you cannot be sure of the experience of any, you will have to indulge in a bit of trial and error to find the best one.

Need Minecraft YouTube banners?

Gaming is the biggest genre on YouTube, and Minecraft resonates strongly with gamers of all ages. If you have a channel that features Minecraft content, and you want a banner that lets viewers know Minecraft is a focus of yours, then you’ve come to the right place!

There are a few sites where you can find Minecraft-themed channel art, and we’ve put together a list of the top 3.

> * [YouTube - Featured Channel: Netix](#netix)
> * [PlanetMinecraft Forums - Artists Section](#planetminecraft)
> * [Best Business Template](#bbt)

[**![free YouTube banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/50-free-youtube-banners-banner.jpg)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Netix on YouTube

[Netix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLW2fOeUEhu7kBvZwlOTZ4A/featured) posts Minecraft-themed graphics, and only Minecraft-themed graphics. You'll find a lot of high quality banners on this channel, and they're all free to download. Unlike a lot of creators who post one or two free banners, but mostly focus on other gaming content, Netix was at one point consistently posting new channel art (about once a month) for over a year.

Besides Netix, there are a lot of other artists posting gaming or Minecraft-themed banners on YouTube with download links. Just type 'minecraft youtube banner' into the search bar.

## PlanetMinecraft Forums – Artists Section

Planet Minecraft is a community for Minecraft fans, complete with forums. If you go into the forums, you’ll find an [Artists section](https://www.planetminecraft.com/forums/communities/artists) under Communities where people post all kinds of things they’ve created, including YouTube banners. [Here is an example of the kinds of posts you might find.](https://www.planetminecraft.com/forums/communities/artists/minecraft-youtube-banner-templat-441572/)

If you can’t find what you’re looking for here, you may at least be able to find someone to help you make it.

Think of a lot of the banners you find on these sites as templates. After downloading the image you’ll use as your background you can still personalize it by adding your channel’s name or logo, and even your posting schedule if you have one (keep [these dimensions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in mind so nothing gets cut off). This can be done easily, for free, in an online image editor like Canva.com or [some other sites](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).

Do you know anywhere else creators can get Minecraft YouTube banners?

Need Minecraft YouTube banners?

Gaming is the biggest genre on YouTube, and Minecraft resonates strongly with gamers of all ages. If you have a channel that features Minecraft content, and you want a banner that lets viewers know Minecraft is a focus of yours, then you’ve come to the right place!

There are a few sites where you can find Minecraft-themed channel art, and we’ve put together a list of the top 3.

> * [YouTube - Featured Channel: Netix](#netix)
> * [PlanetMinecraft Forums - Artists Section](#planetminecraft)
> * [Best Business Template](#bbt)

[**![free YouTube banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/50-free-youtube-banners-banner.jpg)**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Netix on YouTube

[Netix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLW2fOeUEhu7kBvZwlOTZ4A/featured) posts Minecraft-themed graphics, and only Minecraft-themed graphics. You'll find a lot of high quality banners on this channel, and they're all free to download. Unlike a lot of creators who post one or two free banners, but mostly focus on other gaming content, Netix was at one point consistently posting new channel art (about once a month) for over a year.

Besides Netix, there are a lot of other artists posting gaming or Minecraft-themed banners on YouTube with download links. Just type 'minecraft youtube banner' into the search bar.

## PlanetMinecraft Forums – Artists Section

Planet Minecraft is a community for Minecraft fans, complete with forums. If you go into the forums, you’ll find an [Artists section](https://www.planetminecraft.com/forums/communities/artists) under Communities where people post all kinds of things they’ve created, including YouTube banners. [Here is an example of the kinds of posts you might find.](https://www.planetminecraft.com/forums/communities/artists/minecraft-youtube-banner-templat-441572/)

If you can’t find what you’re looking for here, you may at least be able to find someone to help you make it.

## Best Business Template

[Best Business Template](https://www.soccerbbc.com/11525/minecraft-youtube-banner.html) has all kinds of graphics and images, including YouTube channel art. If you scroll through this page you’ll see a ton of Minecraft YouTube banners which you can download for free.

Think of a lot of the banners you find on these sites as templates. After downloading the image you’ll use as your background you can still personalize it by adding your channel’s name or logo, and even your posting schedule if you have one (keep [these dimensions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in mind so nothing gets cut off). This can be done easily, for free, in an online image editor like Canva.com or [some other sites](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)).
