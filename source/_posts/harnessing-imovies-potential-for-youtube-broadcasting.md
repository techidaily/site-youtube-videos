## Part 2: The Best iMovie Export Settings for YouTube Videos

As we all know that iMovie consists of a bit long procedure to export projects. Here are some tips on the best iMovie export settings to avoid an unnecessary headache.

1. **Set small resolution:** Small resolution plays a more significant role, especially while uploading. Thus, you can set the smallest resolution in **the Email** tab of the **Export** button.

2\. **Change Export settings in the File tab:** There is a **File** tab under the Export button. Click it and find various settings that you need to change to get the best export settings for YouTube 2021\. Make the **Title** of the video as small as possible. Set the resolution at 1080P than 4K.

However, it isn't going to upgrade the resolution if your video is already in the 1080P definition. Now, the last setting that will crazily offer you the best quality and lots of space-saving. You have to select **Best (ProRes)** in quality settings for this purpose. These settings also take less time to upload to YouTube.

3\. **Compress is not for speed:** Various options you see in **the Compress**tab are not for speed. They are for how you save the video on a desktop. Thus, always choose the **Better Quality** tab than **Faster**.

4. **Do not export directly to YouTube:** iMovie is pretty basic and doesn't offer great settings to upload your video instantly. You may have to make changes to the uploaded video even if you do this as per our step-by-step guide mentioned above.

## Part 2. Online YouTube MP3 Converters for Mac

There are several online applications that allow you to convert YouTube videos to MP3s. Two of the best are:

### Conversion Method 1: YouTube MP3 (online conversion site)

[YouTube MP3](https://ytmp3.cc/youtube-to-mp3/) is designed with simplicity in mind: you simply paste the YouTube URL into the field and click the “Convert Video” button and the YouTube MP3 website takes care of the rest. When the conversion is complete, you can download your MP3 file from their servers.

* **Pros**: No account needed, free-to-use, compatible with all devices and formats
* **Cons**: Requires fast and reliable online connection, takes 3-4 minutes per video

### Conversion Method 2: YouTube in MP3 (online conversion site)

[YouTube in MP3](https://yt1s.com/youtube-to-mp3/en3) is very similar to the above application, although it offers several appealing extra features. Paste in your URL and click, and the program does the work quickly – your download will be ready in seconds. This service works on computers, smartphones and tablets, in a variety of formats.

* **Pros**: No account or sign up necessary, free-to-use, offers low-, standard-, and high-quality output, edit MP3s online prior to download
* **Cons**: Requires a very good online connection, lacks more advanced editing and format features of a YouTube MP3 converter for Mac program
