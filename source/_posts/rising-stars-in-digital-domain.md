YouTube Creator Summit has been held for several years. In 2019, it was held in Tokyo, Japan, but back in 2016, 2017 and 2018, it was held in New York City. This article just introduced the YouTube Creator Summit in 2017.

Tons of big-name creators were flown out by YouTube for a week of activities, networking opportunities, interesting speakers, and unicorn petting zoos. We assume.

* [**S’well bottle**](#bottle)
* [**Branded slippers**](#slippers)
* [**Pins, pins, pins**](#pins)
* [**Denim jacket**](#jacket)

_Lilly’s Creator Summit adventures._

The Creator Summit is invite-only, and only 120 YouTubers attended including Grace Helbig, Lilly Singh, Matthew Santoro, Eva Gutowski, Jon Cozart, and Hannah Hart. We can really only imagine what went on based on what some YouTubers chose to share with us over social media. That’s how we know there were appearances from off-YouTube celebrities too, like Will Smith and Riz Ahmed.

_Will Smith was one of the speakers at the summit. Turns out_ [_he’s a big fan of Lilly Singh_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGlcsogbAQY)_._

Thanks to Nick from nickatnyte, for example, we have a pretty clear picture of the kinds of swag YouTube was giving away.

_Nick talks about arriving in New York and goes through the swag box waiting in his hotel room._

There were some clues as to what the rest of the summit was like hiding amongst the swag too. Here’s what was in the box:

## 1\. A map of Dumbo

The hotel YouTube put the creators up in was in Dumbo, Brooklyn. ‘Dumbo’ is an acronym for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. While it used to be primarily an industrial area, Dumbo is now the most expensive neighborhood in Brooklyn with many of the old industrial spaces now serving as luxury residential lofts. Dumbo is also a hub for tech startups.

_Tess takes you to some of her favorite places in Dumbo._

Dumbo is home to an interesting mix of ‘past’ and ‘future’. The creators who attended the summit probably had a lot of fun exploring it.

## 2\. Post Cards

One of the major benefits of attending this summit would have been networking with other creators, but because of how busy everyone was and how awkward it can be to arrange ‘bumping into’ someone YouTube created a way for creators to send each other notes. All they had to do was write a note on one of the postcards YouTube provided them with and stick it in one of the red mailboxes at the event. YouTube took care of making sure the person it was addressed to got it.

## 3\. S’well bottle

S’well bottles are stainless steel beverage containers that keep drinks hot or cold. They retail for around $45\. YouTubers invited to the Creator Summit received ones with YouTube branding on them. A good water bottle is a convention/conference essential, so this was a very practical gift.

## 4\. Branded slippers

To help them relax after long days at the summit, YouTube provided creators with YouTube-branded slippers. They look pretty comfy. Plus, now every time these YouTubers look down at their feet they’ll be reminded to go make some videos.

![Branded slippers - 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-branded-slippers.jpg)

_thinknoodles wearing his YouTube slippers._

## 5\. Pins, pins, pins

There were numerous custom pins available at different events at the summit. Aside from a complementary Brooklyn and 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge (the hotel the creators were staying at) pins, the creators did not receive these in their swag boxes – they had to collect them.

## 6\. Denim jacket

A denim jacket with a play button on it was also in the box. The idea was that creators would collect pins and display them on their new jackets. At the end of the week, they would have a great souvenir reminding them of every event they attended at the summit.

_![Denim jacket- 2017 YouTube Creator Summit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-summit-denim-jacket.jpg)_

_Hannah Hart posted this photo from a river cruise she and other YouTubers went on while in New York for the summit._

Most creators here on Filmora are still trying to grow their channels, but one day I hope you’ll be able to attend an event like the YouTube Creator Summit and tell us all about it!

The paid version is divided into 2 tiers: Canva Pro **($54.99 per year**) and Canva for team (**$84\. 90/year)**. One disadvantage of the Canva free version is that it is limited resolution options when exporting your file.

##### Flexclip

[Flexclip](https://www.flexclip.com/template/?search=news%20outro)is a free, powerful, and easy-to-use online video maker that helps you create beautiful and engaging content for your business.

You can add text, music, elements, overlays, and branding to your templates to make them more stunning and captivating.

The platform offers 3 paid plans starting at **$8.99/month.** The con here is that the free version is only limited to the export quality of 480p, single royalty-free stock use, and 12 projects limit.

##### Placeit

[Placeit](https://placeit.net/?search=news+outros) is an online editor giving you the ability to create and customize your video content in no time. The editor also includes a stock image library, giving you access to several customizable templates.

![placeit video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/placeit-video-editor.jpg)

Placeit is easy to use and offers a variety of templates for different purposes, including outros for news stories, video blogs, and even gaming videos. The platform offers an unlimited subscription plan starting from **$7.47 /month.**

However, the design rendering process of the editor is slow, there is no AI tool, and you even cannot import fonts that are not available on the platform.

### Non-Editable News Outro Template Websites

Some platforms offer non-editable high-resolution news outros that you can integrate into your videos using software programs like [Filmora (guidance in Part 3),](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FEdit) After Effects, etc.

##### Storyblock

Searching for high-quality templates for your next project?[Storyblock](https://www.storyblocks.com/video/search/news+outros) is a website that comes with royalty-free, non-customizable news style outros.

![storyblock news outros templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/storyblock-news-outros-templates.jpg)

You can use these templates to create high-quality news intros and outros for your podcast or videos. The platform offers two pricing plans for individual content creators, starting at **$15** per month. While businesses can customize their plans as per their requirements.

Limitations of the Storyblock are that the footage quality is very poor in the free version, and the paid versions might be tricky to avail sometimes.

##### Videvo
