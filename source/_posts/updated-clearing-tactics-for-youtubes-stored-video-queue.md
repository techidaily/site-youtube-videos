### How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?

You can delete the YouTube Watch Later Playlist on your desktop in the following ways:

##### From YouTube Homepage

To clear the YouTube Watch Later Playlist from the YouTube Homepage, do the following steps:

Step1 First, open a browser on your PC and visit the [**YouTube homepage**](https://www.youtube.com/index?feature=signin)**.** Sign into your account if needed and click the **"Library"** option located at the left-hand side menu panel.

![accessing the youtube web library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-youtube-web-library.png)

Step2 Croll down and click the **"See All"** option under the Watch Later header. Click the **Three Dots** below the Watch Later playlist details on the next page.

Step3 From the drop-down menu, click **"Remove Watch Videos."** This will instantly remove all the videos you've watched but are still in the playlist.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step4 Finally, to remove the unwatched videos, hover over a video and click the **Three Dots**. Select the **"Remove from Watch Later"** option to delete the video. You can repeat this process to remove all the content from the playlist until it is decluttered at the point of your satisfaction.

##### Using A Script

Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:

Step1 In the first step, launch the [**Google Chrome**](https://www.google.com/intl/en%5Fpk/chrome/) browser on your system and head to the **YouTube** website**.** Next, select the **"Library"** option in the left pane and click **"Watch Later"** from the menu.

Step2 Now, hit the **"Ctrl + Shift + J"** keys on Windows or the **"Command + Option+ J"** buttons on Mac to launch the developer mode and open the console window.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.

setInterval(function () { document.querySelector('#primary button\[aria-label="Action menu"\]').click(); var things = document.evaluate( '//span\[contains(text(),"Remove from")\]', document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED\_NODE\_SNAPSHOT\_TYPE, null ); for (var i = 0; i < things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);

Step4 In the last step, hit the **"Enter"** key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.

Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.

You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.

There are a lot of reasons why you might want to use footage recorded from the screen of your apple device in your YouTube videos. Some people like to make YouTube tutorials about iPhone or iPad apps, others like to share their gaming experiences, and some need to use footage taken from their devices for presentations. Even if you do not think these kinds of videos suit your vlog, screen recording is a useful tool to have on your belt. You never know when one of your subscribers is going to ask you about your favorite mobile games.

Basically, there are three ways to record YouTube video on iPhone/iPad, including the built-in screen recorder (if you have [updated to iOS 11](https://support.apple.com/ios/update)), connecting iPhone to Mac and the last, some third party screen recorder. In this article, you will learn the three powerful methods one by one.

* [**Part1: Recording your iPhone screen in iOS 11**](#part1)
* [**Part2: Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac**](#part2)
* [**Part3: Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector**](#part3)

**Note:** We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads. This tutorial is only for downloading YouTube videos/audio materials from your own channel.

## 1\. Recording your iPhone screen in [iOS 11](https://www.apple.com/lae/ios/ios-11/)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac

If you have a Mac then you already have all the software you need.

**Step 1**: Connect your tablet or smartphone to your computer using a USB port, and then open QuickTime on your Mac. In QuickTime select â€˜Fileâ€™ and â€˜New Movie Recordingâ€™. A recording window will pop up.

**Step 2**: In the recording window there will be a red â€˜recordâ€™ button. Next to that button there will be an arrow. Click the arrow and a menu of recording options will appear. In the section where it says â€˜Cameraâ€™ select your iPhone or iPad. In this menu you can also choose whether or not to record audio from your device, such sound effects from games.

**Step 3**: Once you are finished in this menu click record to begin recording the screen of your device. Click â€˜stopâ€™ when you are finished recording.

Although you can download a version of QuickTime for PC, the PC version does not have a screen recording option. If you have a PC you will need to use the second method.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)

If you either prefer to do things wirelessly or own a PC then you will need to use a slightly more round-about method. Rather than recording directly from your iPhone you will be mirroring your deviceâ€™s interface onto your computer screen and then recording it there.

**Step 1**: First, you will need to download a third party mirroring app. Reflector is the popular choice. You can download Reflector at [Airsquirrels.com](http://www.airsquirrels.com/).Next, you need to have Appleâ€™s Airplay on your device. Make sure Reflector that your computer and device are connected to the same wifi network.

**Step 2**: Open Reflector on your PC. Initially it will tell you there is no device connected.

**Step 3**: Open AirPlay on your device and make sure mirroring is turned on. Your computerâ€™s name will show up as a receiver option. Select it.

**Step 4**: This will cause the display of your smartphone or tablet to pop up on your computer screen. Once your device is being mirrored on your computer, record your computer screen.

You can record your Mac or PC screen using Filmora Video Editor. Using Filmora you can crop out and record only your iPhone display instead of your entire computer screen. You can download the latest version of Filmora Video Editor at Filmora.wondershare.com.

If you have a Mac you can also record your computer screen in QuickTime following the same steps listed above, until it comes time to choose your camera. Then you record your desktop instead of your device. There are a few different screen recording programs you can download for PC.

## Conclusion

After reading the three ways to record YouTube on iPhone/iPad, I am sure you want to give it a try. If you have any questions, please let us know!

## 1\. Recording your iPhone screen in [iOS 11](https://www.apple.com/lae/ios/ios-11/)

You can find more information in this article: [How to Record iPhone/iPadâ€™s Screen in iOS 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \>>

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## 2\. Wired Using QuickTime on your Mac

If you have a Mac then you already have all the software you need.

**Step 1**: Connect your tablet or smartphone to your computer using a USB port, and then open QuickTime on your Mac. In QuickTime select â€˜Fileâ€™ and â€˜New Movie Recordingâ€™. A recording window will pop up.

**Step 2**: In the recording window there will be a red â€˜recordâ€™ button. Next to that button there will be an arrow. Click the arrow and a menu of recording options will appear. In the section where it says â€˜Cameraâ€™ select your iPhone or iPad. In this menu you can also choose whether or not to record audio from your device, such sound effects from games.

**Step 3**: Once you are finished in this menu click record to begin recording the screen of your device. Click â€˜stopâ€™ when you are finished recording.

Although you can download a version of QuickTime for PC, the PC version does not have a screen recording option. If you have a PC you will need to use the second method.

## 3\. Wirelessly Using AirPlay and Reflector(For Mac or PC!)

If you either prefer to do things wirelessly or own a PC then you will need to use a slightly more round-about method. Rather than recording directly from your iPhone you will be mirroring your deviceâ€™s interface onto your computer screen and then recording it there.

**Step 1**: First, you will need to download a third party mirroring app. Reflector is the popular choice. You can download Reflector at [Airsquirrels.com](http://www.airsquirrels.com/).Next, you need to have Appleâ€™s Airplay on your device. Make sure Reflector that your computer and device are connected to the same wifi network.

**Step 2**: Open Reflector on your PC. Initially it will tell you there is no device connected.

**Step 3**: Open AirPlay on your device and make sure mirroring is turned on. Your computerâ€™s name will show up as a receiver option. Select it.

**Step 4**: This will cause the display of your smartphone or tablet to pop up on your computer screen. Once your device is being mirrored on your computer, record your computer screen.

You can record your Mac or PC screen using Filmora Video Editor. Using Filmora you can crop out and record only your iPhone display instead of your entire computer screen. You can download the latest version of Filmora Video Editor at Filmora.wondershare.com.

If you have a Mac you can also record your computer screen in QuickTime following the same steps listed above, until it comes time to choose your camera. Then you record your desktop instead of your device. There are a few different screen recording programs you can download for PC.

## Conclusion

After reading the three ways to record YouTube on iPhone/iPad, I am sure you want to give it a try. If you have any questions, please let us know!

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

There are a lot of reasons why you might want to use footage recorded from the screen of your apple device in your YouTube videos. Some people like to make YouTube tutorials about iPhone or iPad apps, others like to share their gaming experiences, and some need to use footage taken from their devices for presentations. Even if you do not think these kinds of videos suit your vlog, screen recording is a useful tool to have on your belt. You never know when one of your subscribers is going to ask you about your favorite mobile games.

Basically, there are three ways to record YouTube video on iPhone/iPad, including the built-in screen recorder (if you have [updated to iOS 11](https://support.apple.com/ios/update)), connecting iPhone to Mac and the last, some third party screen recorder. In this article, you will learn the three powerful methods one by one.
