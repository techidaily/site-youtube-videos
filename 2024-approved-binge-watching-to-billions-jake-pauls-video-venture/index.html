<p>There is a lot to learn about YouTube success from Jake Paul. With more than 300 hours of video uploaded onto YouTube every minute by more than ten million content creators, standing out from the competition and becoming a YouTube star can seem impossible. But, Jake Paul managed to achieve that in a short amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul"><a href="#How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="How Old Is Jake Paul?"></a>How Old Is Jake Paul?</h3><p>Twenty-three-year-old Jake Joseph Paul was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the U.S. on January 17, 1997, to realtor father Greg Paul and nurse mother, Pam Stepnick.</p>
<h3 id="Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul"><a href="#Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul" class="headerlink" title="Logan Paul and Jake Paul"></a>Logan Paul and Jake Paul</h3><p>He and his older brother, Logan, grew up in Westlake, Ohio, and played a lot of football together growing up. Jake’s childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.</p>
<p>Jake’s favorite YouTube channel at the time was “Smosh,” featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, “Zoosh” (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.</p>
<p>For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school’s varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.</p>
<p>But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).</p>

<p>Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.</p>
<p>Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.</p>
<h3 id="Jake-Paul-and-Disney"><a href="#Jake-Paul-and-Disney" class="headerlink" title="Jake Paul and Disney"></a>Jake Paul and Disney</h3><p>Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Jake auditioned for Disney Channel’s comedy series “Bizaardvark” and successfully landed the role of “Dirk.” However, the Disney Channel grew more and more uncomfortable with Jake’s growing image as an outrageous teenager. After Jake made it onto the KTLA 5 news for the noise complaints around his mansion, the Disney Channel fired him from Bizaardvark.</p>

<h3 id="Team-10"><a href="#Team-10" class="headerlink" title="Team 10"></a>Team 10</h3><p>In 2016, with all of his many exciting experiences, Jake put together a humorous and motivational memoir titled “You Gotta Want It.” As his own social media channels kept on growing rapidly, Jake launched “<strong>Team 10</strong>,” his own influencer management agency comprised of other teen social media influencers. In order to collaborate with one another more easily, they all moved in together to a Beverly Grove mansion that rents for $17,000 USD a month. After Jake publicized his address, the mansion attracted so many fans that neighbors filed multiple noise complaints and even contemplated filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Jake.</p>
<p>More than a home, the mansion became a film set. The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.</p>

<p>On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled “It’s <strong>Everyday Bro</strong>.” While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video’s success.</p>
<p>As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to “It’s Everyday Bro,” mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own “diss track” music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.</p>
<p>Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.</p>

<p>When a new social media service pops up, there’s so much opportunity to quickly rack up a huge number of followers simply by being one of the early content creators on that platform. This was the case for the Paul brothers on Vine. After the fall of Vine, the Paul brothers were able to migrate their Vine fans over to YouTube.</p>

<p>Jake has a very good understanding of who his audience is. He knows that his audience is young. By knowing the age group that the majority of his audience falls under, Jake is then able to tailor his content in a way that captures his audience’s attention most effectively. Through high-energy prank videos and daring stunts, Jake is able to supply his audience with the content that they want. As a YouTuber, you can get an idea of who your main audience is by accessing your channel’s analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment To Consistent Delivery of Audience-Centered Content</strong></p>
<p>Jake made a serious commitment to delivering audience-centered content. Jake moved into a house full of other teenagers also committed to content creation, and they all filmed themselves doing pranks and stunts every day.</p>

<p>On May 30, 2017, Jake uploaded a rap music video with Team 10 titled “It’s <strong>Everyday Bro</strong>.” While Jake is no stranger to making popular videos, the number of views this music video garnered was on another level. The stark difference between the high production quality of the video and the unimpressive lyrical content may have been the perfect combination that catapulted the video’s success.</p>
<p>As it always happens with all videos that go viral, many YouTubers jumped on the bandwagon and made their own reaction videos to “It’s Everyday Bro,” mostly making fun of Jake. Some big-name YouTubers, including his own brother, even went as far as producing their own “diss track” music video. This drama created even more heavy traffic around Jake, which he cleverly responded with more video content.</p>
<p>Despite all of these oppositions in his life, Jake continues to work hard to build his social media empire. Looking at all the many strategies he has already successfully executed from such a young age, and I have no doubts that Jake will continue to push the boundaries of social media and content creation in the years to come.</p>

<p>When a new social media service pops up, there’s so much opportunity to quickly rack up a huge number of followers simply by being one of the early content creators on that platform. This was the case for the Paul brothers on Vine. After the fall of Vine, the Paul brothers were able to migrate their Vine fans over to YouTube.</p>

<p>Jake has a very good understanding of who his audience is. He knows that his audience is young. By knowing the age group that the majority of his audience falls under, Jake is then able to tailor his content in a way that captures his audience’s attention most effectively. Through high-energy prank videos and daring stunts, Jake is able to supply his audience with the content that they want. As a YouTuber, you can get an idea of who your main audience is by accessing your channel’s analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment To Consistent Delivery of Audience-Centered Content</strong></p>
<p>Jake made a serious commitment to delivering audience-centered content. Jake moved into a house full of other teenagers also committed to content creation, and they all filmed themselves doing pranks and stunts every day.</p>

<p>There is a lot to learn about YouTube success from Jake Paul. With more than 300 hours of video uploaded onto YouTube every minute by more than ten million content creators, standing out from the competition and becoming a YouTube star can seem impossible. But, Jake Paul managed to achieve that in a short amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul-2"><a href="#How-Old-Is-Jake-Paul-2" class="headerlink" title="How Old Is Jake Paul?"></a>How Old Is Jake Paul?</h3><p>Twenty-three-year-old Jake Joseph Paul was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the U.S. on January 17, 1997, to realtor father Greg Paul and nurse mother, Pam Stepnick.</p>
<h3 id="Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul-2"><a href="#Logan-Paul-and-Jake-Paul-2" class="headerlink" title="Logan Paul and Jake Paul"></a>Logan Paul and Jake Paul</h3><p>He and his older brother, Logan, grew up in Westlake, Ohio, and played a lot of football together growing up. Jake’s childhood dream was to play for the NFL. Thinking they might enjoy filming themselves playing football, their father got them a camera. With this camera, Jake and his brother began filming themselves doing skits, pranks, and scripted videos.</p>
<p>Jake’s favorite YouTube channel at the time was “Smosh,” featuring the comedic duo Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla. Smosh was such an inspiration to them that the two Paul brothers started their own channel, “Zoosh” (notice the similar-sounding channel name?) - their old Zoosh channel and videos are still publicly available on YouTube.</p>
<p>For the majority of his years in school, Jake was the class clown. As he got older, though, he focused on football and wrestling and made it into his school’s varsity wrestling team. Around this time, Jake also began to contemplate what he would do after high school. Figuring he wanted to join the U.S. Navy SEALs, Jake started training for recruitment.</p>
<p>But before Jake fully invested his energy into training for the U.S. Navy SEALS, his brother, Logan, convinced him to make videos with him again (by this time, Logan had already built up a large following on Vine, the short-form video hosting service).</p>

<p>Together with his older brother Logan, Jake also amassed a large following and eventually began receiving paid sponsorships, at which point Jake realized that he could make a career out of video content creation.</p>
<p>Curious, young, and adventurous, at the age of seventeen, after discussing with his mother, Jake dropped out of high school, put aside his pursuit to join the Navy SEALs, and moved to Los Angeles without much of a plan.</p>
<h3 id="Jake-Paul-and-Disney-2"><a href="#Jake-Paul-and-Disney-2" class="headerlink" title="Jake Paul and Disney"></a>Jake Paul and Disney</h3><p>Not wasting a single day in L.A., Jake went straight to taking acting and improv classes, growing his social media, and networking with everyone he could meet in the entertainment industry. In 2015, Jake auditioned for Disney Channel’s comedy series “Bizaardvark” and successfully landed the role of “Dirk.” However, the Disney Channel grew more and more uncomfortable with Jake’s growing image as an outrageous teenager. After Jake made it onto the KTLA 5 news for the noise complaints around his mansion, the Disney Channel fired him from Bizaardvark.</p>

In order to collaborate with one another more easily, they all moved in together to a Beverly Grove mansion that rents for $17,000 USD a month. After Jake publicized his address, the mansion attracted so many fans that neighbors filed multiple noise complaints and even contemplated filing a class-action public nuisance lawsuit against Jake.</p>
<p>More than a home, the mansion became a film set. The teenage tenants filmed themselves pranking one another and being as outrageous as teenagers can possibly be.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-YouTube-Premium"><a href="#What-is-YouTube-Premium" class="headerlink" title="What is YouTube Premium?"></a>What is YouTube Premium?</h2><p>This streaming service was initially launched in 2014 and was later rebranded in 2018 as YouTube Premium. It includes YouTube music and other features that Google added to it. You can download content, perform background playback and even get access to YouTube original content. Note that this came at a cost as its price was raised. But what remains is that you get value for your money.</p>
<h4 id="1-What-service-is-included-in-the-Premium-subscription"><a href="#1-What-service-is-included-in-the-Premium-subscription" class="headerlink" title="1. What service is included in the Premium subscription?"></a>1.

<p>Background play: It allows one to play your videos in the background, enabling you to use the app as a music player.</p>
<p>Offline playback: Easily view your videos on your phone or tablet. It means you can download a video or music and play them while not on the internet.</p>
<p>Ad-free videos: Say goodbye to popular ads with YouTube Free subscription. You already catered for your freedom in the subscription.</p>
<p>YouTube Music Premium: YouTube music is available for free even though you won’t download it for offline playback on this tier.</p>
<p>Flip between apps swiftly: Your videos will continue playing even if you switch to another app. You can flip apps on your device, like check emails, read Twitter, scroll to texts and still play your videos.</p>
<h4 id="2-The-price-of-a-YouTube-Premium-subscription"><a href="#2-The-price-of-a-YouTube-Premium-subscription" class="headerlink" title="2. The price of a YouTube Premium subscription"></a>2. The price of a YouTube Premium subscription</h4><p>YouTube Premium isn’t different from other services. Like most streaming services, you get family and student plans. YouTube Premium costs your $6.99 monthly subscription for students’ plans. You, however, need to verify that you are a student. A family plan comes at $17.99 per month, where you can add up to five members. Single YouTube Premium will cost you $11.99 a month</p>
<h4 id="3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan"><a href="#3-Does-YouTube-Premium-provide-an-annual-plan" class="headerlink" title="3. Does YouTube Premium provide an annual plan?"></a>3.

<h4 id="4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium"><a href="#4-What-is-the-difference-between-YouTube-TV-and-YouTube-Premium" class="headerlink" title="4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium"></a>4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium</h4><p>Even though they sound similar, YouTube TV and YouTube Premium are different in many aspects. While YouTube Premium is a paid subscription, YouTube TV is a live streaming service. Let’s explore more differences.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-included"><a href="#What-is-included" class="headerlink" title="What is included"></a>What is included</h5><p>If you subscribe to YouTube Premium, then you unlock other streaming features. These include watching YouTube without ads on its apps, managing offline viewing, playing your videos in the background, and getting YouTube Music, among others.</p>
<p>You can watch various channels over the internet with YouTube TV, live. It offers you close to 90 channels cutting across lifestyle, news, entertainment, sports, etc. Likewise, you can stream live broadcasts from top networks like NBC, FOX, ABC, etc. It will also splash your screen with news channels from BBC America, CNN, FOX News, etc.</p>
<h5 id="Cost"><a href="#Cost" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h5><p>When it comes to pricing, YouTube Premium costs $11.00 per month with a free, one-month trial for new subscribers. It also has different plans for students and families. On the other hand, YouTube TV starts at $64.99 per month. However, first-time subscribers can get a free offer of up to one week at no cost. This rate may seem high, but it is competitive with other live TV streaming services.</p>
<h5 id="Accessibility"><a href="#Accessibility" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h5><p>YouTube TV is readily available on the web, mobile platforms, and media streaming devices like Fire TV and Chromecast. You can also download the YouTube TV app to enjoy it on players like game consoles and PlayStations. For YouTube Premium, you’ll easily access it by subscription.</p>
<p>However, there are areas where both YouTube TV and YouTube Premium overlap. Both will let you watch YouTube Originals.</p>
<p>You will also enjoy your videos without adverts interruption. Additionally, it would be best to have an internet connection to stream your videos before downloading. And after downloading and saving your files, you can stream them offline on YouTube Premium.</p>
<p>So, which is better?</p>
<p>YouTube Premium subscribers think it’s the better choice. For one, if you like entertainment from services like Hulu, Netflix, Disney, and much more, then YouTube Premium has you covered than YouTube TV.</p>
<h5 id="Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries"><a href="#Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?"></a>Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?</h5><p>● YouTube Premium is not available in some countries. The likely reason is that those countries’ laws prevent it from being offered.</p>
<p>● But worry less, you can still access YouTube Premium even if it’s not available in your country. You can switch to an alternative county and stream videos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a quick switch by first clicking the “Country” button on the bottom of the YouTube homepage. Here, you’ll view various available countries where YouTube Premium is accessible.</li>
<li>Then click any country of choice to switch to. It will give you that country’s YouTube version.</li>
<li>You can also change your language if it presents a foreign language video and description. Just click on the “Language” button on the page.</li>
<li>Finally, access and play any YouTube premium video virtually from the country you switched to.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to"><a href="#Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to" class="headerlink" title="Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?"></a>Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?</h2><p>Even with the lack of YouTube Premium annual subscription, it still beats all odds to subscribe to this streaming service.</p>
<h4 id="1-Offline-playback"><a href="#1-Offline-playback" class="headerlink" title="1) Offline playback"></a>1) Offline playback</h4><p>Office playback is one reason why YouTube lovers opt for the Premium subscription. Saving your videos for offline listening gives you more advantages than needing to be online to stream your videos. You can do it by simply checking for the “Download” icon below the video you wish to save on your device for later watching. You are then free to stream your files at any time, on the go!</p>
<h4 id="2-Free-of-ads-at-last"><a href="#2-Free-of-ads-at-last" class="headerlink" title="2) Free of ads at last"></a>2) Free of ads at last</h4><p>YouTube streaming is much better without ever interacting with adverts. There are no pop-ups with the Premium version, letting you enjoy every bit of your video streaming. Again, such interruptions aren’t healthy for a tutorial session. Without ads, you can fully concentrate on video playing, letting you get quality value for your time.</p>
<h4 id="3-Get-original-content"><a href="#3-Get-original-content" class="headerlink" title="3) Get original content"></a>3) Get original content</h4><p>By fact, it is clear that this platform lets you interact with high-end artists who dwell on giving original content to their viewers. You’ll get a perfect chance to subscribe to artists who offer content, i.e., exclusive to the paid tier.</p>
<h4 id="4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free"><a href="#4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free" class="headerlink" title="4) Included Google Play Music for free"></a>4) Included Google Play Music for free</h4><p>It’s a double party for YouTube Premium subscribers. You have the advantage of getting Google Play Music when you subscribe to YouTube Music Premium. More so, the Google Play library gives you tones of music from their library. Combined with YouTube Premium offers, you won’t have any reason not to feel entertained from any genre of choice.</p>
<h4 id="Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way"><a href="#Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way" class="headerlink" title="Some improvements will go a long way"></a>Some improvements will go a long way</h4><p>Despite all the reasons to subscribe to YouTube Premium, it still needs a minor improvement to perfection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The YouTube Premium service’s availability is limited compared to the initial YouTube version. Therefore, some countries prohibit its usage and are only accessible in about 70 countries. Hopefully, it will be available worldwide so that no user is limited.</li>
<li>YouTube Premium subscription does not give any discounts on any of the subscriptions. And being that it has no yearly subscriptions, the amount remains the same whether you opt for one month or pay it times 12 for the year. There should be some considerations for offers, primarily when you cover the one-year payments.</li>
<li>Some users feel the price is higher than other streaming services. However, YouTube claims to offer free Google Play music. Perhaps this is the reason for the slight rise.</li>
<li>This streaming service lacks some extras like rentals and charged station subscriptions. Other features like “lyrics” to the songs have also not been catered for. Likewise, some extra information like the title or genre of the video you watch is not included. These small extras could go a long way if they were to be added.</li>
<li>YouTube Premium also seems to pay attention to celebrities other than YouTubers. Most originals are not exclusive to Premium subscribers, while you can watch them with ads on a free account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Amidst the many YouTube subscriptions, YouTube Premium has come a long way. Additionally, it hasn’t covered all the countries just yet. However, it has eliminated the presence of annoying ads that are prominent with the free YouTube service. More so, you get free access to Google Play Music, among other added values. Despite those, the app still needs some improvements in its services to incorporate YouTube Premium subscribers in its walk fully.</p>

What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium"></a>4. What is the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium</h4><p>Even though they sound similar, YouTube TV and YouTube Premium are different in many aspects. While YouTube Premium is a paid subscription, YouTube TV is a live streaming service. Let’s explore more differences.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-included-2"><a href="#What-is-included-2" class="headerlink" title="What is included"></a>What is included</h5><p>If you subscribe to YouTube Premium, then you unlock other streaming features. These include watching YouTube without ads on its apps, managing offline viewing, playing your videos in the background, and getting YouTube Music, among others.</p>
<p>You can watch various channels over the internet with YouTube TV, live. It offers you close to 90 channels cutting across lifestyle, news, entertainment, sports, etc. Likewise, you can stream live broadcasts from top networks like NBC, FOX, ABC, etc. It will also splash your screen with news channels from BBC America, CNN, FOX News, etc.</p>
<h5 id="Cost-2"><a href="#Cost-2" class="headerlink" title="Cost"></a>Cost</h5><p>When it comes to pricing, YouTube Premium costs $11.00 per month with a free, one-month trial for new subscribers. It also has different plans for students and families. On the other hand, YouTube TV starts at $64.99 per month. However, first-time subscribers can get a free offer of up to one week at no cost. This rate may seem high, but it is competitive with other live TV streaming services.</p>
<h5 id="Accessibility-2"><a href="#Accessibility-2" class="headerlink" title="Accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h5><p>YouTube TV is readily available on the web, mobile platforms, and media streaming devices like Fire TV and Chromecast. You can also download the YouTube TV app to enjoy it on players like game consoles and PlayStations. For YouTube Premium, you’ll easily access it by subscription.</p>
<p>However, there are areas where both YouTube TV and YouTube Premium overlap. Both will let you watch YouTube Originals.</p>
<p>You will also enjoy your videos without adverts interruption. Additionally, it would be best to have an internet connection to stream your videos before downloading. And after downloading and saving your files, you can stream them offline on YouTube Premium.</p>
<p>So, which is better?</p>
<p>YouTube Premium subscribers think it’s the better choice. For one, if you like entertainment from services like Hulu, Netflix, Disney, and much more, then YouTube Premium has you covered than YouTube TV.</p>
<h5 id="Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries-2"><a href="#Q-A-Is-YouTube-Premium-subscription-available-in-all-countries-2" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?"></a>Q&amp;A: Is YouTube Premium subscription available in all countries?</h5><p>● YouTube Premium is not available in some countries. The likely reason is that those countries’ laws prevent it from being offered.</p>
<p>● But worry less, you can still access YouTube Premium even if it’s not available in your country. You can switch to an alternative county and stream videos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a quick switch by first clicking the “Country” button on the bottom of the YouTube homepage. Here, you’ll view various available countries where YouTube Premium is accessible.</li>
<li>Then click any country of choice to switch to. It will give you that country’s YouTube version.</li>
<li>You can also change your language if it presents a foreign language video and description. Just click on the “Language” button on the page.</li>
<li>Finally, access and play any YouTube premium video virtually from the country you switched to.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to-2"><a href="#Is-YouTube-Premium-worth-subscribing-to-2" class="headerlink" title="Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?"></a>Is YouTube Premium worth subscribing to?</h2><p>Even with the lack of YouTube Premium annual subscription, it still beats all odds to subscribe to this streaming service.</p>
<h4 id="1-Offline-playback-2"><a href="#1-Offline-playback-2" class="headerlink" title="1) Offline playback"></a>1) Offline playback</h4><p>Office playback is one reason why YouTube lovers opt for the Premium subscription. Saving your videos for offline listening gives you more advantages than needing to be online to stream your videos. You can do it by simply checking for the “Download” icon below the video you wish to save on your device for later watching. You are then free to stream your files at any time, on the go!</p>
<h4 id="2-Free-of-ads-at-last-2"><a href="#2-Free-of-ads-at-last-2" class="headerlink" title="2) Free of ads at last"></a>2) Free of ads at last</h4><p>YouTube streaming is much better without ever interacting with adverts. There are no pop-ups with the Premium version, letting you enjoy every bit of your video streaming. Again, such interruptions aren’t healthy for a tutorial session. Without ads, you can fully concentrate on video playing, letting you get quality value for your time.</p>
<h4 id="3-Get-original-content-2"><a href="#3-Get-original-content-2" class="headerlink" title="3) Get original content"></a>3) Get original content</h4><p>By fact, it is clear that this platform lets you interact with high-end artists who dwell on giving original content to their viewers. You’ll get a perfect chance to subscribe to artists who offer content, i.e., exclusive to the paid tier.</p>
<h4 id="4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free-2"><a href="#4-Included-Google-Play-Music-for-free-2" class="headerlink" title="4) Included Google Play Music for free"></a>4) Included Google Play Music for free</h4><p>It’s a double party for YouTube Premium subscribers. You have the advantage of getting Google Play Music when you subscribe to YouTube Music Premium. More so, the Google Play library gives you tones of music from their library. Combined with YouTube Premium offers, you won’t have any reason not to feel entertained from any genre of choice.</p>
<h4 id="Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way-2"><a href="#Some-improvements-will-go-a-long-way-2" class="headerlink" title="Some improvements will go a long way"></a>Some improvements will go a long way</h4><p>Despite all the reasons to subscribe to YouTube Premium, it still needs a minor improvement to perfection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The YouTube Premium service’s availability is limited compared to the initial YouTube version. Therefore, some countries prohibit its usage and are only accessible in about 70 countries. Hopefully, it will be available worldwide so that no user is limited.</li>
<li>YouTube Premium subscription does not give any discounts on any of the subscriptions. And being that it has no yearly subscriptions, the amount remains the same whether you opt for one month or pay it times 12 for the year. There should be some considerations for offers, primarily when you cover the one-year payments.</li>
<li>Some users feel the price is higher than other streaming services. However, YouTube claims to offer free Google Play music. Perhaps this is the reason for the slight rise.</li>
<li>This streaming service lacks some extras like rentals and charged station subscriptions. Other features like “lyrics” to the songs have also not been catered for. Likewise, some extra information like the title or genre of the video you watch is not included. These small extras could go a long way if they were to be added.</li>
<li>YouTube Premium also seems to pay attention to celebrities other than YouTubers. Most originals are not exclusive to Premium subscribers, while you can watch them with ads on a free account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Amidst the many YouTube subscriptions, YouTube Premium has come a long way. Additionally, it hasn’t covered all the countries just yet. However, it has eliminated the presence of annoying ads that are prominent with the free YouTube service. More so, you get free access to Google Play Music, among other added values. Despite those, the app still needs some improvements in its services to incorporate YouTube Premium subscribers in its walk fully.</p>
