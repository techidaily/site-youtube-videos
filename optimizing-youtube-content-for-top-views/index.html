<p> If there exists searches, there exists SEO. YouTube now is the second largest search engine which processes more than 3 billion searches in a single month. Besides making sure that each video you upload to YouTube offers thought-provoking content, you can also optimize the video in accordance with the rules of SEO to stand out from the 500 hours of videos uploaded per minutes.</p>
<p> If you are trying to learn more about the SEO optimization of YouTube videos, you’ve landed on the right page, because in this guide we are going to take you through the process of improving the search rankings for each video you upload to YouTube.</p>
<h2 id="YouTube-SEO-Guide"><a href="#YouTube-SEO-Guide" class="headerlink" title="YouTube SEO Guide"></a>YouTube SEO Guide</h2><p><strong>Quick Jump Menu:</strong></p>

<h3 id="The-Basics-Five-Main-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#The-Basics-Five-Main-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="The Basics - Five Main Traffic Sources"></a>The Basics - Five Main Traffic Sources</h3><p> Producing a video and posting it on your YouTube channel is simply not enough to guarantee its success. You have to know where the video’s traffic will come from, because over 500 hours of video content are being uploaded each minute, and there are over 50 million content creators on the platform.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p> That’s the reason why you have to develop a strategy that will attract the traffic to your videos and place them high in the YouTube’s search rankings. Let’s have a look at five traffic sources that will boost the number of views and comments videos are getting.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Search"><a href="#YouTube-Search" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Search"></a>YouTube Search</h4><p> A great deal of traffic for your videos can come from the search results, which makes the title of a video one of the most important aspects of SEO optimization on YouTube.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-search-traffic.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p> Don’t use long titles, strive to use short and catchy titles that also contain keywords which accurately describe the contents of the video in order to appear higher in the YouTube’s search results.</p>
<h4 id="Suggested-Videos"><a href="#Suggested-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Videos"></a>Suggested Videos</h4><p> The platform offers video suggestions that cover topics similar to those of the videos you already watched. Once more, the title and the description you provided will play a crucial role in driving more traffic to your videos, so make sure that each video you post on YouTube has an effective title that will spark interest in a potential viewer to take action and actually watch the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Suggested videos that appear from links in a video description.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Advertising"><a href="#YouTube-Advertising" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Advertising"></a>YouTube Advertising</h4><p> Investing in the promotion of the content you’re posting on your channel can help you to generate more views, but different types of YouTube ads produce different results. Non-skippable ads never count as a view, while a skippable ad that lasts more than ten seconds must be viewed for at least thirty seconds in order to qualify as a view. All other types of YouTube ads require the viewer to click on them and play them so the YouTube Analytics can recognize the action as a view.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists"><a href="#Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists" class="headerlink" title="Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists"></a>Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists</h4><p><strong>Channel Pages -</strong> This method of generating traffic includes views created by other channel owners as well as Topic Channels that are automatically created using the platform’s video discovery system. In either case, your videos are discovered through search results or video suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Browse Features -</strong> The homepage of your YouTube channel as well as the subscription feed and all other browse features can be a potential source of views for your videos. The YouTube users who watch a video on your channel can be either signed-in or signed-out, but the YouTube Analytics tool will still recognize their action as a view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Playlists -</strong> Producing content other YouTubers will want to include in their playlists is one of the best ways to attract more traffic and increase the amount of views videos you upload to your YouTube channel are getting.</p>
<h4 id="External-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#External-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="External Traffic Sources"></a>External Traffic Sources</h4><p> Even though YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, sharing a link to a video on social media such as Twitter or Facebook or embedding it on your website can significantly increase the number of views the video is getting.</p>
<p> Sources of traffic mentioned above are not equally effective, because the intent to actually watch the video varies greatly for each source. That’s why you’ll be able to achieve the best results if you combine several, if not all sources of traffic described in this guide.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics"><a href="#How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics" class="headerlink" title="How to Come Up With SEO Topics"></a>How to Come Up With SEO Topics</h3><p> Videos are a form of communication, and like with all forms of communication, you must know who you are addressing in order to know what to say. Defining the target audience before you start creating a video will make the SEO optimization process much simpler and much faster.</p>
<p> Let’s say that you want to become a successful beauty vlogger and your aim is to produce makeup tutorials. Your first step should be to determine which market is the most relevant for you. Assuming you’d like to target the Asian market, it becomes obvious that the audience you’ll be addressing will consist of women in need of practical makeup advice and your colleagues who offer similar types of tutorials.</p>
<p> Now that you’ve defined your target audience you can proceed to develop the content strategy. People search videos for many different reasons, but their motivation can be approximately divided into four micro-moments. These are:</p>
<p><strong>I want to know, I want to go, I want to do and I want to buy</strong> moments and some or all can be applied to all types of YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>I want to know moments</strong> refer to YouTube users who want to learn more about a certain topic and often ask how to perform a certain action. In the beauty niche, the search terms may include questions like ‘Is makeup bad for your skin?’ or ‘What is contouring?’.</p>
<p><strong>I want to do</strong> moments reflect a certain need the potential viewer of your videos has, and your video should provide a straightforward answer. Most common <strong>I want to do</strong> search patterns for beauty vloggers are ‘How to apply mascara, eyeliner, etc..’</p>
<p> If you know quite a bit about beauty products, then producing videos that rely on <strong>I want to buy</strong> moments is a sure way to attract a lot of traffic to your videos. These include product reviews, top ten videos or comparison videos that offer the reasons for and against buying a certain product.</p>
<p> Furthermore, you should try to think of a way to create a makeup video that makes the viewer feel involved, so even if you are just explaining the basic terms or tools in the video, viewers should have the feeling that they are learning something.</p>
<p> After defining your target audience and determining what you have to offer, you can choose the topic based on keywords. Here’s how you can easily come up with <strong>keyword ideas</strong> for your YouTube videos.</p>
<p> How to find the right keywords ideas?</p>
<p><strong>YouTube Search Suggestions:</strong></p>
<p> This is by far the easiest and fastest way to come up with an SEO friendly topic for a video. The best part is that the keywords you come up with will work without a doubt since all suggestions are based on search terms actual people have already used.</p>
<p><strong>Copy the Keywords From a Video in Your Niche that Already Has a Lot of Views:</strong></p>
<p> Study the competition and find a few channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers that cover the same topics as you. These channels probably have a significant number of videos so just sort them out using the ‘Most Popular’ option.</p>
<p> Click on a video that has the most views and that also has a topic that isn’t far removed from what you want to do. When the video is open, look for the keyword around which it is centered, in the title, description or tags and just find a creative way to incorporate it into your video.</p>
<p><strong>Use YouTube’s Traffic Sources and Search Report:</strong></p>
<p> If you would like to find out which keywords YouTubers have used to find your videos this is your best option. Even though the chances are you’ll know most keywords in the report since you already used them for SEO optimization of your videos, you might come up with a few unexpected entries that might be useful.</p>
<p> Look for low-competition keywords, because frequently used keywords are already used by videos featured on channels that have a lot of followers. Low-competition keywords can be particularly helpful if you are trying to grow your channel since they might attract more viewers than the most obvious keyword choices.</p>
<p> YouTube keyword tools:</p>
<p> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/youtube-keyword-tools.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="The-Metadata-Process"><a href="#The-Metadata-Process" class="headerlink" title="The Metadata Process"></a>The Metadata Process</h3><p> Now that you’ve found the best keywords for a video you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel, you should do everything in your power to maximize its SEO value. The following YouTube Ranking factors all play a part in the success your video will enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Video (Metadata)</li>
<li>Recommendations</li>
<li>Channel</li>
<li>User Action</li>
</ul>
<p> As you can see, metadata is directly related to the search rankings performance of your videos. So what is metadata exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Video file name:</strong> The SEO optimization of a YouTube video starts even before you upload the file to your channel. When naming a video file, make sure that the name contains a keyword, because the platform’s algorithm will analyze it and use it to determine how high it should be ranked in the search results.</p>
<p><strong>Video title:</strong> The title of a YouTube video is added after the upload is complete. So, in order to increase the video’s chances of appearing high in the search results, you should place the keyword at its begging and avoid using titles longer than 70 characters as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The more words you use to describe a video, the better. YouTube descriptions can have up to 5000 characters, which gives you quite a lot of room to use the keywords you’ve selected.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> You can hardly use too many tags, as a matter of fact, you should use as many tags as you can think of. Channel name, brand name, related keywords are all great choices for tags, just keep in mind that they can’t be longer than 127 characters.</p>
<p> YouTube tag generator:</p>

<p><strong>Transcript:</strong> Chances are that the keyword around which your video is based appears quite a lot in the narration and dialogue. YouTube lets you create transcripts of all your videos in just a few simple clicks, which enables you to take the SEO optimization a step further.</p>
<h3 id="Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing"><a href="#Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing"></a>Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing</h3><p> One of the greatest advantages YouTube offers is how easy it is to share the links to your videos on social media or anywhere else on the Internet. These off-channel marketing methods can help you drive more traffic to the videos you upload to YouTube:</p>
<p><strong>Embedding the Link:</strong> Articles covering topics similar to the topic your video is covering are a perfect place to embed a link to the video featured on your channel. What’s more, you can embed a link in your blog posts, on your website, or on a website of a partner company.</p>
<p><strong>Backlinks:</strong> A backlink is a link from some other website to the particular web resource, in this case, your video. You can insert links that offer additional information about the topic and by doing so increase the traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Website Promotion:</strong> Share links to videos you upload to YouTube on websites like Quora or forums such as Filmora.io.</p>
<p><strong>Team up with Other YouTube Creators:</strong> Looking for cooperation on Fiverr, or just send them private messages to ask for recommendation&#x2F;follow. Add your video in their playlist, or in Related Channel, End-screen card, etc.</p>

<p> If there exists searches, there exists SEO. YouTube now is the second largest search engine which processes more than 3 billion searches in a single month. Besides making sure that each video you upload to YouTube offers thought-provoking content, you can also optimize the video in accordance with the rules of SEO to stand out from the 500 hours of videos uploaded per minutes.</p>
<p> If you are trying to learn more about the SEO optimization of YouTube videos, you’ve landed on the right page, because in this guide we are going to take you through the process of improving the search rankings for each video you upload to YouTube.</p>

You have to know where the video’s traffic will come from, because over 500 hours of video content are being uploaded each minute, and there are over 50 million content creators on the platform.</p>

<p> That’s the reason why you have to develop a strategy that will attract the traffic to your videos and place them high in the YouTube’s search rankings. Let’s have a look at five traffic sources that will boost the number of views and comments videos are getting.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Search-1"><a href="#YouTube-Search-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Search"></a>YouTube Search</h4><p> A great deal of traffic for your videos can come from the search results, which makes the title of a video one of the most important aspects of SEO optimization on YouTube.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p> Don’t use long titles, strive to use short and catchy titles that also contain keywords which accurately describe the contents of the video in order to appear higher in the YouTube’s search results.</p>
<h4 id="Suggested-Videos-1"><a href="#Suggested-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Videos"></a>Suggested Videos</h4><p> The platform offers video suggestions that cover topics similar to those of the videos you already watched. Once more, the title and the description you provided will play a crucial role in driving more traffic to your videos, so make sure that each video you post on YouTube has an effective title that will spark interest in a potential viewer to take action and actually watch the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p> Suggested videos that appear from links in a video description.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Advertising-1"><a href="#YouTube-Advertising-1" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Advertising"></a>YouTube Advertising</h4><p> Investing in the promotion of the content you’re posting on your channel can help you to generate more views, but different types of YouTube ads produce different results. Non-skippable ads never count as a view, while a skippable ad that lasts more than ten seconds must be viewed for at least thirty seconds in order to qualify as a view. All other types of YouTube ads require the viewer to click on them and play them so the YouTube Analytics can recognize the action as a view.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-1"><a href="#Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-1" class="headerlink" title="Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists"></a>Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists</h4><p><strong>Channel Pages -</strong> This method of generating traffic includes views created by other channel owners as well as Topic Channels that are automatically created using the platform’s video discovery system. In either case, your videos are discovered through search results or video suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Browse Features -</strong> The homepage of your YouTube channel as well as the subscription feed and all other browse features can be a potential source of views for your videos. The YouTube users who watch a video on your channel can be either signed-in or signed-out, but the YouTube Analytics tool will still recognize their action as a view.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Playlists -</strong> Producing content other YouTubers will want to include in their playlists is one of the best ways to attract more traffic and increase the amount of views videos you upload to your YouTube channel are getting.</p>
<h4 id="External-Traffic-Sources-1"><a href="#External-Traffic-Sources-1" class="headerlink" title="External Traffic Sources"></a>External Traffic Sources</h4><p> Even though YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, sharing a link to a video on social media such as Twitter or Facebook or embedding it on your website can significantly increase the number of views the video is getting.</p>
<p> Sources of traffic mentioned above are not equally effective, because the intent to actually watch the video varies greatly for each source. That’s why you’ll be able to achieve the best results if you combine several, if not all sources of traffic described in this guide.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-1"><a href="#How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Come Up With SEO Topics"></a>How to Come Up With SEO Topics</h3><p> Videos are a form of communication, and like with all forms of communication, you must know who you are addressing in order to know what to say. Defining the target audience before you start creating a video will make the SEO optimization process much simpler and much faster.</p>
<p> Let’s say that you want to become a successful beauty vlogger and your aim is to produce makeup tutorials. Your first step should be to determine which market is the most relevant for you. Assuming you’d like to target the Asian market, it becomes obvious that the audience you’ll be addressing will consist of women in need of practical makeup advice and your colleagues who offer similar types of tutorials.</p>
<p> Now that you’ve defined your target audience you can proceed to develop the content strategy. People search videos for many different reasons, but their motivation can be approximately divided into four micro-moments. These are:</p>
<p><strong>I want to know, I want to go, I want to do and I want to buy</strong> moments and some or all can be applied to all types of YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>I want to know moments</strong> refer to YouTube users who want to learn more about a certain topic and often ask how to perform a certain action. In the beauty niche, the search terms may include questions like ‘Is makeup bad for your skin?’ or ‘What is contouring?’.</p>
<p><strong>I want to do</strong> moments reflect a certain need the potential viewer of your videos has, and your video should provide a straightforward answer. Most common <strong>I want to do</strong> search patterns for beauty vloggers are ‘How to apply mascara, eyeliner, etc..’</p>
<p> If you know quite a bit about beauty products, then producing videos that rely on <strong>I want to buy</strong> moments is a sure way to attract a lot of traffic to your videos. These include product reviews, top ten videos or comparison videos that offer the reasons for and against buying a certain product.</p>
<p> Furthermore, you should try to think of a way to create a makeup video that makes the viewer feel involved, so even if you are just explaining the basic terms or tools in the video, viewers should have the feeling that they are learning something.</p>
<p> After defining your target audience and determining what you have to offer, you can choose the topic based on keywords. Here’s how you can easily come up with <strong>keyword ideas</strong> for your YouTube videos.</p>
<p> How to find the right keywords ideas?</p>
<p><strong>YouTube Search Suggestions:</strong></p>
<p> This is by far the easiest and fastest way to come up with an SEO friendly topic for a video. The best part is that the keywords you come up with will work without a doubt since all suggestions are based on search terms actual people have already used.</p>
<p><strong>Copy the Keywords From a Video in Your Niche that Already Has a Lot of Views:</strong></p>
<p> Study the competition and find a few channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers that cover the same topics as you. These channels probably have a significant number of videos so just sort them out using the ‘Most Popular’ option.</p>
<p> Click on a video that has the most views and that also has a topic that isn’t far removed from what you want to do. When the video is open, look for the keyword around which it is centered, in the title, description or tags and just find a creative way to incorporate it into your video.</p>
<p><strong>Use YouTube’s Traffic Sources and Search Report:</strong></p>
<p> If you would like to find out which keywords YouTubers have used to find your videos this is your best option. Even though the chances are you’ll know most keywords in the report since you already used them for SEO optimization of your videos, you might come up with a few unexpected entries that might be useful.</p>
<p> Look for low-competition keywords, because frequently used keywords are already used by videos featured on channels that have a lot of followers. Low-competition keywords can be particularly helpful if you are trying to grow your channel since they might attract more viewers than the most obvious keyword choices.</p>
<p> YouTube keyword tools:</p>

<h3 id="The-Metadata-Process-1"><a href="#The-Metadata-Process-1" class="headerlink" title="The Metadata Process"></a>The Metadata Process</h3><p> Now that you’ve found the best keywords for a video you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel, you should do everything in your power to maximize its SEO value. The following YouTube Ranking factors all play a part in the success your video will enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Video (Metadata)</li>
<li>Recommendations</li>
<li>Channel</li>
<li>User Action</li>
</ul>
<p> As you can see, metadata is directly related to the search rankings performance of your videos. So what is metadata exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Video file name:</strong> The SEO optimization of a YouTube video starts even before you upload the file to your channel. When naming a video file, make sure that the name contains a keyword, because the platform’s algorithm will analyze it and use it to determine how high it should be ranked in the search results.</p>
<p><strong>Video title:</strong> The title of a YouTube video is added after the upload is complete. So, in order to increase the video’s chances of appearing high in the search results, you should place the keyword at its begging and avoid using titles longer than 70 characters as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The more words you use to describe a video, the better. YouTube descriptions can have up to 5000 characters, which gives you quite a lot of room to use the keywords you’ve selected.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> You can hardly use too many tags, as a matter of fact, you should use as many tags as you can think of. Channel name, brand name, related keywords are all great choices for tags, just keep in mind that they can’t be longer than 127 characters.</p>
<p> YouTube tag generator:</p>

<p><strong>Transcript:</strong> Chances are that the keyword around which your video is based appears quite a lot in the narration and dialogue. YouTube lets you create transcripts of all your videos in just a few simple clicks, which enables you to take the SEO optimization a step further.</p>
<h3 id="Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-1"><a href="#Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing"></a>Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing</h3><p> One of the greatest advantages YouTube offers is how easy it is to share the links to your videos on social media or anywhere else on the Internet. These off-channel marketing methods can help you drive more traffic to the videos you upload to YouTube:</p>
<p><strong>Embedding the Link:</strong> Articles covering topics similar to the topic your video is covering are a perfect place to embed a link to the video featured on your channel. What’s more, you can embed a link in your blog posts, on your website, or on a website of a partner company.</p>
<p><strong>Backlinks:</strong> A backlink is a link from some other website to the particular web resource, in this case, your video. You can insert links that offer additional information about the topic and by doing so increase the traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Website Promotion:</strong> Share links to videos you upload to YouTube on websites like Quora or forums such as Filmora.io.</p>
<p><strong>Team up with Other YouTube Creators:</strong> Looking for cooperation on Fiverr, or just send them private messages to ask for recommendation&#x2F;follow. Add your video in their playlist, or in Related Channel, End-screen card, etc.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-1"><a href="#How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Monitor a Video’s Data?"></a>How to Monitor a Video’s Data?</h3><p> YouTube Analytics is a tool that will enable you to find out more about the people who are watching your videos.

<p><strong>Playlists -</strong> Producing content other YouTubers will want to include in their playlists is one of the best ways to attract more traffic and increase the amount of views videos you upload to your YouTube channel are getting.</p>
<h4 id="External-Traffic-Sources-2"><a href="#External-Traffic-Sources-2" class="headerlink" title="External Traffic Sources"></a>External Traffic Sources</h4><p> Even though YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, sharing a link to a video on social media such as Twitter or Facebook or embedding it on your website can significantly increase the number of views the video is getting.</p>
<p> Sources of traffic mentioned above are not equally effective, because the intent to actually watch the video varies greatly for each source. That’s why you’ll be able to achieve the best results if you combine several, if not all sources of traffic described in this guide.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-2"><a href="#How-to-Come-Up-With-SEO-Topics-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Come Up With SEO Topics"></a>How to Come Up With SEO Topics</h3><p> Videos are a form of communication, and like with all forms of communication, you must know who you are addressing in order to know what to say. Defining the target audience before you start creating a video will make the SEO optimization process much simpler and much faster.</p>
<p> Let’s say that you want to become a successful beauty vlogger and your aim is to produce makeup tutorials. Your first step should be to determine which market is the most relevant for you. Assuming you’d like to target the Asian market, it becomes obvious that the audience you’ll be addressing will consist of women in need of practical makeup advice and your colleagues who offer similar types of tutorials.</p>
<p> Now that you’ve defined your target audience you can proceed to develop the content strategy. People search videos for many different reasons, but their motivation can be approximately divided into four micro-moments. These are:</p>
<p><strong>I want to know, I want to go, I want to do and I want to buy</strong> moments and some or all can be applied to all types of YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>I want to know moments</strong> refer to YouTube users who want to learn more about a certain topic and often ask how to perform a certain action. In the beauty niche, the search terms may include questions like ‘Is makeup bad for your skin?’ or ‘What is contouring?’.</p>
<p><strong>I want to do</strong> moments reflect a certain need the potential viewer of your videos has, and your video should provide a straightforward answer. Most common <strong>I want to do</strong> search patterns for beauty vloggers are ‘How to apply mascara, eyeliner, etc..’</p>
<p> If you know quite a bit about beauty products, then producing videos that rely on <strong>I want to buy</strong> moments is a sure way to attract a lot of traffic to your videos. These include product reviews, top ten videos or comparison videos that offer the reasons for and against buying a certain product.</p>
<p> Furthermore, you should try to think of a way to create a makeup video that makes the viewer feel involved, so even if you are just explaining the basic terms or tools in the video, viewers should have the feeling that they are learning something.</p>
<p> After defining your target audience and determining what you have to offer, you can choose the topic based on keywords. Here’s how you can easily come up with <strong>keyword ideas</strong> for your YouTube videos.</p>
<p> How to find the right keywords ideas?</p>
<p><strong>YouTube Search Suggestions:</strong></p>
<p> This is by far the easiest and fastest way to come up with an SEO friendly topic for a video. The best part is that the keywords you come up with will work without a doubt since all suggestions are based on search terms actual people have already used.</p>
<p><strong>Copy the Keywords From a Video in Your Niche that Already Has a Lot of Views:</strong></p>
<p> Study the competition and find a few channels with hundreds of thousands of subscribers that cover the same topics as you. These channels probably have a significant number of videos so just sort them out using the ‘Most Popular’ option.</p>
<p> Click on a video that has the most views and that also has a topic that isn’t far removed from what you want to do. When the video is open, look for the keyword around which it is centered, in the title, description or tags and just find a creative way to incorporate it into your video.</p>
<p><strong>Use YouTube’s Traffic Sources and Search Report:</strong></p>
<p> If you would like to find out which keywords YouTubers have used to find your videos this is your best option. Even though the chances are you’ll know most keywords in the report since you already used them for SEO optimization of your videos, you might come up with a few unexpected entries that might be useful.</p>
<p> Look for low-competition keywords, because frequently used keywords are already used by videos featured on channels that have a lot of followers. Low-competition keywords can be particularly helpful if you are trying to grow your channel since they might attract more viewers than the most obvious keyword choices.</p>

<h3 id="The-Metadata-Process-2"><a href="#The-Metadata-Process-2" class="headerlink" title="The Metadata Process"></a>The Metadata Process</h3><p> Now that you’ve found the best keywords for a video you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel, you should do everything in your power to maximize its SEO value. The following YouTube Ranking factors all play a part in the success your video will enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Video (Metadata)</li>
<li>Recommendations</li>
<li>Channel</li>
<li>User Action</li>
</ul>
<p> As you can see, metadata is directly related to the search rankings performance of your videos. So what is metadata exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Video file name:</strong> The SEO optimization of a YouTube video starts even before you upload the file to your channel. When naming a video file, make sure that the name contains a keyword, because the platform’s algorithm will analyze it and use it to determine how high it should be ranked in the search results.</p>
<p><strong>Video title:</strong> The title of a YouTube video is added after the upload is complete. So, in order to increase the video’s chances of appearing high in the search results, you should place the keyword at its begging and avoid using titles longer than 70 characters as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The more words you use to describe a video, the better. YouTube descriptions can have up to 5000 characters, which gives you quite a lot of room to use the keywords you’ve selected.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> You can hardly use too many tags, as a matter of fact, you should use as many tags as you can think of. Channel name, brand name, related keywords are all great choices for tags, just keep in mind that they can’t be longer than 127 characters.</p>

<p><strong>Transcript:</strong> Chances are that the keyword around which your video is based appears quite a lot in the narration and dialogue. YouTube lets you create transcripts of all your videos in just a few simple clicks, which enables you to take the SEO optimization a step further.</p>
<h3 id="Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-2"><a href="#Promoting-Videos-Using-Off-Channel-Marketing-2" class="headerlink" title="Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing"></a>Promoting Videos Using Off-Channel Marketing</h3><p> One of the greatest advantages YouTube offers is how easy it is to share the links to your videos on social media or anywhere else on the Internet. These off-channel marketing methods can help you drive more traffic to the videos you upload to YouTube:</p>
<p><strong>Embedding the Link:</strong> Articles covering topics similar to the topic your video is covering are a perfect place to embed a link to the video featured on your channel. What’s more, you can embed a link in your blog posts, on your website, or on a website of a partner company.</p>
<p><strong>Backlinks:</strong> A backlink is a link from some other website to the particular web resource, in this case, your video. You can insert links that offer additional information about the topic and by doing so increase the traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party Website Promotion:</strong> Share links to videos you upload to YouTube on websites like Quora or forums such as Filmora.io.</p>
<p><strong>Team up with Other YouTube Creators:</strong> Looking for cooperation on Fiverr, or just send them private messages to ask for recommendation&#x2F;follow. Add your video in their playlist, or in Related Channel, End-screen card, etc.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-2"><a href="#How-to-Monitor-a-Video’s-Data-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Monitor a Video’s Data?"></a>How to Monitor a Video’s Data?</h3><p> YouTube Analytics is a tool that will enable you to find out more about the people who are watching your videos. How many of your subscribers have watched a video you added to your channel? How many viewers found a video you uploaded through search results? The answer to these questions can be easily found with this tool.</p>
<p> YouTube Analytics also provides insight into subscriber conversion rates, so you can know exactly which videos attracted the most subscribers. This feature is particularly important if you are still developing your channel since it can help you understand which type of videos inspired a viewer to take action and hit the Subscribe button</p>
<p> Combining the information supplied by the YouTube Analytics with the data Google Analytics can offer will allow you to get to know the viewers of your videos better, which can be useful when planning the topics of the videos you’d like to upload to your YouTube channel in the future. If you’d like to gain access to more advanced statistics, there are a lot of free and paid YouTube analytics tools that enable you to keep track of the number of video comments, rankings, dislikes, likes, video replies or favorites.</p>
<p> Each of these metrics serves as a building block of a successful YouTube channel because uploading a video during a weekend or during the working days may not produce the same results. The YouTube analytics tools can assist you in staying one step ahead of your competition and increasing the number of subscribers to your YouTube channel.</p>
<h4 id="A-Few-Final-Thoughts-2"><a href="#A-Few-Final-Thoughts-2" class="headerlink" title="A Few Final Thoughts"></a>A Few Final Thoughts</h4><p> Just keep these fundamental things into your mind when you’re doing YouTube SEO:</p>

<p> That’s the reason why you have to develop a strategy that will attract the traffic to your videos and place them high in the YouTube’s search rankings. Let’s have a look at five traffic sources that will boost the number of views and comments videos are getting.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Search-3"><a href="#YouTube-Search-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Search"></a>YouTube Search</h4><p> A great deal of traffic for your videos can come from the search results, which makes the title of a video one of the most important aspects of SEO optimization on YouTube.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p> Don’t use long titles, strive to use short and catchy titles that also contain keywords which accurately describe the contents of the video in order to appear higher in the YouTube’s search results.</p>
<h4 id="Suggested-Videos-3"><a href="#Suggested-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Videos"></a>Suggested Videos</h4><p> The platform offers video suggestions that cover topics similar to those of the videos you already watched. Once more, the title and the description you provided will play a crucial role in driving more traffic to your videos, so make sure that each video you post on YouTube has an effective title that will spark interest in a potential viewer to take action and actually watch the video.</p>

<p> Suggested videos that appear from links in a video description.</p>
<h4 id="YouTube-Advertising-3"><a href="#YouTube-Advertising-3" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Advertising"></a>YouTube Advertising</h4><p> Investing in the promotion of the content you’re posting on your channel can help you to generate more views, but different types of YouTube ads produce different results. Non-skippable ads never count as a view, while a skippable ad that lasts more than ten seconds must be viewed for at least thirty seconds in order to qualify as a view. All other types of YouTube ads require the viewer to click on them and play them so the YouTube Analytics can recognize the action as a view.</p>
<h4 id="Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-3"><a href="#Channel-Pages-Browse-Features-Playlists-3" class="headerlink" title="Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists"></a>Channel Pages, Browse Features, Playlists</h4><p><strong>Channel Pages -</strong> This method of generating traffic includes views created by other channel owners as well as Topic Channels that are automatically created using the platform’s video discovery system. In either case, your videos are discovered through search results or video suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Browse Features -</strong> The homepage of your YouTube channel as well as the subscription feed and all other browse features can be a potential source of views for your videos. The YouTube users who watch a video on your channel can be either signed-in or signed-out, but the YouTube Analytics tool will still recognize their action as a view.</p>

<p> Creating a YouTube channel and uploading video content is only one part of the key to your success. With so much competition on the platform, it’s crucial that you stand out from the crowd with efficient, professional videos that are a pleasure to watch.</p>
<p> Without some planning and structure in mind before you begin filming, it’s all too easy to get a bit lost and start to ramble or fumble your words. Video’s filled with ‘umm’ and ‘err’ are neither pleasant to watch nor engaging.</p>
<p> If you’re serious about making a great YouTube channel and developing a loyal fan base, you’re going to need a workable structure for every video to help you stay on track. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Why is structuring your video important?</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">How should you structure YouTube Video Content?</a></li>
<li><a href="#part3">Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li>
<li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li>
<li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li>
</ul>
<p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p>
<h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p>
<h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p>
<p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p>
<h3 id="Main-content"><a href="#Main-content" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p>
<p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p>
<h3 id="Hook"><a href="#Hook" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p>
<p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p>
<h3 id="Outro"><a href="#Outro" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals. This is the point at which you can ask something back from your audience, whatever that may be. We call this a ‘call to action’, and it could eb something as simple as subscribing through to something more involved like visiting your website.</p>
<p> Think about what you want from your audience; what should they do next? Remember to ask via a strong call to action, otherwise you’ve simply given them some free advice with very little in the way of a return for you.</p>
<h3 id="Script-or-no-script"><a href="#Script-or-no-script" class="headerlink" title="Script or no script?"></a>Script or no script?</h3><p> Many YouTubers shy away from using any sort of script, feeling that this will make them less relatable and natural. Choosing whether or not to script is entirely up to you; some people feel more comfortable with a script to hand, whereas others prefer to just wing it as they go.</p>
<p> If you don’t feel a script would work for you, do consider having a very rough outline of your structure and the points you want to make readily available while filming. It will help you regain control if you do happen to lose your place and will ensure you get all the information across that you’d planned to.</p>
<p> If you do think a full script would work better for you, make sure you are able to come across as naturally as possible while reading it. Write your script the same way you speak and run through a few times so you’re not squinting at words while you’re on camera. If you regularly wander off script, this could be a sign that a freer flowing style is more your thing.</p>

If you’re unsure of the best structure for your content, watch videos made by others in your niche to see how they organize theirs.</p>
<p> That’s not to say you have to copy the leaders to be a success; indeed, you’ll be far more successful on YouTube if you continue to be unique. But there’s always room to learn from the best and to take inspiration from those who’ve been getting the very best results.</p>

If you regularly wander off script, this could be a sign that a freer flowing style is more your thing.</p>

<h5 id="Richard-Bennett-7"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-7" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p> Creating a YouTube channel and uploading video content is only one part of the key to your success. With so much competition on the platform, it’s crucial that you stand out from the crowd with efficient, professional videos that are a pleasure to watch.</p>
<p> Without some planning and structure in mind before you begin filming, it’s all too easy to get a bit lost and start to ramble or fumble your words. Video’s filled with ‘umm’ and ‘err’ are neither pleasant to watch nor engaging.</p>
<p> If you’re serious about making a great YouTube channel and developing a loyal fan base, you’re going to need a workable structure for every video to help you stay on track. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Quick Jump Menu</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Why is structuring your video important?</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">How should you structure YouTube Video Content?</a></li>
<li><a href="#part3">Ready to go out and make amazing videos?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-is-structuring-your-video-important-3"><a href="#Why-is-structuring-your-video-important-3" class="headerlink" title="Why is structuring your video important?"></a>Why is structuring your video important?</h2><p> The structure of your video can make all the difference between a successful YouTube channel and a big waste of time. Your objective is to get people watching more and watching all the way to the end. A great structure can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build interest and engagement</strong>: By keeping something in reserve and naturally building interest as you go along, people will be compelled to watch longer and interact more with your channel.</li>
<li><strong>Helps you rank higher</strong>: Longer and higher numbers of views will demonstrate your position as an authority well. The YouTube algorithm uses these metrics as part of their ranking factor, so the more and longer views you get, the higher you’ll rank in search.</li>
<li><strong>Builds consistency and familiarity</strong>: If all your videos follow a typical structure, your fans will come to be familiar with your format. They’ll know what to expect from your content and will watch more regularly as a result.</li>
</ul>
<p> So, now you understand why structure is so important to your channel, let’s take a look at ways in which you can create an amazing structure for every video you produce.</p>
<h2 id="How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content-3"><a href="#How-should-you-structure-YouTube-video-content-3" class="headerlink" title="How should you structure YouTube video content?"></a>How should you structure YouTube video content?</h2><p> There are some key elements of a YouTube video’s structure which can make it more natural, more engaging and more fun to watch. When you’re planning your structure, you should follow a logical timeline to take the viewer from start to finish easily, and to ensure you get the actions you want at the end.</p>
<h3 id="Intro-3"><a href="#Intro-3" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p> People love to be told what’s about to happen, and an intro can be a crucial step in ensuring they are going to continue watching your content. By explaining clearly what they are about to see, why it’s important to them and what problems you’re aiming to solve, you’ll keep them hooked and prevent them from browsing away to the next search result.</p>
<p> An introduction doesn’t need to be long or particularly involved. Remember, you don’t want to give away all your information here, as what you want is to encourage them to watch until the end. Something like “I’m going to show you … which will help you to …” is fine.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-structure.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p> Your idea and purpose need to be conveyed fast and effectively if you’re keen to get their interest. Most viewers will decide within the first three to five seconds of a video if they want to invest their time in watching, so it’s crucial you capture their interest and engage them fast to stop them drifting away.</p>
<h3 id="Main-content-3"><a href="#Main-content-3" class="headerlink" title="Main content"></a>Main content</h3><p> Once you’ve introduced your video, it’s time to start working through your content. This should be done by:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Framing the problem</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> What are the types of problems that your viewers will have encountered which your video can solve? How is the problem affecting you and your viewers? Take around two to three minutes to describe the problems that you hope your video will solve, and work on being empathetic so people can relate to you and the issue you’re discussing.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Offer solutions with examples</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> Move on to your solution to the problem. How did you find this solution? Is it easy to implement? Take around four to five minutes to address your solution and give examples of how it works in practice.</p>
<p> Now you’ve addressed the issue that your video content will solve, you’re almost ready to ask them to take the next step. Almost. There’s one more key element in your structure that you need to remember to include.</p>
<h3 id="Hook-3"><a href="#Hook-3" class="headerlink" title="Hook"></a>Hook</h3><p> The hook can be placed anywhere in your content, although it’s most successful when placed either in the introduction or while you are framing the problem. The hook is a tidbit that aims to encourage a full viewing of your video, so don’t give away your solutions but do give them a reason to carry on watching.</p>
<p> If there’s a particular point where you think they might become bored or distracted, this is a great time to insert your hook. Come up with a powerful hook, for instance ‘with my solution I managed to go from ten views to two hundred in an hour’ or ‘when you hear this solution you’ll understand how I tripled my profits overnight’. Give them a reason to want to stay to the end.</p>
<h3 id="Outro-3"><a href="#Outro-3" class="headerlink" title="Outro"></a>Outro</h3><p> Your outro shouldn’t just be about signing off in your unique way with some lovely music and visuals. This is the point at which you can ask something back from your audience, whatever that may be. We call this a ‘call to action’, and it could eb something as simple as subscribing through to something more involved like visiting your website.</p>
<p> Think about what you want from your audience; what should they do next? Remember to ask via a strong call to action, otherwise you’ve simply given them some free advice with very little in the way of a return for you.</p>
<h3 id="Script-or-no-script-3"><a href="#Script-or-no-script-3" class="headerlink" title="Script or no script?"></a>Script or no script?</h3><p> Many YouTubers shy away from using any sort of script, feeling that this will make them less relatable and natural. Choosing whether or not to script is entirely up to you; some people feel more comfortable with a script to hand, whereas others prefer to just wing it as they go.</p>
<p> If you don’t feel a script would work for you, do consider having a very rough outline of your structure and the points you want to make readily available while filming. It will help you regain control if you do happen to lose your place and will ensure you get all the information across that you’d planned to.</p>
<p> If you do think a full script would work better for you, make sure you are able to come across as naturally as possible while reading it. Write your script the same way you speak and run through a few times so you’re not squinting at words while you’re on camera. If you regularly wander off script, this could be a sign that a freer flowing style is more your thing.</p>
