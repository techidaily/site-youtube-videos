Even though Shorts is integrated within the YouTube app and still in beta, you can still edit your videos. At this writing, the only additional elements that you can add to your short videos are background music and captions. While these two are good enough to make your clips informative, they might not be able to attract as many viewers as there would have been if the footages were well-decorated with a couple of filters, effects, stickers, etc.

That said, listed below are some of the efficient and feature-packed third-party apps that can help you beautify your videos before they can be published as Shorts on your YouTube channel:

### Use Filmora to Create YouTube Shorts Video on PC

If you prefer to convert or make videos on a computer, I recommend you to try our [video editor Filmora X](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is an ideal solution for YouTubers.

You can make a vertical video with Filmora easily as it provides a 9:16 aspect ratio that works perfectly for editing YouTube Shorts videos. Compared with mobile apps, desktop softwares like Filmora allows you to add more elements and effects to your video to make it impressive. Check out the below video about how to edit vertical video using our Filmora X and try it out if you are impressed.

**Conclusion**

Making videos less than 60 seconds in duration and then publishing them on YouTube with the ‘#Shorts’ tag in the title or description lets you create short videos for YouTube. The apps listed above help you in this, and you can easily prepare attractive and engaging short clips pretty quickly using any of them. However, the most recommended, widely used, and the much-appreciated program is Wondershare Filmora that is not merely limited to mobile application-level features, it even has tools that usually compete with those available in the desktop software.
