## Part 1: The rules to know for each means earning money from YouTube

As a YouTube creator, finding ways to earn money from your content cannot be easy. Some creators make a living solely off their channels. Others supplement their income with affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and ad revenue. But if you want to earn money from YouTube truly, you need to understand which monetization methods work best for you and your content.

Here's what you should know when using each method and why you should consider doing so:

| **Methods**                                        | **Viewers/Clicks/Impressions**                                     | **Earnings/Commission**                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |

| **Brand Sponsorships**                             | 5K Sub 5K-30K Sub 30K-500K Sub 500K-1M+ Sub                        | $300 $700 $950 $3500                   |

| **Crowdfunding (Patreon, Indiegogo, GoFundMe) $5** | 100 subscribers funds the channel                                  | 100\*5=$500                            |

### YouTube Ads

The video ads on the platform aren't lucrative and can be used to supplement your income in the form of AdSense earnings. An actual advertiser pays 0.18 per ad view on average (as shown above). That means 1000 ad views equals $18 and $3-$5 per 1000 views.

### Brand Sponsorships

Brands can sponsor your videos to reach their target audience. YouTube videos are a big part of our lives, and brands are becoming increasingly aware of how useful these videos can be. To be eligible for sponsorship, your channel must be of 5000 subscribers.

### Affiliate Marketing

YouTubers help brands increase sales by encouraging their viewers to shop at the company's store or visit its specific product pages. They then earn a commission (30%-35%) on products that people buy after clicking an affiliate link.

### Merchandise Shelf

Your merchandise represents and feeds your audience's connection with you. Your product is your business, so you're first and foremost an entrepreneur. Then design your YouTube marketing strategy to sell your merchandise and generate income.

### Channel Membership

YouTube has a plan that allows you to charge your subscribers for membership on your YouTube channel. Members get access to exclusive live chats, badges, emojis, etc. Subscribers must give a set amount every month to a channel that makes a steady monthly income for YouTubers.

### Playback-based CPM

Your CPM (Cost Per Thousand) report tells you how much each ad was worth in terms of the percentage of each play a video was spent. The playback-based CPM report shows your estimated average gross revenue per 1000 playbacks where one or more ads are shown.

### Monthly estimated revenue

This is a simple report showing the statistics of your video earnings over the last 6 months. It can fluctuate by invalid traffic, content disputes and ad campaign types.

## Part 4: How much money can you make on YouTube?

The answer to that question can vary widely depending on the type of content you produce and the demographics of your target market. However, we've found that a single video ad can be worth anywhere from around $100 to $5,000.

It's safe to say that most YouTubers earn between $1,000 and $10,000 per month from their ads alone. But there are many other factors to take into consideration when calculating the money, you can make on YouTube:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The number of views your videos get

The key to making money from videos on YouTube is views. The more views you have, the more chance of getting paid will increase. So you need to create videos that will get viewers to click.

According to _Forbes's_ estimation, you can make $3-$5 per 1000 views. e.g., a video with 1,000,000 views can make around $5,000 on views only.

### The engagement level of your audience

When building a YouTube channel, the key to success lies in engaging with your audience. After all, if they don't like what you're offering, they will not watch your videos. So you've got to have a message that resonates and is useful.

### Your channel type

The YouTube algorithm is set up to favor channels with a high volume of views per video and high-quality content rather than low-quality channels that generate a lot of traffic but don't produce quality videos. So, if you want to increase your revenue from your YouTube videos, try to focus on high-quality content.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Your monetization method

Several monetization methods exist, including Subscription, advertising, affiliate marketing, paid search, and sponsorships. Each monetization method requires a slightly different setup and management, resulting in different revenue.

### The country you are in

It is important to know that in some countries, making money off YouTube is extremely difficult. For example, in certain countries, monetizing your videos is impossible without using illegal methods, which will get you into legal trouble.

Some other factors, e.g., it's worth comparing the RPM of your country and other countries, different rules and prices of YouTube Ads depending on your country.

Part 1: The rules to know for each means earning money from YouTube

As a YouTube creator, finding ways to earn money from your content cannot be easy. Some creators make a living solely off their channels. Others supplement their income with affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and ad revenue. But if you want to earn money from YouTube truly, you need to understand which monetization methods work best for you and your content.

Here's what you should know when using each method and why you should consider doing so:

| **Methods**                                        | **Viewers/Clicks/Impressions**                                     | **Earnings/Commission**                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **YouTube Ads $1 CPM**                             | 1 million Ad views                                                 | Average rate per ad=0.18Total \~ $5000 |
| **Brand Sponsorships**                             | 5K Sub 5K-30K Sub 30K-500K Sub 500K-1M+ Sub                        | $300 $700 $950 $3500                   |
| **Affiliate Marketing 30%-35% commission**         | If 100 people buys $20 product through affiliate link. Total $2000 | $2000\*35%= $700                       |
| **Crowdfunding (Patreon, Indiegogo, GoFundMe) $5** | 100 subscribers funds the channel                                  | 100\*5=$500                            |

### YouTube Ads

The video ads on the platform aren't lucrative and can be used to supplement your income in the form of AdSense earnings. An actual advertiser pays 0.18 per ad view on average (as shown above). That means 1000 ad views equals $18 and $3-$5 per 1000 views.

## Part 4: How much money can you make on YouTube?

The answer to that question can vary widely depending on the type of content you produce and the demographics of your target market. However, we've found that a single video ad can be worth anywhere from around $100 to $5,000.

It's safe to say that most YouTubers earn between $1,000 and $10,000 per month from their ads alone. But there are many other factors to take into consideration when calculating the money, you can make on YouTube:

### The number of views your videos get

The key to making money from videos on YouTube is views. The more views you have, the more chance of getting paid will increase. So you need to create videos that will get viewers to click.

According to _Forbes's_ estimation, you can make $3-$5 per 1000 views. e.g., a video with 1,000,000 views can make around $5,000 on views only.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The engagement level of your audience

When building a YouTube channel, the key to success lies in engaging with your audience. After all, if they don't like what you're offering, they will not watch your videos. So you've got to have a message that resonates and is useful.

### Your channel type

The YouTube algorithm is set up to favor channels with a high volume of views per video and high-quality content rather than low-quality channels that generate a lot of traffic but don't produce quality videos. So, if you want to increase your revenue from your YouTube videos, try to focus on high-quality content.

### Your monetization method

Several monetization methods exist, including Subscription, advertising, affiliate marketing, paid search, and sponsorships. Each monetization method requires a slightly different setup and management, resulting in different revenue.

### The country you are in

It is important to know that in some countries, making money off YouTube is extremely difficult. For example, in certain countries, monetizing your videos is impossible without using illegal methods, which will get you into legal trouble.

Some other factors, e.g., it's worth comparing the RPM of your country and other countries, different rules and prices of YouTube Ads depending on your country.

## Part 1: How to turn on AV1 settings on YouTube?

Do you wonder how to turn on **AV1 settings on YouTube**? For your information, AV1 is a video codec that is developed by a consortium of companies. It offers you advanced compression, enabling you to do smoother HD streaming and data savings for the video. Google also has already implemented AV1 use on YouTube. To turn on AV1 settings on YouTube, here are the steps:

##### Step1Go to playback and performance

![youtube settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-2.jpg)

* To turn on the AV1 settings, go to your YouTube account, after that click "Playback and Performance".
* In the AV1 settings. Besides "Auto (Recommended)", there are other two options, which are "Prefer AV1 for SD" and also "Always prefer SD".
* "Always Prefer AV1" uses the codec whenever it is available for a video while "Prefer AV1 for SD" limits it to SD videos. There are two options to avoid low-performance devices when AV1 videos are played on YouTube. You can select "Always Prefer AV1" to see if your device performance is good enough when you play videos on YouTube that support AV1.

##### Step2Test if the AV1 settings are already enabled in your video

You may ask how to confirm your YouTube videos are playing with AV1 Codec. Well, you can search playlist on YouTube with the keywords "[4K, 5K, and 8K videos with the new AV1 Codec](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJRxnLlXbB0ETtMprpLypZs68duRS1t1)". You can test it by playing one of the videos. You have to right-click on the media player and then select "Stats for nerd". If it shows the av01 codec there, then the AV1 settings are enabled already.

## Part 2: Why choose AV1 over VP9 and other formats?

Now, do you need a reason why you should choose AV1 compared to VP9 and the others? As you know, there is also another video codec like VP9\. There are also the others such as VVC, and many more. So what is the superiority of AV1 over the others? I will let you know why you should choose AV1 in this part.

The main thing is, as mentioned before, AV1 is developed by a consortium of companies founded in 2015\. It is supported by The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix, and also by web browser developers and semiconductor firms. Aomedia made it clear the algorithm is free-to-use. It means that there are no greedy negotiators that will be dependent on the developers.

![giant techs behind av1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-4.jpg)

Also, these days, with a format that provides a much smaller workload for internet providers. Their today focus is, that AV1 can reach the quality but can get the job done with 20% more efficiency. Then, with AV1 encoding, a "standard" 4K movie will be much more accessible than it is now. These are some more reasons why you should choose AV1.

### 1\. Royalty-free

As mentioned before, AV1 is royalty-free. AV1 is such a next-generation of royalty video codec. It means that it is not just free to use, but also free of charge, obligations, or even liability. It is an open and royalty-free video codec that the video platform will not charge to pay royalties to the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), the developer of video codecs.

![av1 is royalty-free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-5.jpg)

When it comes to the group that will ask for the royalty, MPEG is not the only one. There are also other patent groups and companies that can ask for it. Aomedia integrated Google, Mozilla, and Cisco, while they were busy creating their new video codec. However, the three companies joined together to create one codec to beat them all.

### 2\. Better performance

It is said that the AV1 codec is 30% more efficient. According to the tests conducted by Moscow State University, AV1 can outperform AV1 by about 28% in the efficiency of encoding and decoding. As per the performance graph from the Graphics & Media Lab Video Group, MSU below, AV1 can offer the exactly same quality as X264 at 55% of the average bitrate.

![av1 benefit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-settings-on-youtube-6.jpg)

AV1 is designed so exclusively to function better than all the other codecs in the market. It is an open-sourced codec with simple patent licensing, and the integration manages to save, as mentioned, up to 30% of the bandwidth for the exactly same image quality. In other words, with AV1, distributors can send streams much faster and cheaper and we can enjoy higher definitions in the same bandwidth.

### 3\. AV2 to come in the future

AV1 is undoubtedly superior if we compare it to other available video codecs and the exploration of the codec technology AV2 has already begun. This is such an early performance evaluation. There is some interesting part of the exploration development of AV2, such as multiple line selection for Intra prediction can make you select not just neighboring row/column for directional prediction. The same tool also exists in VVC.

There are also three essential improvements, which are simplifying the existing feature (also complete removal) and picking the tool used by VVC/H.266 (It is lack originality but so much work on it) and improvement periodically improvement of an existing tool, it is too few and also not original. We haven't known yet when AV2 will be done completely though, maybe there still be some more essential improvements.
