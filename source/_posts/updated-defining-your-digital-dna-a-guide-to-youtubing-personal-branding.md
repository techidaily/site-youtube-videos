How can you build a personal brand on YouTube that stands out?

YouTube is oversaturated. If you do comedy, fashion, gaming, vlogging, or any other major genre then you are competing with thousands of other channels. In order to grow you need to stand out, and that’s why it’s important to build a strong, clear, brand.

## Your Brand is Your Unique Message

Competing on YouTube is all about offering value. Viewers should be able to find something on your channel that they can’t find anywhere else. This doesn’t mean you need to bend over backwards trying to[invent brand new video ideas that nobody has ever tried before](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-be-original-on-youtube-289.html) – it just means you need to focus on building your unique brand. That is what will make viewers subscribe to you instead of just watching one of your videos and then clicking away.

## The Elevator Pitch

If you had 20 seconds – a short elevator ride – to describe your channel in a way that would make someone want to subscribe, what would you say?

Think about if you were trying to describe your new favorite show to a friend. You wouldn’t stop at saying ‘it’s a comedy’ or ‘it’s about lawyers’ – that doesn’t really tell them anything. You would describe the style of comedy, the personalities of characters you love, and the kinds of plots the show offers.

You need to be able to do that when you talk about your channel.

> What is your style of comedy?
>
> What is your attitude towards fashion?
>
> What will a viewer get out of watching you make pasta that they won’t get from watching someone else make pasta?

Work on developing an elevator pitch for your channel. It will help you define your brand for yourself, and it’ll be useful if you make a channel trailer.

## How to Start Building Your Brand

Building a brand should be intentional. You need to be yourself, but it’s not enough to just ‘be’. You need to create yourself.

  In order to figure out what unique value you’re bringing to YouTube you’ll need to [pay attention to your channel stats](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/understanding-youtube-analytics-%E2%80%93-take-charge-of-your-channel%21-286.html) and comments your viewers make. It can also be a good idea to ask for feedback from friends who you know will be honest with you.

You will notice patterns. There will be things you do in your video that people consistently like more and less. The way you build your brand is by cutting out the stuff that isn’t working and focusing more intentionally on the stuff that is. If people like it when you do meme humor, for example, do more meme humor and make incorporating that in your videos part of your brand.

Banners and thumbnails are also a part of your brand. [More on that here](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-youtube-banners-and-thumbnails-316.html).

## Being Consistent

The key to branding is consistency. People need to be able to set expectations.

For every video you do, ask yourself these questions:

> _Who are you?_
>
> _What is your message?_
>
> _What value are you providing?_
>
> _Who is it for?_

The answers to these questions make up your brand. They may change gradually over time – i.e. if you start making videos as a 16 year old, for other 16 year olds, then the ‘Who is it for?’ will change as you and your subscriber base get older – but in general the answers should always be the same. If your ‘message’ is positive and empowering, then it should always be positive and empowering.

When you intentionally create your personal brand on YouTube, you take charge of the message you're sending.

The video starts in black and white, with the boy band donning silk suits. After about 36 seconds, the color of the video changes. The choreography in the video reflects the upbeat and flirtatious vibe of this song. The band tried to put loads of emotions into it. Essentially, signature moves include brushing their hair back, kissing their hands, and giving a mischievous look.

Additionally, the video featured a technicolor elevator sequence whereby each member freestyles their dance moves. At one point, the septet forms the word ARMY using their bodies as a homage to their fans.

#### 2) Dynamite by BTS

Dynamite was released in August 2020, and it's the first song this South Korean boy band has recorded in English. The music video earned 100 million YouTube views in 23 hours and 25 minutes.

The upbeat disco-pop song has elements of bubblegum pop, soul, and funk, and it takes influence from the Seventies music. It features celebratory horns, echoing synths, and snapping handclaps. The song is about feeling joy and appreciation for the small things in life that make it valuable.

#### 3) How You Like That by Blackpink

Blackpink's How You Like That was recorded in two languages (Japanese and Korean. It was released through Interscope Records, YG Plus, and YG Entertainment. It's a club, trap, hip hop, EDM, and pop song. The music video took one day and eight hours to amass 100 million YouTube views, making it one of the fastest 100 million views on YouTube.

#### 4) Boy With Love by BTS and Halsey

Boy with Luv is the lead single for BTS' 6th extended play called Map of the Soul: Persona. Its release date is April 12, 2019, under Big Hit Entertainment. The video garnered 100 million views in one day and 13 hours.

The music video has vibrant visuals, and it starts with the American singer and songwriter Halsey sitting bored behind a booth that sells tickets. The scene then flashes to BTS, clad in different shades of hot pink and delivering their dynamic choreography in front of Persona, a retro movie theater. The cinematic visual then unfolds, setting the septet against kaleidoscopic backdrops, as they dance, rap, and sing.

#### 5) Ice Cream by Blackpink Featuring Selena Gomez

The video is visually-packed with ten set-ups and 13 outfit changes, making it exciting to watch. In the video, the artist appears sitting perched on an ornate throne, and she is adorned in gold jewelry with matching nails.

Lisa ascends to the throne while she's alternately executing excellent, intricate choreography.

#### 7) Permission to Dance by BTS

Permission to Dance was released July 9, 2021, through Sony Music and Big Hit Music as a stand-alone single. It's the group's third English-language single. Mac, Andrews, and Stephen Kirk were in charge of the production.

The music video hit 100 million views in two days and two hours. In the video, the boy band wears cowboy outfits and breaks their dance moves in the Western background. The theme of Permission to Dance looks like the end of the coronavirus pandemic as nations resume their normal activities and declare the worst of this disease seems to be behind them.

#### 8) Life Goes on by BTS

Released through Columbia Records and Big Hit Entertainment on November 20, 2020, Life Goes On is the lead single from BTS' 5th Korean-language studio album Be. It was produced by j-hope, SUGA, Antonia Armato, Chris James, Ruuth, RM, and Pdogg.

The video reached 100 million views on YouTube in 2 days and 3 hours. And this makes it among the fastest 100 million views on YouTube. The band appears to be lounging lazily, playing a video game. One of the members comes, V, with pizza, and they enjoy it together. V then takes the other members for a drive. When they came back, they watched some movies.

The music video begins with introduction shots of each member of Blackpink; they are in a room surrounded by trumpets. Jennie performs with 2 massive swan set pieces with the sunset behind her. Lisa then struts around a candy shop as she knocks things off shelves and kicks displays. The scene with Jisoo is a stark contrast, as we see the sun against a black setting with her head being above a pool of water. Next, viewers will see a distraught Rosé, as she's driving a sports car fast chasing down her doppelganger.

#### 10) Psy Gentleman

Gentleman, a K-pop song, was released on April 12, 2013\. It serves as the follow-up to Psy's hit single Gangnam Style.
