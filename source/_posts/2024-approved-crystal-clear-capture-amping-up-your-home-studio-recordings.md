### **1\. Silence everything you don’t want your microphone to record**

When you’re recording audio, you have to be more aware of the subtle sounds that drone on in your background. These sounds may include humming from machines with fans, buzzing from lights, and jingling from your pet’s collar. Observe your recording space and find ways to silence everything that you don’t want in your audio recording.

### **2\. Put your mobile phone in airplane mode**

Although it may be quite obvious to turn your phone’s ring tone off when you’re recording, it may not be as obvious to put your phone in airplane mode. When phones receive calls or perform searches as part of their background processes, they emit signals that can get picked up by your recording system. Avoid ruining good takes with unwanted sounds of phone signals by putting your phones in airplane mode.

### **3\. Minimize echo**

If you are recording yourself talk or sing, make sure to set up your recording space in a way where the sound projected from your voice bounces minimally off the walls and back to your microphone. Bare walls and hardwood floors will cause a lot of bouncing. Make use of materials that will absorb your sound rather than bounce it, like a thick rug or a comforter. If you want your voice to echo, that’s something you should do in post-production.

### **4\. Block wind from reaching your microphone**

Although it might not sound so loud and distracting to the naked ear, wind sounds terribly loud through a microphone recording and can cause your audio to clip (distortion of waveform due to output of sound exceeding maximum capacity or 0 dB point). This includes the “wind” that comes out of your mouth when you pronounce words starting with the letter “p.” Use pop filters, windscreens, and deadcats to block wind from reaching your microphone.

### **5\. Upgrade your microphone**

As much as you try to control all the noise in your surroundings, your greatest recording limitation will come from the hardware that you use. Improve your recordings by plugging in an external microphone into your camera’s microphone jack or record audio completely separately with a professional microphone.

Need help with deciding on a microphone to buy? Check out our recommended list of microphones.

### **6\. Adjust your levels**

Before pressing the record button, see how loudly your microphone picks up the sound you wish to record. Adjust your levels (sensitivity of your microphone) until the sound sits in between -6 dBs and -12dBs. This range gives the source of your sound some room to get louder without the recorded audio getting clipped. When you first listen to audio recorded within this range, it may sound very quiet. No need to worry though because you can increase the volume later in editing.

### **7\. Start with a sound cue if you’re planning to do some syncing in post**

If you’re recording separate audio that you plan to sync to your video later in editing, start your recording with a short and loud sound cue like a clap or a high pitched “beep” tone. Later, when you’re editing, it’ll be much easier for you to find the section where your video and additional audio match.

### **8\. Get close to the sound**

Unless you’re aiming to record ambient sound, bring your microphone close to the source of sound you are wanting to record. The closer your microphone is to the source of sound, the lower your sensitivity setting can be on your microphone. As a result of lowering your levels, sounds you are not meaning to record will also sound fainter.

### **9\. ADR**

When you need to record a scene in a loud setting where you have very little control over the noise, record additional vocals later and replace the original vocals through a process called automated dialogue replacement.

### **10\. Record Ambient Sound**

Remember to record ambient sound or “room tone.” You can use these recordings to fill in the blanks if you run out of audio and also smooth out parts of your audio where you hear pops, clicks, and other unwanted noise.

## What Is YouTube Studio?

YouTube Studio is a free, cloud-based video production software. It's the ideal way to create, distribute, and measure the overall success of your films on YouTube, Google+, and the web. It provides powerful editing tools, real-time feedback on how your films are performing, and one-click posting from your PC or smartphone. YouTube Studio provides several features:

#### 1\. Manages Multiple Channels

YouTube Studio makes managing a couple of channels a lot easier. You can see all of your channels on one screen and switch from one to the other without difficulty. Simply select Manage Channels from the account icon in the top right corner. When you have a lot of money owing to you, you can modify it.

#### 2\. Get Real-Time Data On Your Channels

It's critical to monitor where your YouTube channel is at all times as a YouTube content creator. If you want to access your YouTube channel analytics and use all of the other equipment and features in the app, go to the analytics section of the menu.

#### 2\. Get Real-Time Data On Your Channels

It's critical to monitor where your YouTube channel is at all times as a YouTube content creator. If you want to access your YouTube channel analytics and use all of the other equipment and features in the app, go to the analytics section of the menu.

#### 3\. Make video edits

The YouTube Studio app is most useful for creating fast, vlog-style videos, but it can also handle other types of material. With titles, photographs and captions, transitions, and even music, it could create a number of videos with different purposes.

#### 4\. Scheduled Video Uploads

A few films will need to be posted later, given a content creator's schedule or habit. When you're in the publishing section of your project, you'll see a visibility option that lets you schedule the release of your video.

#### 5\. Add more Users

It is possible to add partners to the studio if you are working on a project requiring teamwork. To make this option available, go to your settings and then adjust permissions. Authenticate the account you're using and click the + symbol to add other users.

## Is YouTube Studio editor enough for editing videos?

For film editing, YouTube's video editor is insufficient. It includes a few basic features, but if you want to do some serious altering, you'll need a third-party program.

Modern video editing software is fairly complex, and it allows you to make professional-looking movies without a lot of training. Several video editing tools are available that take things to the next level. They can use unique effects, transitions, and even 360-degree rotation to change the scene. Here are a few video editors to choose from.

#### 1\. Adobe Premiere Pro

![alternative youtube video editor - PR](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-studio-video-editor-3.png)

Adobe's most essential seasoned academic courses will teach you how to utilize the video editing program as well as its advanced features.
