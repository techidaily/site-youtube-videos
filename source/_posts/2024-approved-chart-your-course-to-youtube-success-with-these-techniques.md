## 1\. Post YouTube Videos Consistently

In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to [keep posting constantly](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html). Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.

## 2\. Provide Value in Each Video

Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.

## 3\. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a 'CTA'

Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘[call to action](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.

One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to [brand-new viewers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html) for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.

## 4\. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community

YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to [gain support for your videos](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html). It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.

Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to [appear in one of their videos](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html) or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.

## 5\. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them

Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.

Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.

## 6\. Find a Niche for Your Videos

Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and [niches](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html) for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.

Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.

## 7\. Build a Strong Personal Brand

[Building a brand on YouTube](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html) is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your [channel art](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html) are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.

Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.

## 8\. Create Custom Channel Art

To differentiate yourself from your competition you're going to need to have [custom Channel Art](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html) that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.

## 9\. Practice Makes Perfect

In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.

Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you're working with will[save you time when you’re actually polishing a video](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html). Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.

Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.

## 10\. Add a YouTube Intro Video

A professional-looking intro clip ([learn how to make one here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.

 _Contest now closed._

## 11\. Use Video Effects and Transitions

Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.

Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.

It can take some time to [add these kinds of effects to your videos](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html), but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.

## 12\. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails

A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva ([or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html)). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).

## 13\. Use Lots of YouTube Tags

Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. [Tags should include keywords/search terms](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html) people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.

Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords/tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.

## 14\. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time

[Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html), an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it's much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.

Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.

## 15\. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media

Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often [the promotion that you do through social media](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html) can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.

## 16\. Interact with your Viewers

Spending time [interacting with your viewers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-youtube-audience-283.html) via comments and social media is important. Taking suggestions and paying attention to what your viewers like most about your videos will make your viewers feel more included in the process of creating your videos. This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&A videos.

## 17\. Check Out the Big Channels in Your Genre

Spending time [examining your competition](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/your-youtube-rivals---how-to-get-more-views-by-checking-out-the-competition-62.html) is very important. By looking at the popular channels in your genre you can learn what kinds of videos are popular and what types of video titles and tags you should be using.

## 18\. Do Collaboration Videos

When you [collaborate with other YouTube creators](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html) it leads to mutual success. You can cross-promote some of their content and they can promote some of your content in the process. It's amazing how much your channel can grow when you’re exposed to other people’s audiences. Even if you might view another content creator is your competition, sometimes uniting together on a project can help you to mutually prosper.

Make sure your potential partner makes the kinds of videos your own audience would like. Then you’ll know that your videos are something your partner’s audience will like.

## 19\. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video

The description box is one of the most commonly underutilized tools on YouTube. Make sure that you use the space to write a full description of each video. In the first three lines of every video description, use the keywords most relevant to your content, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Lower down in your description, under the ‘read more’ tab, write a detailed summary of your video. This will improve your SEO/search engine optimization.

## 20\. Use Keywords That Are Searchable

In your titles, descriptions, and tags you need to use the words or phrases that viewers are most likely to type into YouTube’s search bar when looking for content like yours. Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.

For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.

## 21\. Make your Thumbnails Consistent

The thumbnails that you choose for your videos can be an extension of your brand. By using similar layouts, colors, and fonts for every thumbnail you will [create a familiar look](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-video-thumbnails-for-youtube-288.html) and viewers will recognize your videos when they see them. If someone can instantly recognize your video thumbnails it will strengthen your brand and encourage repeat viewership.

## 22\. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos

If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.

## 23\. Make Titles that Get Views

Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.

## 24\. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer

Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe. YouTube allows you to set a featured video that will autoplay in this space, and a lot of the most successful creators use this as an opportunity to post a [channel trailer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Your channel trailer welcomes new viewers and tells them what to expect from your content.

You can create a trailer quickly by filming a quick introduction and combining it with clips from your previous videos.

## 25\. Give Each of Your Videos a Memorable Ending

Ending every video on a high note – with some kind of joke or surprise – will leave viewers with a good feeling, which will make them more likely to keep watching more of your videos.

 Be sure to share your own tips on how to get your YouTube channel noticed.

By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often [the promotion that you do through social media](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html) can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.

## 16\. Interact with your Viewers

Spending time [interacting with your viewers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-youtube-audience-283.html) via comments and social media is important. Taking suggestions and paying attention to what your viewers like most about your videos will make your viewers feel more included in the process of creating your videos. This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&A videos.

## 17\. Check Out the Big Channels in Your Genre

Spending time [examining your competition](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/your-youtube-rivals---how-to-get-more-views-by-checking-out-the-competition-62.html) is very important. By looking at the popular channels in your genre you can learn what kinds of videos are popular and what types of video titles and tags you should be using.

## 18\. Do Collaboration Videos

When you [collaborate with other YouTube creators](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html) it leads to mutual success. You can cross-promote some of their content and they can promote some of your content in the process. It's amazing how much your channel can grow when you’re exposed to other people’s audiences. Even if you might view another content creator is your competition, sometimes uniting together on a project can help you to mutually prosper.

Make sure your potential partner makes the kinds of videos your own audience would like. Then you’ll know that your videos are something your partner’s audience will like.

## 19\. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video

The description box is one of the most commonly underutilized tools on YouTube. Make sure that you use the space to write a full description of each video. In the first three lines of every video description, use the keywords most relevant to your content, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Lower down in your description, under the ‘read more’ tab, write a detailed summary of your video. This will improve your SEO/search engine optimization.

## 20\. Use Keywords That Are Searchable

In your titles, descriptions, and tags you need to use the words or phrases that viewers are most likely to type into YouTube’s search bar when looking for content like yours. Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.

For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.

## 21\. Make your Thumbnails Consistent

The thumbnails that you choose for your videos can be an extension of your brand. By using similar layouts, colors, and fonts for every thumbnail you will [create a familiar look](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-video-thumbnails-for-youtube-288.html) and viewers will recognize your videos when they see them. If someone can instantly recognize your video thumbnails it will strengthen your brand and encourage repeat viewership.

## 22\. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos

If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.

## 23\. Make Titles that Get Views

Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.

## 24\. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer

Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe. YouTube allows you to set a featured video that will autoplay in this space, and a lot of the most successful creators use this as an opportunity to post a [channel trailer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Your channel trailer welcomes new viewers and tells them what to expect from your content.

You can create a trailer quickly by filming a quick introduction and combining it with clips from your previous videos.

## 25\. Give Each of Your Videos a Memorable Ending

Ending every video on a high note – with some kind of joke or surprise – will leave viewers with a good feeling, which will make them more likely to keep watching more of your videos.

 Be sure to share your own tips on how to get your YouTube channel noticed.

## 1\. Post YouTube Videos Consistently

In order to consistently draw viewers back your page and get the most out of your content, you need to be able to [keep posting constantly](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-often-should-you-upload-to-youtube--consistent-posting-gets-views-187.html). Only posting sporadically when you feel like it – three times one month, then just once the next – will not encourage viewers to subscribe. If you develop a schedule and regularly post content each week (or every day if you’re really ambitious), your viewers can start to expect when a video will be released. Some of the best content creators will continue to release videos at least a few times a week in order to continuously draw an audience back to their channel.

## 2\. Provide Value in Each Video

Before you turn your camera on and start making a new video, ask yourself what value you want your viewers to take away from it. Will they come away from your video with knowledge, a new skill, or a feeling of amusement? Be sure to have a clear objective in mind with every video.

## 3\. Ask Viewers to Subscribe with a 'CTA'

Asking viewers to do anything (like, subscribe, etc.) is called a CTA, or ‘[call to action](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)’. Asking for subscribers is a call to action that needs to be included in every video.

One of the objectives of every video you produce should be to try and appeal to [brand-new viewers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-convert-viewers-into-subscribers-%28the-easy-way%29-287.html) for your page. Something as simple as asking the viewer to subscribe if they liked your video can really help you grow faster. Sometimes people who really love your content still need to be reminded to subscribe. It is important to attract subscribers – not just viewers – in order to make sure that you have reliable, ongoing, support for your videos.

## 4\. Spend Time Building your YouTube Community

YouTube is a large community and consistently interacting with other creators will help you to [gain support for your videos](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-one-proven-282.html). It helps a lot if the people in your genre know you. You can watch each other’s videos, give each other constructive feedback, and there may even be opportunities for collaboration.

Many video creators draw inspiration from each other’s videos and even spend time working with each other and promoting each other’s content. If you consistently comment on someone’s videos, without asking them to check out your channel (most people find this annoying), they will probably decide to go look at your videos too. Eventually, you might even find an opportunity to [appear in one of their videos](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html) or have them appear in one of your videos so that you can each be exposed to new potential viewers.

## 5\. Set YouTube Goals and Announce Them

Setting goals for yourself – i.e. reaching a certain number of subscribers – and letting your viewers know is a great way to meet your goals faster.

Sharing your goals helps your community feel more engaged and like they are a bigger part of your channel. This can be an excellent marketing tactic. When you share your goals, they become your follower’s goals too and they will help you reach them. Creating a payoff where your subscribers can help you reach 2000 subscribers or 1000 likes on a video can help you accomplish more goals to sustain the longevity of your channel. It also fosters a feeling of community by uniting everyone together and allowing them to share your feeling of accomplishment. This works especially well if you offer a reward – i.e. ‘I’ll do a special video when I reach 2000 subscribers’.

## 6\. Find a Niche for Your Videos

Many creators on YouTube have found success by carving out very specific video types and [niches](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-find-your-niche-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-the-280.html) for themselves. When you are hoping to grow your subscribers on YouTube you really need to find your niche. When you can start to create videos that have predictable subject matter (predictable in the sense of ‘reliable’, not boring), this will attract more regular viewers because people will know what they can expect from your content. Having a niche can also help you find brand deals because you’ll grow a very specific audience that might be interested in very specific products. A smaller, targeted, the audience can be more valuable to an advertiser than a larger, more general, audience.

Your niche will generally be a combination of your larger genre (i.e. gaming, comedy, beauty, food) and something else you are passionate about. For example, reviewing vintage video games or creating desserts based on movies are both potential niches.

## 7\. Build a Strong Personal Brand

[Building a brand on YouTube](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-brand-on-youtube-%E2%80%93-what-makes-279.html) is one of the best ways to generate a devoted following. Building a brand is very important because it makes you more memorable and familiar to viewers. In order to successfully build a brand, you need to think about the image you are trying to create and the culture you want to create for your community. The values you express, the types of videos you do, the clothes you wear, and your [channel art](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-5-youtube-channel-art-makers-299.html) are all parts of your brand. The grand total of all of these elements will form your brand and the way you are perceived.

Having a strong, unique, the brand will make viewers feel more attached to you and make your content more recognizable.

## 8\. Create Custom Channel Art

To differentiate yourself from your competition you're going to need to have [custom Channel Art](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-design-your-youtube-channel-art-2-ways-230.html) that reflects the vibe of your content. Work at creating or sourcing some graphics for your cover photo, your profile photo, and all of your thumbnails. Having a set color scheme or even a branded style of artwork for your page will help you to look more professional. Differentiating your page from others will create a feeling of familiarity and support your brand.

## 9\. Practice Makes Perfect

In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.

Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you're working with will[save you time when you’re actually polishing a video](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html). Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.

Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.

## 10\. Add a YouTube Intro Video

A professional-looking intro clip ([learn how to make one here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.

 _Contest now closed._

## 11\. Use Video Effects and Transitions

Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.

Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.

It can take some time to [add these kinds of effects to your videos](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html), but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.

## 12\. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails

A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva ([or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html)). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).

## 13\. Use Lots of YouTube Tags

Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. [Tags should include keywords/search terms](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html) people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.

Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords/tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.

## 14\. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time

[Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html), an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it's much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.

Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.

## 15\. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media

Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often [the promotion that you do through social media](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html) can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.

This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&A videos.

## 17\. Check Out the Big Channels in Your Genre

Spending time [examining your competition](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/your-youtube-rivals---how-to-get-more-views-by-checking-out-the-competition-62.html) is very important. By looking at the popular channels in your genre you can learn what kinds of videos are popular and what types of video titles and tags you should be using.

## 9\. Practice Makes Perfect

In order to start producing more professional content, you need to practice your filmmaking technique. Regardless of the type of video that you are producing, a little bit of practice goes a long way.

Rehearsing what you are going to say can make you feel much more confident. Playing with the video editing software that you're working with will[save you time when you’re actually polishing a video](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/faster-rendering-faster-uploads-and-other-post-production-speed-hacks-211.html). Practicing taking photos and videos with your camera outside of making YouTube videos will help you feel familiar with its features. As you start to get more dedicated and practice with your video creation, your videos will gain more viewers and you can grow more subscribers on YouTube.

Simply making more videos is a great way to get in more practice.

## 10\. Add a YouTube Intro Video

A professional-looking intro clip ([learn how to make one here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)) supports your brand and makes your videos seem more polished. Intros capture attention and let viewers know the type of video that they are watching almost immediately. Building a 5-10 second introduction (no longer) with your name or the name of your channel will go a long way to improving the professionalism of your video.

## 11\. Use Video Effects and Transitions

Adding transitions between clips or topics is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your videos.

Using simple color effects, like filters, can help each of your videos look much more professional.

It can take some time to [add these kinds of effects to your videos](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-edit-a-youtube-video-and-get-more-subscribers-281.html), but it isn’t really very difficult (many editors, including Filmora, let you drag and drop these effects into your timeline) and it will help your videos hold viewers’ attention for longer. It can also garner much more engagement and many more subscriptions for your YouTube channel.

## 12\. Make Eye-Catching Thumbnails

A thumbnail that grabs a viewer’s attention will get more clicks. Take a photo of yourself making an expression relevant to your video and edit the image in Photoshop or using a free service like Canva ([or one of these other YouTube thumbnail makers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/top-10-youtube-thumbnail-makers---easy-to-use%21-312.html)). Add graphics, like emojis, to give your thumbnail a pop of color and include large, simple, text if you feel like your thumbnail needs to be given context (i.e. ‘fall makeup look’, as opposed to just another makeup video).

## 13\. Use Lots of YouTube Tags

Tags are essential to helping people actually find your videos on YouTube. [Tags should include keywords/search terms](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html) people might be looking up in order to find videos like yours. Looking at the tags of some of your past videos and seeing how well they performed will give you an idea of what kinds of tags you should target in the future. Looking at the tags of some of your competitors will give you an idea of what tags you should be using for your own videos.

Services like the Google Keyword Planner can also help you with finding new keywords/tags. Making your tags with search engine optimization in mind will help ensure that people can find your video when searching for those specific keywords. YouTube has an algorithm very similar to the Google search engine for helping people locate videos they may be interested in.

## 14\. Use YouTube Playlists to Increase Watch Time

[Playlists are great for increasing your channel’s watch time](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html), an essential metric for ranking in YouTube’s search results. If someone enjoys your video enough to watch to the end, and then a related video starts to play right after, it's much more likely that the user is going to stick around and view the second video. When you start to link videos together you will start to see your views grow.

Playlists are also important because they help to organize your channel and make it easier for viewers to find content they are interested in.

## 15\. Promote Your YouTube Channel on Social Media

Improving engagement as well as the notoriety of your brand often means branching out beyond YouTube. By creating accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram for your channel you will gain more ways of engaging your followers. Often [the promotion that you do through social media](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/5-ways-to-use-social-media-to-grow-your-youtube-channel-97.html) can equate to a large number of viewers and subscribers. The key to expanding into other social media platforms is to choose the sites your existing audience is already on. For example, Instagram is essential for a beauty YouTuber, but not for a gamer.

## 16\. Interact with your Viewers

Spending time [interacting with your viewers](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-build-a-youtube-audience-283.html) via comments and social media is important. Taking suggestions and paying attention to what your viewers like most about your videos will make your viewers feel more included in the process of creating your videos. This will make them much more loyal to your channel. A great way to interact with your viewers is by doing shout outs or Q&A videos.

## 17\. Check Out the Big Channels in Your Genre

Spending time [examining your competition](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/your-youtube-rivals---how-to-get-more-views-by-checking-out-the-competition-62.html) is very important. By looking at the popular channels in your genre you can learn what kinds of videos are popular and what types of video titles and tags you should be using.

## 18\. Do Collaboration Videos

When you [collaborate with other YouTube creators](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-a-collaboration-video-on-youtube-285.html) it leads to mutual success. You can cross-promote some of their content and they can promote some of your content in the process. It's amazing how much your channel can grow when you’re exposed to other people’s audiences. Even if you might view another content creator is your competition, sometimes uniting together on a project can help you to mutually prosper.

Make sure your potential partner makes the kinds of videos your own audience would like. Then you’ll know that your videos are something your partner’s audience will like.

## 19\. Write a Detailed Description for Every Video

The description box is one of the most commonly underutilized tools on YouTube. Make sure that you use the space to write a full description of each video. In the first three lines of every video description, use the keywords most relevant to your content, provide links to your other social media accounts, and ask viewers to subscribe. Lower down in your description, under the ‘read more’ tab, write a detailed summary of your video. This will improve your SEO/search engine optimization.

## 20\. Use Keywords That Are Searchable

In your titles, descriptions, and tags you need to use the words or phrases that viewers are most likely to type into YouTube’s search bar when looking for content like yours. Doing a bit of keyword research will help you gain more subscribers on YouTube and more viewers on almost every video.

For example, if you do a product review of a new smartphone, you will get a lot more views titling it ‘iPhone X Review and Unboxing’ than ‘You won’t BELIEVE this phone’ because iPhone X, review and unboxing are all keywords that people might search for.

 _Contest now closed._

## 21\. Make your Thumbnails Consistent

The thumbnails that you choose for your videos can be an extension of your brand. By using similar layouts, colors, and fonts for every thumbnail you will [create a familiar look](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-video-thumbnails-for-youtube-288.html) and viewers will recognize your videos when they see them. If someone can instantly recognize your video thumbnails it will strengthen your brand and encourage repeat viewership.

## 22\. Always Have a Plan for Your Videos

If you can plan out a script or outline (whichever you’re comfortable with) for your video, or even plan out a series of videos that you could shoot over time, it can lead to far better content. Taking the time to create a plan for every single video will lead to much more polished results that will generate far better responses from your viewers. Planning takes time, but not as much time as trying to edit the content that had no clear plan.

## 23\. Make Titles that Get Views

Writing great titles that are optimized for search engines is one of the best ways to see some huge improvements in your channel’s growth rate. Your titles need to be able to draw in an audience and get them interested in your content. They also have to set expectations for your videos and contain the right keywords to make them searchable. Big channels can get good results with titles that build suspense or ask questions, but while you’re small it’s better to avoid clickbait and make your titles as direct and literal as possible.

## 24\. Create a YouTube Channel Trailer

Your channel page on YouTube might be where a viewer makes the decision to subscribe, or not to subscribe. YouTube allows you to set a featured video that will autoplay in this space, and a lot of the most successful creators use this as an opportunity to post a [channel trailer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Your channel trailer welcomes new viewers and tells them what to expect from your content.

You can create a trailer quickly by filming a quick introduction and combining it with clips from your previous videos.

## 25\. Give Each of Your Videos a Memorable Ending

Ending every video on a high note – with some kind of joke or surprise – will leave viewers with a good feeling, which will make them more likely to keep watching more of your videos.

 Be sure to share your own tips on how to get your YouTube channel noticed.

## How to Prepare Before Making Your First Travel Video?

Now when you have got a glimpse of some of the best travel YouTube channels, you must be inspired to create your content as well. To work on memorable travel videos, I would recommend the following suggestions.

#### Record tons of footage

Most importantly, make sure that you have recorded a lot of content that you can include in your videos. You can later get rid of any content that you don’t like. Though, if you don’t have the right footage, then you won’t be able to create your video in the first place.

#### Focus on one thing at a time

While traveling, you can get overwhelmed and might try to include a lot of things in a single video. Instead, try to focus on one central idea for the video. For instance, you can make a video on your visit to a local market or a historic site. If you want to include more, then make a video collage of the entire trip.

#### Add voiceovers

A lot of content creators might not realize this, but voiceovers are extremely important in travel videos. Apart from the visual shots, you should include your experience of what you felt at that time. If you didn’t record your reaction in the original video, then use an editing tool like Filmora to add voiceovers later on.

#### Add voiceovers

A lot of content creators might not realize this, but voiceovers are extremely important in travel videos. Apart from the visual shots, you should include your experience of what you felt at that time. If you didn’t record your reaction in the original video, then use an editing tool like Filmora to add voiceovers later on.

#### Edit your videos with an excellent video editor

If you wish to come up with appealing travel videos, then a video editor would be a must-have tool for you. I would recommend using **Wondershare Filmora**, which is one of the most extensive and user-friendly video editors out there. You can easily clip the footage of your choice, add voiceovers, and include different transitions. There are tons of presets and media layers that you can include in your videos to make them stand out.

#### Be authentic

In the end, make sure that you share a genuine experience with others. Try not to overly glorify a thing or provide a partial experience in your travel videos. Be authentic and share your experience while traveling to come up with personal yet beautifully-shot videos.

I’m sure that after reading this post on some of the best travel YouTube channels, you must be inspired as well. You can watch these channels to know more about a destination you are planning to visit or learn how to make interesting travel videos. To edit your videos, you can just take the assistance of a reliable application like Filmora and come up with stunning clips in less time.

## How to Prepare Before Making Your First Travel Video?

Now when you have got a glimpse of some of the best travel YouTube channels, you must be inspired to create your content as well. To work on memorable travel videos, I would recommend the following suggestions.

#### Record tons of footage

Most importantly, make sure that you have recorded a lot of content that you can include in your videos. You can later get rid of any content that you don’t like. Though, if you don’t have the right footage, then you won’t be able to create your video in the first place.

#### Focus on one thing at a time

While traveling, you can get overwhelmed and might try to include a lot of things in a single video. Instead, try to focus on one central idea for the video. For instance, you can make a video on your visit to a local market or a historic site. If you want to include more, then make a video collage of the entire trip.
