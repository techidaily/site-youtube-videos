## Part 3: Benefits of Transcribing YouTube Videos

You may need video transcriptions for several reasons, such as analyzing the summary of the entire speech in the video, extracting a single phrase or quote that was spoken in the clip, or making the video helpful even for those suffering from hearing impairment. When you **transcribe a YouTube video**, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:

* **Search Engine Optimization**

When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.

* **Accent**

If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.

* **Repurposing on Blogs**

If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.

Therefore, the best way to get the job done accurately is, let YouTube auto-transcribe your video, download the transcription file, make the necessary changes to it, and then upload the file back to the video.

## Part 1: How to Transcribe YouTube Video Automatically for Free \[2 Ways\]

Besides the [basic video editing features on the YouTube](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) platform, you can now quickly **transcribe YouTube videos to the text** as well. The good thing is, you can either use the automatic transcription feature that YouTube offers, or upload it manually while adjusting the timing as you go further.

Below are the two methods to transcribe your YouTube videos for free:

### Method 1: Use the Automated Transcription Service on YouTube

As the name suggests, YouTube automatic transcription service works automatically. This means you don’t even have to click the ‘Transcribe’ button anymore to **transcribe a YouTube video**, and the website takes care of it on its own. All you need to do is, choose English as the language of the video when setting up subtitles. You can follow the instructions given below to do so:

#### Step 1  Upload a Video

Sign in to your YouTube account, click your profile picture from the top-right corner, and click **YouTube Studio** from the menu. Next, click **CREATE** from the upper-right corner, click **Upload videos** from the menu, and drag and drop a video from your computer to the **Upload videos** box that appears next.

![Upload YouTube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-upload-video.jpg)

#### Step 2  Select Transcription Language

On the **Details** page of the next box that appears, scroll down and click **MORE OPTIONS**, and select **English** in the **Video language** drop-down list under the **Language, subtitles, and closed captions (CC)** section.

![Select Language on YouTube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-language-on-youtube.jpg)

#### Step 3  Publish the Video

Follow the on-screen instructions from this point to publish the video, and wait while YouTube automatically transcribes and [adds the close captions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to it.

**Note:** Depending on the duration of the clip, the time YouTube would take to transcribe may vary.

After YouTube has transcribed the video, you can **download the transcription file** in your preferred format. The instructions are given below explain how you can do so:

1. **Get to the Subtitles Window**

While on the **YouTube Studio** page, click **Subtitles** from the left pane to go to the **Channel subtitles** page. And then click the video you want to modify.

1. **Get to Classic Studio**

In the video subtitle page of the target video, hover mouse on the **Published Automatic** status under the **Subtitles** column, click the **Options** icon (with three vertical dots) that appears, and click **Edit on Classic Studio**.

1. **Download Transcription File**

### Method 2: Get YouTube Transcription when Watching

In addition, if you are watching any other video, you can make YouTube transcribe that for you as well. You can follow the instructions given below to get the **YouTube video to text transcription**:

**Step 1: Play the Video**

Go to the video on YouTube and start playing it. Make sure NOT to get to full-screen mode as doing so would hide the option to transcribe the clip.

**Step 2: Enable Transcription**

Click the **More** icon (with three horizontal dots) from under the bottom-right corner of the video player, and click **Open transcript** to see the video transcription in the **Transcript** pane that appears in the right.

**Step 3: Manage Timestamps**

Click the **Options** icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner of the **Transcript** pane, and click **Toggle timestamp** to enable or disable the timestamps in the video transcription.

#### Limitations of Using YouTube Transcribe

Although YouTube’s automatic transcription is a decent feature that saves you a lot of time, since Google uses machine learning algorithms to convert the speech to text, the level of accuracy may vary depending on the accent of the speaker, and the clarity of the audio the video has. Also, even sometime you may not be satisfied with the end-results.

Alternatively, you can use Kapwing to **transcribe a YouTube video** and download the transcription file with the below step-by-step instructions:

## Part 3: Benefits of Transcribing YouTube Videos

You may need video transcriptions for several reasons, such as analyzing the summary of the entire speech in the video, extracting a single phrase or quote that was spoken in the clip, or making the video helpful even for those suffering from hearing impairment. When you **transcribe a YouTube video**, the transcript can be useful in many ways. Some of the most common benefits of transcribing a video include:

* **Search Engine Optimization**

When you add subtitles, the text can appear in Google search results when someone types a similar phrase in the search box. This helps get more views to your videos, thus giving your channel popularity, and you, monetary gains in the long run.

* **Accent**

If the speaker in the video is from a different region and is using an accent that you are not much comfortable with, you can turn on the subtitles and read the dialogs along with the video.

* **Repurposing on Blogs**

If you own a blog that you have embedded your video to, the transcription could be used to add text to it so the target audience can get a fair idea of what the video is all about. This is useful because many people prefer reading over watching.

### YouTube Video Transcription FAQs

#### 1. How to Transcribe YouTube Video to Text

Usually the transcription files have \*.srt extension that are globally accepted and supported by almost all media players. However, there might be instances when you want to have the subtitles in plain text.

* Right-click the **SRT** file
* Go to **Rename**
* Replace **srt** with **txt** and press **Enter**
* Click **OK** on the confirmation box that appears next to convert SRT to TXT

After this, you can simply double-click the file, and read and modify the transcribed content as needed.

#### 2. How to Edit and Upload Edited Transcript to YouTube

If you made any modifications to the transcript that was automatically generated by YouTube or any other third-party transcription tool, you can follow the steps given below to upload the new file to the YouTube video:

* Go to **YouTube Studio** and then to the **Channel subtitles** page as explained earlier
* Expand the **Languages** column of the target video
* Click the **Options** icon that appears under the **Subtitles** column when you hover mouse on to it
* Click **Edit on Classic Studio**
* On the next page, click **Edit** from the top-right corner

  * Click **Save Changes** from the top-right corner of the page when done

**Conclusion**

However, because these auto-generated transcriptions are created by machine learning algorithms, their accuracy cannot be counted on. Therefore, the best way to get the job done accurately is, let YouTube auto-transcribe your video, download the transcription file, make the necessary changes to it, and then upload the file back to the video.
