### Filmora- Why should you use it?

[**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a high-grade video editing software that allows users to create dynamic, eye-grabbing, and intuitive videos efficiently. You can use the features available in this Mac and Windows-based software to merge, cut, split, and more your video clips into one cohesive project. It is simple to add filters with pre-set FX plugins like Boris FX, among other available options, for a unique video look.

Additionally, you can adjust the coloring of your videos with Color Matching and Color Correction features and add titles/transitions, among others. You can add voiceover and audio effects and adjust the video's volume, tone, and soundtrack. AI-based features are also available here for quick automated edits (Instant Mode), removing background by focusing on only the subject (AI Portrait), and more.

## Final Words

Overall, Ryan Kaji saw great success with his stunning and engaging videos on his YouTube channel over the years. Also, he focused on other ventures, with the support of the team behind his channel, for income and editing work.

But, while starting, your funding will be less. It would help if you handled the video editing work on your own first, with reliable software like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Also, use other analytics tools and strategies to improve your channel further.
