## Part 3: How to Use AdSense for YouTube

### 1\. Finding Your Money in AdSense

Intuitively, many YouTube creators think that the first thing they see when they open up AdSense should be their daily earnings. This is not the case. Besides how much money you have made, AdSense keeps track of a lot of things the average YouTuber will not find useful. Getting to a report on your daily earnings actually takes a bit of navigation.

First, click on Performance Report near the top of your screen in AdSense. In the next page there will be a dropdown menu that says Days. Click on that menu and change it to Products.

In Products, scroll down until you get to a chart where there are two options: **Hosted AdSense for Content** and **AdSense for Content**. AdSense for Content relates to a personal website. For information about your YouTube channel click on **Hosted AdSense for Content**.

![adsense performance report](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-performance-report.JPG)

The next page is a report of how much money you have made from monetizing your YouTube channel. Your earnings will be organized by date. The money you see in this report has already had YouTube’s 45% commission deducted.

### 2\. How are my earnings determined?

How much money you make through AdSense depends on your [CPMs](https://www.marketingterms.com/dictionary/cpm/) and EPMs. CPM is an acronym for “cost per mille” and indicates how much money and advertiser is paying for 1000 impressions of an ad. RPM is your revenue per 1000 impressions.

A lot of YouTubers new to AdSense assume that “per thousand impressions” means “per thousand views”, and that is incorrect. Besides the fact that not all views are monetized, impressions are not views. They are ad clicks. For long, skippable, video ads an “impression” is when a viewer watches the ad to the end instead of skipping it.

CPMs vary depending on the type of ad, where it is being run, and current advertising trends. Advertisers pay more for certain kinds of ads or for ad space in more popular videos. Beware of MCN scams claiming they can guarantee you a certain CPM; they cannot. Which ads are displayed in your videos is determined automatically by YouTube’s system and depends on factors like how you categorized your videos and how many views they have.

### 3\. How do I get paid?

There are five different ways to get paid through AdSense: Check, Western Union Quick Cash, Wire Transfer, Rapida, or an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Generally, AdSense will begin the process of paying you your monthly earnings on the 21st of the following month. How long it takes to get your money after that depends on your payment method.

Using **Western Union Quick Cash** you can pick your cash up at your Western Union branch the same day.

**EFTs** get your money to you within seven business days after the 21st.

**Checks** can take two to four weeks to arrive in the mail.

**Wire Transfers** and **Rapida** can each take up to 15 days.

![adsense payment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adsense-payment.jpg)

In order to be paid you will have to earn enough to reach the payment threshold, which is $100\. So, if you only earn $5 in a month, you should not expect to receive a payment for that month. You will receive your first payment after you earn $100.

## Conclusion

Making money with YouTube Adsense is one of the best media that is reliable, easy to use, and better than any other ways of creating money. With Adsense, you can create various size and kinds of ad units to add it to your website. Those ad spaces are filled by Google with the content and traffic relevant to your site. There are also some YouTuber influencer marketing platforms such as [InflueNex](https://www.influenex.com/), which enables YouTubers to learn about their own channels, their competitors' channels, and join the platform for establishing replationship with the brands.

Aspiring comedians used to have to find success performing in bars and clubs before they’d get the chance to make big audiences laugh. Now funny people can reach millions of viewers on YouTube, and all they need are funny video ideas. [Generating great video ideas](https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html) isn't always easy, but I'm here to help you get over that minor speed bump.

Let's dive into the world of YouTube comedy videos and find out which ideas can help you launch your career as a comedian.

## 7 Comedy YouTube Video Ideas

1. [Do a Skit](#one)
2. [Start a Funny Series](#two)
3. [Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos](#three)
4. [Machinima and Gameplay Skits](#four)
5. [Parody Videos](#five)
6. [Bloopers](#six)
7. [Lip Sync Video](#seven)

#### 1\. Do a Skit

YouTube is the perfect medium for short, generally between one and ten minutes long comedy sketches. The majority of the audience on YouTube isn't patient enough to sit through a half-hour show, no matter how funny it is (at least not until you have a large fan base).

Your skit can be about literally anything, as long as it's short and effective. Having your own unique sense of humor is a crucial factor in ensuring the success of the sketches you post online.

#### 2\. Start a Funny Series

Try producing a pilot episode of a comedy series for your YouTube channel. Don't worry about the budget too much because if your ideas are good even a DIY approach will be enough.

Producing a funny series requires dedication and commitment to that goal, so don't let yourself be discouraged easily.

#### 3\. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos

Posting cute videos on your YouTube channel will certainly help you get attention online. The Internet loves videos of adorable babies, cats, dogs and other charming animals. Including these types of videos on your channel can be a good way to boost your subscriber count.

It is important to note that your content must be unique. Re-posting funny animal videos you find online won't get you far and will make it impossible to monetize your channel.

#### 4\. Machinima and Gameplay Skits

The term machinima means creating a cinematic production by re-using material from video games. Gameplay skits and machinima videos are a great way of reaching millions of gaming fans who enjoy good comedy videos.

The gaming industry is on the rise, and the audience that wants to watch video game-related content is growing every day. However, these types of videos require an in-depth knowledge of the gaming world, and you really have to know the games you draw from in order to make this idea work.

#### 5\. Parody Video

A well done, poignant parody never fails to make people laugh. Pop culture provides an endless source of TV shows, movies, and songs that can be used for your parody videos. When pop stars release big new music videos, they always get parodied by someone on YouTube within the first few days in order to capitalize on the trend while it’s fresh.

Parody videos will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and enable you to show the world that you are a talented, relevant comedian.

#### 6\. Bloopers

We all make mistakes. Blooper videos enable us to at least laugh at them. Experienced YouTubers know how easy it is to flub a take, but it takes a brave creator to make an entire video from the shots they messed up.

#### 7\. Lip-Sync Video

Have you ever imagined what it’s like to be a pop star? Lip-sync videos offer the opportunity to step into someone else's shoes for a moment and have fun with it. Knowing the song you’re lip-syncing and having good timing can help, but you can hardly go wrong producing a video of yourself pouring your soul into a song you're lip-syncing.

Lip-syncing to tunes from the most popular stars in the world will enable you to gain traffic from people looking for content related to those songs and artists.
