The best way to grow your channel is to focus on putting out quality content consistently. We do not recommend the following methods, but they do exist. Here are a couple of alternatives to purchasing views which are along those same lines (if you want to know how to grow organically without resorting to tactics like these, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/14-tactics-that-actually-work%21-how-to-gain-more-subscribers-300.html" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) When YouTube first started, getting views and subscribers was a lot easier. That’s not to say that creator didn’t have to work hard on their channels, just that they had a lot less competition.</p><p>YouTube has become so popular now that it is not uncommon for creators to look for alternative ways to stand out. Some might choose to buy views to kick start the organic growth of their channels (which is not a good idea), while others are looking for free ways of getting those views.</p><p>Two of these alternative methods are:</p><p><a href="#exchange"><strong>Part 1: Get More Views with View Exchange Platforms</strong></a></p><p><a href="#bots"><strong>Part 2: Get More YouTube Views with Bots</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-free-youtube-subs-banner.jpg"                      alt="Get free YouTube Subs"                ></a></p><h2 id="1-View-Exchange-Platforms"><a href="#1-View-Exchange-Platforms" class="headerlink" title="#1: View Exchange Platforms"></a>#1: View Exchange Platforms</h2><p>There are a variety of websites to choose from, but the main purpose is the same: you watch other people’s videos in order for them to watch your videos.</p><p>Here are the most popular view exchange platforms:</p><h4 id="1-View2be"><a href="#1-View2be" class="headerlink" title="1. View2be"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.view2.be/" >View2be <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view2be-free-youtube-views.jpg"                      alt="View Exchange Platforms - View2be"                ></p><p>View2be accounts are free. After you sign up, you will need to start watching videos from other YouTube publishers who are also members at View2be in order to earn coins. One of the differences between View2be and other view exchange platforms is that here, you can also complete some other tasks such as liking videos in order to earn more coins.</p><p>You can then spend the coins on views and likes for your own videos.</p><h4 id="2-GrowViews"><a href="#2-GrowViews" class="headerlink" title="2.

This is how the platform lists your YouTube videos.</p><p>After signing in, you just need to click on the Play button. The site’s player will work on the background, playing videos from other YouTube creators.</p><p>For each video that you watch, you will get 1 credit that you can then exchange for views on your own videos.</p><h4 id="3-YTMonster"><a href="#3-YTMonster" class="headerlink" title="3.

This will give you access to a dashboard where you can choose how to use the credits that you earn as well as keep track of what you have already spent credits on.</p><p>With YTMonster, you will be able to contact other video publishers like you and exchange not only views but comments, likes, and even subscriptions as well. You can even start campaigns to grow your YouTube channel as quickly as you can.</p><h4 id="4-KingdomLikes"><a href="#4-KingdomLikes" class="headerlink" title="4.

This platform isn’t only for YouTube views, it is for the exchange of social actions across multiple websites. One of the main advantages of using the KingdomLikes is that you can also use this same platform to get likes or views on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, as well as on YouTube.</p><p>Just like with the other platforms, you will need to watch other people’s videos in order to earn views for yourself.</p><h4 id="5-AddVisits"><a href="#5-AddVisits" class="headerlink" title="5.

Once your video is approved, you define how many points you are willing to give to people who watch your videos or like them. In exchange, you watch other people’s videos and get points as compensation. You can then exchange those points for more views or likes.</p><h2 id="2-Get-More-Views-with-YouTube-View-Bots"><a href="#2-Get-More-Views-with-YouTube-View-Bots" class="headerlink" title="#2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots"></a>#2: Get More Views with YouTube View Bots</h2><p>When most people think about getting free views on YouTube, they immediately think about bots.</p><p>Bots can be dangerous for your channel. The wrong bot can really hurt your search rankings and if you get caught using bots you can lose your account.</p><p>If you are going to try a bot, make sure you choose one that offers high retention views (most can’t, but may say they can). High retention views mean YouTube interprets the data as someone watching your video for a period of time, vs just clicking on it and then leaving the page. A bot that can’t offer high retention views just ends up making it look like a lot of people clicked on your video, but none of them liked it enough to watch. That will cause YouTube to rank your video very low in its search results.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-make-better-youtube-videos--278.html" >Making great content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and polishing up your <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/4-steps-to-rank-higher-in-youtube%E2%80%99s-search-results-277.html" >YouTube SEO skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will help you grow your channel over time, and this is probably the best way to go. However, you have a lot of options for how to get free views on YouTube if you want to try to kick start that growth. Besides, using a good video editing software is also important. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular

The scientific explanations of ASMR and the list of its potential causes of this reaction are not as extensive as they can be.</p><p>Moreover, the visual and audio content that is designed to trigger the ASMR is perceived as unusual which further contributes to the controversy associated with this genre of videos. You are at the right place if you would like to learn more about ASMR because in this article we are going to take you through all the things you need to know about ASMR.</p><h2 id="How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work"><a href="#How-Do-ASMR-Videos-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do ASMR Videos Work?"></a>How Do ASMR Videos Work?</h2><p>As strange as it may sound, millions of people around the globe are watching videos of someone whispering into a microphone, and apparently, it is helping them deal with stress, anxiety, and insomnia.</p><p>However, watching a video in any setting isn’t enough to trigger ASMR. You have to be in a quiet room and away from the everyday hustle in order to put yourself into the state of mind in which experiencing ASMR is possible. So, once you’ve found a comfortable position in a quiet room you can play an ASMR video.</p><p>The type of trigger the video’s host is going to use varies from one video to another because in one video they might just speak softly into a microphone or gently blow air into it, while in another they might produce sounds using plastic or metal objects.</p><p>Moreover, the ASMR triggers the video’s host is going to use also depend on the host because some hosts are predominantly focused on audio triggers, while others focus on visual ASMR triggers. Role-plays are also quite common for ASMR videos and you can easily end up seeing the hosts dressed up as librarians, doctors, or even tailors pretending to measure your dimensions.</p><p>As a form of synesthesia, ASMR is triggered by a role-play or a low speaking voice as the visual or audio stimuli is associated with a pleasant experience that originates from the top of the head and then spreads through the neck and back.</p><p>Ideally, such a video should get you in the state of calmness and slight euphoria which in turn should help you relax and relieve the stress you’re experiencing. Whether or not ASMR videos can achieve this goal is debatable.</p><h2 id="Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone"><a href="#Can-ASMR-Be-Experienced-by-Anyone" class="headerlink" title="Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?"></a>Can ASMR Be Experienced by Anyone?</h2><p>The short and simple answer is no. In fact, most people are not ASMR sensitive and they don’t experience a tingling sensation when they hear someone whispering or see some of the common visual triggers of ASMR.</p><p>In addition, those who are capable of experiencing AMSR cannot initiate the sensation with just any of the known triggers. In most cases, ASMR is triggered by a particular sound or a visual stimulus that helps the person relax and feel the pleasurable sensation spread through their body.</p><p>Most ASMR videos are long so that the viewer can take their time to unwind before falling asleep. Whether or not the ASMR video will achieve the desired effect largely depends on the person watching it, because the AMSR trigger the video features may not affect the viewer who is sensitive to different types of stimuli.</p><h2 id="The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers"><a href="#The-Most-Common-ASMR-Triggers" class="headerlink" title="The Most Common ASMR Triggers"></a>The Most Common ASMR Triggers</h2><p>It is still unclear what can trigger an ASMR since scientific research in this field has been scarce. Hence, it is difficult to know exactly what and under which circumstances can initiate such a reaction.</p><p>However, this phenomenon can be triggered by the following stimuli:</p><h3 id="1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice"><a href="#1-Whispering-or-a-Low-Soft-Voice" class="headerlink" title="1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice"></a>1. Whispering or a Low Soft Voice</h3><p>This is by far the most common ASMR trigger. Speaking in a low soft voice will likely create a tingling and pleasant sensation that will ultimately relax the listener. Consequently, the vast majority of ASMR video hosts are whispering or speaking softly into the microphone.</p><h3 id="2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks"><a href="#2-Hearing-repetitive-sounds-created-by-the-performance-of-mundane-tasks" class="headerlink" title="2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks"></a>2. Hearing repetitive sounds created by the performance of mundane tasks</h3><p>The sounds created while turning the pages of a book, crumpling a piece of paper, or typing on a mechanical keyboard can all be potential ASMR triggers. It seems that the pleasant sensation is associated with the repetitiveness of these sounds, as they create a calming atmosphere.</p><h3 id="3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task"><a href="#3-Watching-someone-perform-an-everyday-task" class="headerlink" title="3. Watching someone perform an everyday task"></a>3. Watching someone perform an everyday task</h3><p>Seeing someone draw, paint, chop up food, or even write on a piece of paper can trigger the ASMR. Some people find the visual aspect of these actions relaxing, which in turn helps them get rid of the stress and sleep better.</p><h3 id="4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking"><a href="#4-Sounds-generated-while-a-person-is-eating-or-drinking" class="headerlink" title="4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking"></a>4. Sounds generated while a person is eating or drinking</h3><p>Chewing food loudly or slurping can generate a tingling sensation at the top of your head that later spreads through the entire body.</p><h3 id="5-Getting-attention"><a href="#5-Getting-attention" class="headerlink" title="5. Getting attention"></a>5. Getting attention</h3><p>Although almost everyone likes receiving attention, some people have a strong ASMR reaction to being the center of someone’s attention.</p><h3 id="6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors"><a href="#6-Triggering-the-ASMR-without-the-use-of-external-factors" class="headerlink" title="6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors"></a>6. Triggering the ASMR without the use of external factors</h3><p>Some people have the ability to trigger ASMR consciously without having to resort to audio or visual stimuli. However, this is quite rare as most members of the ASMR community rely on video and audio content to trigger the ASMR.</p><h3 id="7-Tapping-on-a-surface"><a href="#7-Tapping-on-a-surface" class="headerlink" title="7.

Listening to someone exhale into a mic"></a>10. Listening to someone exhale into a mic</h3><p>This ASMR trigger is frequently used in ASMR videos. Like all other audio ASMR triggers, blowing air into a microphone can help a person relax and fall asleep.</p><h2 id="What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular"><a href="#What-Makes-ASMR-Videos-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?"></a>What Makes ASMR Videos So Popular?</h2><p>A little over a year ago there were more than 13 million ASMR videos on YouTube, which shows vividly how popular this genre of video has become. Moreover, the videos containing hosts and animals eating different types of food have amassed billions of views.</p><p>The stressful lives we all lead, boredom, or simply the need to experience something different are the most common reasons why people watch ASMR videos. In addition, the viewers of these videos suggest that they help them deal with depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems. Over the course of the last decade, the ASMR videos have risen from obscurity to become one of the most popular genres of YouTube videos largely due to their uniqueness and their relaxing nature.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos"><a href="#Where-to-Find-ASMR-videos" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find ASMR videos?"></a>Where to Find ASMR videos?</h2><p>A simple google search will reveal a variety of ASMR videos, since all major video hosting platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitch, or Vimeo offer a broad selection of ASMR videos. Their contents vary from simple videos of hosts whispering into a microphone to carefully planned and staged role plays. Also, you try installing the app called Tingles on your Smartphone if you want to have access to a huge collection of ASMR triggers.</p><p>Moreover, ASMR videos can be found on websites that host pornographic content, which is the consequence of the sexualization of this phenomenon. Therefore where to look for ASMR videos depends on the type of ASMR content you’re looking for. One thing is certain, you won’t have much trouble finding ASMR videos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>At the beginning of the decade, ASMR was a little known phenomenon very few people knew about. Today, ASMR videos attract huge audiences from all around the world, as they’ve become one of the most popular types of videos on YouTube and other video hosting platforms.</p><p>Despite the enormous popularity of ASMR content, we still have much to learn about the phenomenon itself and what triggers it. The little information that is available indicates that not everyone is capable of having an autonomous sensory meridian response to audio or visual stimuli. Furthermore, the potential triggers vary from whispering to watching someone prepare food, which contributes to the mystery surrounding the phenomenon.</p><p>Hopefully, this article has helped you develop a better understanding of ASMR.

Here, you will also learn how to resolve the problem if it occurs on your smartphone.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-for-YouTubers-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-for-YouTubers-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor for YouTubers: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best Video Editor for YouTubers: Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Filmora is one of the most popular video editing software among YouTubers, whether you’re creating gameplay, education, travel videos, or other types of videos, you will find Filmora perfectly meets your needs.

If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a <strong>YouTube TV black screen</strong>.</p><p><strong>Incompatible Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.</p><p><strong>Slow Internet Connection</strong></p><p>This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.</p><p><strong>Stale DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.</p><p><strong>Outdated Display Driver</strong></p><p>As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health. If an updated version of the display driver is not installed on your Windows computer, you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]"></a>Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]</h2><p>Depending on the root cause of the issue, the solutions to fix the <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong> issue may differ. Nevertheless, some of the most effective remedies are discussed below in detail:</p><h3 id="1-Web-Browser-Solution-s"><a href="#1-Web-Browser-Solution-s" class="headerlink" title="1. Web Browser Solution(s)"></a>1. Web Browser Solution(s)</h3><p><strong>Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>When you experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome, click the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> icon from the top-right corner, and then select <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser</strong></p><p>If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use a Different Browser</strong></p><p>If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press <strong>Enter</strong> and see if the video plays correctly.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser</strong></p><p>Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:</p><p>After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, and then go to <strong>More tools</strong>, and then select <strong>Clear browsing data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome cache"                ></p><p>Switch between the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> tabs on the <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the <strong>Time range</strong> drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome browsing data"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Clear data</strong> from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Disable&#x2F;Remove the Extensions</strong></p><p>If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome and go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, go to <strong>More tools,</strong> then select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the submenu that appears.</p><p>Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg"                      alt="disable google chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click <strong>Remove</strong> to get rid of it altogether.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser</strong></p><p>If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:</p><p>• Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the results list.</p><p>• On the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> from under the <strong>Programs</strong></p><p>• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from above the list.</p><p>• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC. Next, use Microsoft Edge (or any other browser) to download and install a fresh copy of Google Chrome and see if the issue is fixed</p><h3 id="2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s"><a href="#2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s" class="headerlink" title="2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)"></a>2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)</h3><p>If you are experiencing a slow Internet connection, the issue might be either from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side, or on your part. In any case, you can try the following solutions to fix the issue:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Get Your PC&#x2F;Laptop Closer to the Router</strong></p><p>If you are using a Wi-Fi network, consider bringing your device a bit closer to the wireless router and see if the issue is fixed. You may also want to recheck and ensure that there are no highly magnetic devices (a speaker or something similar) placed near the router.</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Switch to a Wired Network</strong></p><p>If the problem persists, try connecting your laptop&#x2F;desktop PC to your router with a LAN cable, and then try reopening the YouTube video to see if it plays correctly this time.</p><p><strong>PC&#x2F;Windows Solution(s)</strong></p><p>At times, your computer could be the main culprit, and trying some basic troubleshooting steps might resolve the issue. Some of the most effective solutions are listed below:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Clearing the DNS cache ensures that your PC is now ready to accept and save new DNS records in the cache. The process of clearing the existing cache data is listed below:</p><p>Type <strong>CMD</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and click <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the right menu of the results list.</p><p>Click <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>User Account Control</strong> confirmation box, and in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window, type <strong>IPCONFIG &#x2F;FLUSHDNS</strong> and press Enter</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-command-to-fix-youtube-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="use command to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Try opening the YouTube video again and see if the issue is fixed</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Update the Graphic Card Driver</strong></p><p>Anything that you see on your computer screen is because of the graphics card. Since a driver is needed to interact with the device, an old one might prevent the videos from getting displayed. If the graphics card is the culprit, the chances are that you won’t be able to see any video at all, be it from YouTube or offline. Therefore, checking if you are using the latest version of the graphic card driver wouldn’t harm you. The process is given below:</p><p>Right-click <strong>Start</strong> and go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the context menu</p><p>Expand the <strong>Display adapters</strong> tree on the <strong>Device Manager</strong> snap-in, and right-click the graphics card from the list and select <strong>Update driver</strong> from the context menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upgrade-graphic-card-to-fix-youtube-video-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="upgrade graphic card to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Search automatically for drivers</strong> from the next screen that appears and follow the on-screen instructions from there to update the graphic card driver.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If your PC has multiple graphic cards installed in it, you will have to follow this procedure for each of them individually.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?"></a>Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?</h2><p>If you wish to watch online videos on your smartphone, but experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, the process of fixing the issue on the phones is comparatively simple.

It’s not as simple as the number of clicks your video gets. If someone sits and refreshes your video over and over without letting it play for any significant time, those refreshes won’t be recorded as views.

Here we recommend using Filmora to easily edit YouTube videos.</p><p>You can use Filmora to make YouTube videos with built-in royalty-free audio. Filmora also can help you make YouTube intros.

Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count"></a>1. Not Everyone Who Clicks Adds to Your View Count</h2><p>YouTube doesn’t provide a clear definition of what counts as a view, but we know that someone clicks on your video, and clicking right away doesn’t count. That’s how we know that watch time is a factor. Some studies conclude that a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/library/social-video-metrics/#9" >full 30 seconds need to be viewed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to register as one view, but there is no way to know for sure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-count-view.JPG"                      alt="how YouTube counts view"                ></p><h2 id="2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views"><a href="#2-How-Does-YouTube-Count-Views" class="headerlink" title="2. How Does YouTube Count Views?"></a>2. How Does YouTube Count Views?</h2><p>YouTube wants to be sure that views are coming from humans and not bots. So, during the first couple of hours after you publish a video, YouTube seems to be stricter about what they count. The views which are counted are the ones that YouTube believes to be legitimate. Sometimes, it ends up skipping legitimate views for the sake of discretion.</p><p>Once this window of time passes, it is likely that you will see the view counter start to update a lot more frequently. The counter could still revert to updating slower and more hesitantly, though, if YouTube’s algorithm thinks it’s detecting something fishy.</p><p>At times, your view count can even be frozen temporarily until the algorithm can validate the views you are receiving. This is done to ensure a fair and positive experience for everyone who creates content. View counts can be adjusted by the algorithm in either direction.</p><p>You May Also Like:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" > 5 Tips To Get More Views With YouTube Optimization [Free Checklist] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work"><a href="#3-How-Does-YouTube’s-View-Count-Algorithm-Work" class="headerlink" title="3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?"></a>3. How Does YouTube’s View Count Algorithm Work?</h2><p>Termed by many as one of the most boggling algorithms of all time, it is really hard to decode the complete dynamics of the YouTube view count algorithm.</p><p>There are some tests you can run yourself to try to unpack it.</p><p>If you upload a video and then <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >set it as unlisted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t get any public views so you can experiment by doing things like watching for different lengths of time and seeing what gets counted.</p><p>You’ll have to use a computer in a different location and make sure the account is not the same as the one you used to upload the video. Now, you need to watch the video for roughly 15 seconds. The key here is to keep it less than 30 seconds. You will see that the view did not add to the count. If you repeat this process on multiple computers at varying locations and with different accounts and you are likely to find the same result.</p><p>However, if you watch it for 30 seconds or longer it is likely that the count will go up.</p><p>We are adding ‘likely’ here because, despite this 30-second rule which has been decoded, there are other factors that might contribute to whether a view is counted as well as other automated scanning techniques at play.</p><p>Try to watch the same video numerous times in a single day. You will find that the count will add up at first, but after some time it will stop. YouTube knows that a lot of times people replay some videos over and over when they really enjoy them, and so they want to factor replays into their algorithm because they suggest quality. However, to avoid spam views, the counter will stop after a certain point.</p><h2 id="4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count"><a href="#4-Account-Tracking-Factors-Some-Viewers-Don’t-Count" class="headerlink" title="4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count"></a>4. Account Tracking Factors - Some Viewers Don’t Count</h2><p>Something else that can affect whether a view is counted is the behavior of the account which watches it prior to landing on your video’s watch page. Sometimes, YouTube might feel that there is an increased chance a particular account is actually a bot, and then views from that account might not be added.</p><p>One way that <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/27792330?hl=en" >YouTube might flag an account as a potential bot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is if it is jumping between videos directly without navigating through recommendations, the search engine, or the account’s subscriber feed (how are they getting between these watch page URLs if they aren’t clicking on anything YouTube can record?). To add to it, if the viewer is watching each of the videos for almost 30 seconds exactly (or less) there is an increased probability that it is not a human but a bot (or a human watching the bare minimum as part of a view exchange program).</p><p>Any bot-like action will result in an account’s views do not be added to your view count.</p><h2 id="5-The-Skip-Skim"><a href="#5-The-Skip-Skim" class="headerlink" title="5. The Skip &amp; Skim"></a>5. The Skip &amp; Skim</h2><p>It’s not uncommon for viewers to watch a video for say five seconds, skip forwards a bit and watch for another ten seconds as they look for a specific part. It is hard to say whether skipping through a video, but watching a scattered 30 seconds, would count as a view or not.</p><h2 id="6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts"><a href="#6-Frozen-YouTube-View-Counts" class="headerlink" title="6. Frozen YouTube View Counts"></a>6. Frozen YouTube View Counts</h2><p>Sometimes YouTube will freeze a view count in order to check that it is accurate. When the count is unfrozen, the count may jump up as views are validated or it can go down if YouTube detects a problem.</p><p>You can use <a class="link"   href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/youtube-analytics/" >YouTube’s analytics reports <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to monitor an estimate of your potential views, but there is no assurance that this data will completely match your official view count.</p><h2 id="7-The-301-Mark"><a href="#7-The-301-Mark" class="headerlink" title="7. The 301 Mark"></a>7. The 301 Mark</h2><p>You may have seen a lot of videos that have a stagnant count of 301 views. The algorithm behind YouTube’s view counting system believes that any video which has fetched higher than 300 views has the ability to impact people’s perception of quality on YouTube. They do not want the homepage to be crowded with artificially popular videos.</p><p>This is why view counts are often frozen at 301. The employees at YouTube then manually verify whether the views obtained so far are legitimate or fake. Once the employees are sure that the views are legit, the counter is unfrozen and you will see an upward swing.</p><p>During the period when the view count is frozen every legitimate view is still counted, just not added immediately. Once the YouTube team is sure that your videos are not getting fake traffic, your view count will be updated to include views that were registered during the frozen phase. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100759/youtube-301-view-count-freeze-going-away" >YouTube says <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it won’t flag videos at 301 views anymore.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In short, we know YouTube expects a viewer to watch a video for around 30 seconds before it counts a view, that views from suspicious accounts are not counted, and that YouTube can decide to freeze your view count while they review your views. They are protecting the site from becoming saturated with videos that only look popular because of bots. Ultimately, ‘how does YouTube count views’ isn’t a question anyone but YouTube can answer for sure, but we do know it isn’t as simple as ‘a view is someone clicking on your video’.</p><p>If you want to engage your audience with cool effects and Filmora is the best choice to make a split-screen and green screen video for YouTubers.

They are no rocket science, but only a tad bit more than what you know as a bookmarking feature.</p><p>Think of highlighted comments as a “tag”. You might notice this in the form of a ‘new activity YouTube notification’ link you receive on your registered email. Only you can see this tag when you click the notification and arrive at Youtube.com to either view or reply to a comment.</p><p>Highlighting comments (HC’s) are an automatic feature generated by YouTube. It draws the YouTuber’s &amp; viewer’s attention to relevant activities. Don’t fail to notice that the highlight disappears once you are done interacting in the tagged comment thread. However, they are reloadable by tapping the comment timestamp.</p><p>For instance, you may want to check the following links.

These comments appear even above the pinned comments on a video. The label of a highlighted comment is displayed above the commentator’s name in a light grey shade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>YouTube labels comment replies as well and call it “Highlighted Reply.” You can see this tag above the replier’s name in the same color tone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-reply.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Reply"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-My-Comment-Highlighted" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?"></a>Part 3: How to Make My Comment Highlighted?</h2><p>Now, making YouTube highlight your comment on a popular video is nothing less than an art. YouTube doesn’t make it easy for you. The advantage of getting your comment highlighted on YouTube is limitless.</p><p>Thus, anybody who wants to get their YouTube comment an HC tag has to follow a few simple steps, which we will discuss below in another section. Finding the correct or relevant video content that can benefit your channel from such a comment is an excellent place to start.</p><p>For example, if you are a YouTuber who deals in tech information, you need to look for a popular video or channel with a similar genre, in this case, technical knowledge. The more popular the channel is, the more is the chance of a viewer checking the comments on its videos. You will only benefit if you’re comment is highlighted on pages of Youtuber’s who are huge.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-URL-of-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the URL of Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>The ways to acquire the URL or link for a highlighted comment are different for both parties- viewer and host.</p><p>Suppose you are a viewer who is going through the comments section of a video. If you want to get the highlighted URL for the comment, simply click on the timestamp (e.g., 2 weeks ago) beside the commentator’s username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-highlighted-comments.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Highlighted Comments"                ></p><p>On the other hand, for a YouTuber, getting access to the comment URL is relatively straightforward.

If you want to follow up or reply to such comments, you can do so from your email or YouTube Dashboard.</p><p>If you click the notification bell icon, whenever a viewer drops a new comment on one of your videos, YouTube will send you a notification via email. On opening the email, you will find a clickable “Reply” option. Or else, if you follow the comment section in the YouTube Dashboard, you can directly view or reply to highlighted comments from here as well.</p><p>Have you ever wondered why a highlighted comment always shows at the top of the comment list? Both the above options will lead you to the comment thread on YouTube. To help you find the new activity easily, it appears with the highlight tag on it. The purpose is to remind you that you are here for that specific comment.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Remove-Highlighted-Comments" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?"></a>Part 6: How to Remove Highlighted Comments?</h2><p>Can you, as a video maker, remove highlighted comments on YouTube? The direct answer to this would be a ‘No.’ It is because based on how you have opened the specific video, YouTube does it automatically.</p><p>Alternatively, you can try out a few temporary solutions.</p><ol><li>You can edit the particular URL of the video where the highlighted tag is showing. Remove the red part of the URL (example given below) starting with “&amp;”:</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA&amp;lc=Ugya-89WYAlutJurKGh4AaABAg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> After removing the above parameter, reload the original video link (below):</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWhjJjhpmQA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ol><li>Try logging out from your Google Account and browse YouTube (anonymously). Doing this will ensure that you no longer see any highlighted comments. However, at the same time, this will restrict you from interacting in any way with that video, let alone leaving a comment.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment"><a href="#Part-7-Tips-for-Writing-a-Comment-that-will-be-Pinned-as-a-Highlighted-Comment" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?"></a>Part 7: Tips for Writing a Comment that will be Pinned as a Highlighted Comment?</h2><p>Many frequently inquire on the internet about how they can improve the chances of getting their comment pinned, as highlighted on YouTube. The secret lies in how you write the statement. We’ve listed a few pro tips below that can help:</p><ul><li>First, go through all the posted comments under the video. It will help you identify what is missing. You can comment or write the missing point in comprehendible and straightforward words. Also, never forget to acknowledge the YouTuber’s talent.</li><li>Remember, no one has the time to read long comments. So, when you know what you want to write, try to shorten your sentences. A short and crisp comment draws more attention.</li><li>After you have framed your comment, make sure that it is grammatically correct. YouTube and Google hate grammatical errors.</li><li>Do not hit the post option already. Before publishing it, you must cross-check that your comment has all the above points in place.</li><li>Lastly, you have to wait after publishing on the video’s comment section. YouTube will highlight your comment if it passes according to the YouTube policy and if the search engine finds it unique.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial"><a href="#Part-8-Are-Highlighted-Comments-Beneficial" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?"></a>Part 8: Are Highlighted Comments Beneficial?</h2><p>Being a convenience feature, a highlighted comment on YouTube is 100% beneficial. That is especially true if you are looking for ways to optimize your channel.</p><p>YouTube is undeniably the second largest search engine on the web. Highlight comments can potentially increase the outreach of your content and, consequently, your brand presence.</p><p>As said earlier, these comments always show first on the comment section. Needless to say, many people who watch the videos also scroll down to the comments section to start a conversation or see what other viewers are saying about this video.</p><p>In the process, alongside the interaction, they also check out the channels or profiles of the commentators. Viewers often visit the pages of these channels, and if they happen to enjoy the video content, they will subscribe to the YouTuber’s channel. If your comment gets highlighted, your YouTube channel can be one of them.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>YouTube can be an intimidating tool for marketing and more so for newcomers. Every YouTuber wishes that their channel performs better than the previous day. Even though the highlighted comment or highlighted reply feature doesn’t have any direct benefits, it can indeed help in optimizing your YouTube channel.</p><p>It can connect you with potential viewers and increase the number of people that visit your channel regularly. However, how many of them stay and hit the “Subscribe” button is a different story altogether and is wholly based on whether they like what you share through your videos.</p><p>In this article, we have shared facts on YouTube’s commonly seen highlighted comment feature. Yet, the term is a heavily misleading one, as far as viewers and Youtuber’s are concerned. We have also covered all other aspects and queries related to this term. Here’s hoping they clarify all your doubts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-video-from-youtube-to-dailymotion/"><u>How to Transfer Video From YouTube to Dailymotion?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-youtube-popularity-editing-and-optimizing-content-metadata/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing YouTube Popularity  Editing & Optimizing Content Metadata</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/calculating-riches-a-look-at-mr-beasts-wallet/"><u>Calculating Riches  A Look at Mr. Beast's Wallet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhancing-video-reach-convert-yt-to-igtv/"><u>2024 Approved  Enhancing Video Reach  Convert YT to IGTV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-top-link-minimizers-transforming-youtube-watchability/"><u>In 2024, 5-Top Link Minimizers Transforming YouTube Watchability</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-audio-dialogue-recorder/"><u>[New] Audio Dialogue Recorder</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-amplify-your-audience-maximizing-youtube-viewership/"><u>[Updated] Amplify Your Audience  Maximizing YouTube Viewership</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/transferring-tv-episodes-downloading-youtube-content-ios-style/"><u>Transferring TV Episodes  Downloading YouTube Content iOS-Style</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/from-xml-to-srt-a-step-by-step-solution-approach-for-2024/"><u>From XML to SRT  A Step-by-Step Solution Approach for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-hard-reset-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-phone-using-pc-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>3 Solutions to Hard Reset Samsung Galaxy A14 5G Phone Using PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/top-5-sony-xperia-10-v-bypass-frp-tools-for-pc-that-actually-work-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 5 Sony Xperia 10 V Bypass FRP Tools for PC That Actually Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-revisit-the-past-easy-access-to-fb-story-archive/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Revisit the Past  Easy Access to FB Story Archive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revolutionizing-work-with-windows-10-innovations/"><u>2024 Approved  Revolutionizing Work with Windows 10 Innovations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-three-ways-to-sim-unlock-motorola-edge-40-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Three Ways to Sim Unlock Motorola Edge 40 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/does-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-support-mkv-video-files-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-mkv-on-android/"><u>Does Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra support MKV video files?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-the-error-of-unfortunately-the-processcomandroidphone-has-stopped-on-realme-c51-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix the Error of Unfortunately the Process.com.android.phone Has Stopped on Realme C51 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-s-leading-lego-stop-motion-studios-and-filmmakers/"><u>New S Leading Lego Stop Motion Studios and Filmmakers</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

When you’re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels. In this article, we’ll be going over the top nine resources online for making YouTube logos for free.</p><ol><li><a href="#pixlr">PIXLR EDITOR</a></li><li><a href="#getpaint">GETPAINT</a></li><li><a href="#canva">CANVA</a></li><li><a href="#designevo">DESIGNEVO</a></li><li><a href="#logomakr">LOGOMAKR</a></li><li><a href="#fotor">FOTOR</a></li><li><a href="#snappa">SNAPPA</a></li><li><a href="#logaster">LOGASTER</a></li><li><a href="#cooltext">COOLTEXT</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-PIXLR-EDITOR-3"><a href="#1-PIXLR-EDITOR-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Not only the interface is simple and intuitive, it has both the basic and professional editing tools such as cutting, trimming, crop&amp;zoom, a large collection of video effects and royalty-free music, and you can also upload the video directly on YouTube after editing.

If a viewer watches more than 30 seconds of the ad or clicks it, then the YouTuber will make money.</p><p>This is a general estimate of how much a YouTuber can make from ads once they qualify:</p><p>- 68% of advertisers ad spend goes to the video creator. If advertisers spend $100, creators get $68.</p><p>- $0.18 is the average rate per ad view.</p><p>- 1000 ad views will equal approximately $18</p><p>- 1000 video views will equal between $2-$5</p><h2 id="Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads"><a href="#Why-It’s-So-Hard-for-YouTubers-to-Make-Money-From-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads"></a><strong>Why It’s So Hard for YouTubers to Make Money From Ads</strong></h2><p>For new YouTubers, it is getting harder and harder to get to that point where their sole income can be from YouTube ads. Before they can make a penny, they must first qualify.</p><h4 id="Monetization-Rules-as-of-January-2018"><a href="#Monetization-Rules-as-of-January-2018" class="headerlink" title="Monetization Rules (as of January 2018):"></a><strong>Monetization Rules (</strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/youtube-tightens-rukles/"><strong>as of January 2018</strong></a><strong>):</strong></h4><p>- Creators need 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of view time in 12 months before they can turn on monetization</p><p>- YouTube pays in $100 increments</p><p> Once they have monetization turned on, it’s only the beginning. YouTubers need to create good content consistently. In order to earn $100 for the initial payout, they need an average of 50,000 views. That’s just $100! A lot of views and not a big payout. Hardly enough to quit your day job.</p><p>That is why it is essential to have alternative ways to make money on YouTube, and not rely on the ads shown on your videos. So, without further ado, here are 4 other ways to make money on YouTube:</p><h2 id="1-Sell-Your-Product-or-Service"><a href="#1-Sell-Your-Product-or-Service" class="headerlink" title="1. Sell Your Product or Service:"></a><strong>1. Sell Your Product or Service:</strong></h2><p>YouTube is one of the most effective means of marketing and selling your products and services if you are able to use it effectively and drive people to click and buy.</p><p>Here are some examples of products and services you can offer:</p><h4 id="Products"><a href="#Products" class="headerlink" title="Products:"></a><strong>Products:</strong></h4><p>- eBooks</p><p>- Artwork</p><p>- Licensed content</p><p>- Online course</p><p>- Channel&#x2F;brand merchandise</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jack-paul1.jpg"                      alt="YouTuber Jake Paul "                ></p><p><em>YouTuber, Jake Paul uses eCommerce platform</em> <a href="https://fanjoy.co/collections/"><em>Fanjoy</em></a><em>to sell his merch.</em></p><h4 id="Services"><a href="#Services" class="headerlink" title="Services:"></a><strong>Services:</strong></h4><p>- Consulting work (strategy planner, financial advisor, etc.)</p><p>- Contracting work (designer, developer, etc.)</p><p>- Education (tutor, trainer, etc.)</p><p>- Performance&#x2F;Speaking Opportunities (motivational speaker, musician, etc.)</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sunny-lenarduzzi2.jpg"                      alt="YouTuber Sunny Lenarduzzi"                ></p><p><em>YouTuber and entrepreneur, Sunny Lenarduzzi uses YouTube as a platform to get clients for her consulting business.</em></p><h4 id="How-to-Sell-a-Product-or-Service-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Sell-a-Product-or-Service-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Sell a Product or Service on YouTube"></a><strong>How to Sell a Product or Service on YouTube</strong></h4><p>YouTube is a vast platform and if you don’t have a clear direction for what you are selling, you might be making videos for an audience that isn’t interested in buying what you are selling.</p><p>Here is how you should go about selling your product or service on YouTube:</p><p> <strong>1. Your content must be discovered by the right people:</strong> If the wrong people find your content, then you aren’t going to make any sales. To get the right eyes on your videos, you’ll need to do some research on your target audience and what keywords they use when searching for your product or services.</p><p>If you are selling a meditation eBook and guided meditation services, type in some possible keywords in the YouTube search bar. What appears will be some popular searches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/meditation3.png"                      alt="meditation"                ></p><p>From there, take your possible keywords and put them into a tool such as <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to find other related keywords. This will help you create discoverable content that will catch the interest of those who will buy what you are selling.</p><p> <strong>2. Your content must have value:</strong> You cannot start with the Call to Action or try selling to your audience right away. You must first build trust and prove that what you are selling has value.</p><p>Take this example from <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ModernHealthMonk" >Modern Health Monk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a weight loss coach.</p><p>  In the video, he offers tips on how journaling can help the viewer reach their goal. The way he intends to make money is through people signing up for his course. The course is the product he is selling, but he doesn’t say that. He knows the viewers are not there to enroll in a course. They are there to learn about what he is offering.</p><p>The video is over 9 minutes long and not once does he tell his audience to buy anything. However, he does encourage the viewer at the end to download a free eBook. Selling is about focusing on the long game.</p><p> <strong>3. Your content must lead the audience to a place where they can buy:</strong> You don’t want to force people through a door, but you do want the signs to be visible. You will need to direct the viewer to a place where they can make the purchase. YouTube has a few ways to point your viewers in that direction.</p><p><strong>Link in the description box:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/link-in-description-box4.jpg"                      alt="link in the description box"                ></p><p><strong>The YouTube Card:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-tutorial5.jpg"                      alt="youtube card tutorial"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-card-details6.jpg"                      alt="youtube card details"                ></p><p>You can add one or multiple cards to direct viewers to your website or to another related video.</p><p> <strong>Call to action button:</strong></p><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-to-action-button7.jpg"                      alt="call to action button"                ></strong></p><p>Once the viewer is on your website, make sure the path is apparent as well.

Her YouTube channel gave her an audience and proved to publishers that there was enough demand for her to write a book that people will read.</p><p> As you <a class="link"   href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/get-more-youtube-subscribers-increase-video-views/" >grow your audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will find that there will be a demand for certain products or services that don’t already exist. This is where you put on your entrepreneur hat and think of something that your audience will pay money for and make it happen. Odds are, when it happens, it wouldn’t even be a mystery, your audience will tell you to make or supply it.</p><p>For example, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uke6eXzgjQQ" >Remi Cruz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a YouTuber with over 2.2 million subscribers. Remi created a beauty brand and DIY face mask, <a class="link"   href="https://shophoneypop.com/" >Honey Pop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which could only have happened after taking the time to understand her supportive audience.</p><h2 id="2-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#2-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="2. Affiliate Marketing:"></a><strong>2. Affiliate Marketing:</strong></h2><p>Businesses know that there are more eyes watching YouTube than ever — behind Google, YouTube is the second most popular place for people researching what to buy — and influencers and reviews are an effective method of getting sales. You can leverage that by participating in affiliate marketing as a YouTuber.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube"><a href="#How-Does-Affiliate-Marketing-Work-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?"></a><strong>How Does Affiliate Marketing Work On YouTube?</strong></h4><p>As a YouTuber, you can share your thoughts on products or services, and if there are products that you recommend, by simply adding a personalized link to the product page, you can get a commission for every sale of that product that came through your link.</p><p>The average affiliate commission rate is between 5% to 30%, with a lot of variables. Some low price range items will have a higher commission, while higher-priced items will have lower commissions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliat-link8.jpg"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><p><em>Travel YouTuber,</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SorelleIAm"><em>Sorelle Amore</em></a><em>’s affiliate links to her vlogging gears.</em></p><p> Keep in mind that people are most likely going to take recommendations from people they trust. You wouldn’t buy a computer from a nutritionist and you wouldn’t buy vitamins from a gamer, so consider what you are an expert in and what products you have the most authority to speak about.</p><h4 id="What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing"><a href="#What-Videos-Are-Best-for-Affiliate-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?"></a><strong>What Videos Are Best for Affiliate Marketing?</strong></h4><p>There are no restrictions on what will make a good affiliate marketing video, but there are best practices.</p><p>What’s important is understanding the purpose of the video. If the video is about vlogging microphones, then it makes complete sense to have an affiliate link to your favorite microphone. Odds are the people who are watching the video may be considering buying a new microphone, so the link is helpful for them.</p><p>Here are a few types of videos that make for good affiliate marketing opportunities:</p><p>- Product reviews</p><p>- Top 10</p><p>- How-tos</p><p>- Cheap vs expensive</p><p>- What to pack for…</p><p> <strong>How to Get an Affiliate Marketing Link for YouTube?</strong></p><p>Which affiliate marketing program you choose to sign up with will depend on the products you want to link to through your content. Do some research on what each network has to offer in regards to your niche.</p><p>Here is the list of 4 popular affiliate marketing networks:</p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" >Amazon Associates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://rakutenmarketing.com/affiliate" >Rakuten <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://www.shareasale.com/" >ShareASale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>- <a class="link"   href="https://peerfly.com/" >PeerFly <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can also partner with brands directly as many of them, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.sephora.com/affiliates" >Sephora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and <a class="link"   href="https://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/affiliate-program" >Canon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, will have their own affiliate program.</p><h2 id="3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships"><a href="#3-Brand-Deal-or-Sponsorships" class="headerlink" title="3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:"></a><strong>3. Brand Deal or Sponsorships:</strong></h2><p>Selling out, that is often the thought when we hear creators getting brand deals and sponsorships, but that stigma is unfounded if the brand and the content are properly aligned. As your channel grows, you will begin to recognize brands that match your values — and the values of your viewers — and those that don’t.</p><p>Today, more and more brands are collaborating with YouTube creators, because <a class="link"   href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/youtube-influencer-marketing-rulebook/" >creators are 4x more effective in earning brand familiarity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> than collaborations with traditional celebrities.</p><p>In an ad for Beats by Dre’s #BuiltForBosses campaign, YouTuber <a class="link"   href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-self-made-star-shows-one-way-to-crack-the-gen-z-code-1511719567?mod=e2tw" >Liza Koshy outperformed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> the likes of Tom Brady and DJ Khaled.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/perform-the-likes9.jpg"                      alt="perform the likes"                ></p><p>While it does take significant effort on YouTube to acquire a following, it is possible for a YouTube channel with 1,000 subscribers to get a brand deal. Getting the buy-in from brands is a numbers game, and according to <a class="link"   href="https://videocreators.com/how-to-get-started-with-brand-deals-on-youtube/" >Video Creators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the minimal number of views per video shouldn’t be lower than 2,000 if this is the path you want to head in.</p><h4 id="How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands"><a href="#How-to-Get-Discovered-By-Brands" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Discovered By Brands"></a><strong>How to Get Discovered By Brands</strong></h4><p>The decision-makers behind brands might not be aware of influencers with a smaller following — those who have just cracked the 5,000 subscriber mark. The odds of a brand reaching out to you, as a small creator, is unlikely to happen.</p><p>If you want to get a brand deal and become an influencer on YouTube, then you will have to put yourself out there to be discovered and that is on an Influencer Marketing Network, such as <a class="link"   href="https://famebit.com/" >Famebit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/famebit-brand10.jpg"                      alt="famebit brand"                ></p><h4 id="How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works"><a href="#How-Influencer-Marketing-Platforms-Like-Famebit-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works"></a><strong>How Influencer Marketing Platforms Like Famebit Works</strong></h4><p>When you sign up for Famebit or other influencer marketing platforms you have an opportunity to get in front of brands who are seeking influencers to share their product or service.</p><p>Steps to getting a brand deal:</p><ol><li>Find brands and campaigns that match your audience.</li><li>Pitch your creative ideas and present the proposal to the brand within their parameters (product review, 30-60 shoutout, etc.)</li><li>If accepted, you are hired and will begin collaboration with the brand to produce the project.</li><li>Build our content.</li><li>Receive approval from the brand.</li><li>Get Paid!</li></ol><p> Unlike celebrity marketing, YouTube creators have shown brands over the years that they are inventive and clever with how they can present the brand to the audience to drive the best results. This type of independence is what makes YouTube influencer marketing special.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><h2 id="4-Crowdfunding"><a href="#4-Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="4. Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>4. Crowdfunding:</strong></h2><p>If you are creating valuable content and have a loyal following, you can start thinking about crowdfunding. It doesn’t take stardom to start asking for donations, pledge, or support from your fans. There is a demand for quality content and if you are creating something of value, even on a free service like YouTube, people will happily pay to support it.</p><p>But how can you approach crowdfunding so it doesn’t look like you are begging?</p><h4 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Crowdfunding" class="headerlink" title="3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:"></a><strong>3 Popular Types of Crowdfunding:</strong></h4><p><strong>- Tiered Rewards: You can give incentives for your patrons in different tiers. Example: a donation of $2-$10 gives them a shoutout in your next video, a donation of $20-$100 gets them an exclusive spot in a live stream, and more extravagant offerings as the donations increase.</strong></p><p><strong>- Membership:</strong> This method of crowdfunding allows your fans to donate on a recurring basis. Treat your channel like it’s HBO and deliver higher-value content. Your members will be the first to see the increase of quality in and frequency of your work.</p><p>- <strong>Project-based:</strong>  Is there a special project you have in mind, get support for it. A longer-form video or one that your fans have been wanting for a while, by highlighting this anticipated project, you can get more backing behind it financially.</p><p> From Sept-Oct 2011, the YouTube channel Freddiew (aka RocketJump) went on <a class="link"   href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freddiew/video-game-high-school" >Kickstarter to crowdfund <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>so they can produce a web series called Video Game High School. In 30 days, they were able to surpass their goal of $75,000 with $273,725 and 5,661 backers. The result is a multiple season web series, the first one published onto YouTube in May 2012.</p><p> Without crowdfunding, the project would unlikely have been produced and published for viewers in such a short amount of time.</p><h4 id="Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations"><a href="#Set-Crowdfunding-Goals-to-Encourage-Donations" class="headerlink" title="Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations"></a><strong>Set Crowdfunding Goals to Encourage Donations</strong></h4><p>Have you ever gone up to a friend and ask for $5? What did they say?</p><p>“What do you need it for?”</p><p>We are more willing to give money if we know where it is going. Let your audience know exactly what you are planning to spend the funds on and how it will benefit them. One way to really encourage them is to have a goal, for example, a trip to a conference, and a special video will be produced to highlight the event.</p><h4 id="Set-a-Target"><a href="#Set-a-Target" class="headerlink" title="Set a $ Target"></a><strong>Set a $ Target</strong></h4><p>If you have a pie in the sky goal, you aren’t going to fully leverage the message to your audience. Understand how much money you need to produce a video or to pursue a more ambitious project. What do you need in order to grow and make the best channel you can.</p><h4 id="How-Does-Patreon-Work-for-YouTubers"><a href="#How-Does-Patreon-Work-for-YouTubers" class="headerlink" title="How Does Patreon Work for YouTubers?"></a><strong>How Does Patreon Work for YouTubers?</strong></h4><p>When it comes to crowdfunding for YouTubers, <a class="link"   href="https://www.patreon.com/" >Patreon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is the platform of choice. While other platforms such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe are focused on entrepreneurial pursuits, large projects, or charitable causes, Patreon is designed to support creatives and reward and incentivize donors.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways:"></a><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h2><p>There are many ways to make money off of YouTube, I encourage you to try a few of these different strategies and see how they perform and which one suits your channel and your audience the best.</p><ol><li>Directing your viewers to your website where they can pay for a product or service that you offer.</li><li>Sign up with an affiliate program such as Amazon Associates and create content about interesting products.</li><li>Find brands that match your channel’s values and propose ideas via influencer marketing platforms such as Famebit.</li><li>Set up a Patreon page and encourage viewers to donate to get incentives or to support a bigger better project.</li></ol><p>Got questions about making money on YouTube?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discover-the-Power-of-Proportions-in-YouTube-Content-Creation"><a href="#Discover-the-Power-of-Proportions-in-YouTube-Content-Creation" class="headerlink" title="Discover the Power of Proportions in YouTube Content Creation"></a>Discover the Power of Proportions in YouTube Content Creation</h2><p>Yes, you are right. Social media is the platform that no one can refrain from in the current world of technology, news, events, and friends. One such platform gained so much popularity in the last few years. That is YouTube, a platform that is used worldwide for a multitude of purposes. Such as watching videos, uploading or sharing videos, tutorials, trends, series, coaching, serials, shorts videos, news, events, displaying ads, and lots more. No doubt, the list is endless.</p><p>Well, while dealing with YouTube videos, there is one most crucial point to keep in mind. If you have a vision or some thought, you can create a new genre of video under YouTube. And that is the YouTube Aspect Ratio, to have the best visual experience for the users worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-platform.jpg"                      alt="youtube platform"                ></p><p>Aspect ratio is simply the width to the height ratio for the screen. But it holds great value to create a difference while displaying YouTube Shorts Videos with proper ratio and size as it is only then that it will get proper attention and get trends.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads](#Part 3)</p><p>04 [Think More about YouTube Aspect Ratio](#Part 4)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Aspect-Ratio-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 1 Aspect Ratio for YouTube Videos</h2><p>YouTube is the platform that demands perfection, not in terms of the content of the video only, but there are some other aspects that one needs to consider. So, what could be the right approach while dealing with YouTube Video or Photo size? Thinking what could that be? Well, friends, it is the YouTube Video Ratio or, in simple terms, YouTube Aspect Ratio that tells a lot about the visual representation of the video. If YouTube Video dimension size is not as per the required parameter or according to the device screen, it is so. Then YouTube itself makes adjustments to the rest of the video corners filled with either white or grey bar, which is not the right approach for an appropriate user experience. For that, you must be aware of the required width and height of YouTube Video, that is, YouTube Video Aspect Ratio. Below are covered prime devices with their YouTube Aspect Ratio and related information. Go through them to get the basic idea:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube aspect ratio"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> YouTube Video Player can adjust the video size automatically to make it fit into the screen. Sometimes, doing so results in a bar’s white or grey&#x2F;black area along the edges.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Aspect Ratio for Desktop&#x2F;PC Version:</p><p>If you are a desktop, PC, or laptop user, the standard YouTube Aspect ratio is 16:9, which is for landscape view. In the case of vertical video with a YouTube Aspect Ratio of 9:16, YouTube will make some adjustments by providing padding to the corner of the video. (That is not the right way for the optimum view as it may result in interfering with the dynamic vision of the YouTube Video.)</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for Android devices:</p><p>There is an interesting fact about the YouTube Video Ratio for Android devices. Actually, in the case of Android mobile devices, the YouTube app will make an auto adjustment to the video file size and set the video as per the screen space.</p><p><strong>●</strong> YouTube Video Ratio for iOS Version</p><p>Like Android phones, iOS devices such as iPhone, iPad, YouTube App player will also automatically adjust the Video file size to fit the screen. It does not matter whether the video is in Square, horizontal or vertical format; it will auto-adjust the aspect ratio.</p><p>Let’s take the example of Vertical Video display in YouTube Screen:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/vertical-video-example.jpg"                      alt="vertical video example"                ></p><p>Also, by selecting the Expand option, the video will adjust itself to fill the entire screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-YouTube-Shorts-Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio"></a>Part 2 YouTube Shorts Aspect Ratio</h2><p>The world is moving swiftly, and with day passing, people want to complete their tasks as quickly as possible. The impact is seen in the field of the YouTube Video making process also with the introduction of YouTube Shorts. After following the short video trends of TikTok, this time YouTube appeared with its new feature YouTube Shorts, which allows a user to create a short video that ranges from 15 to 60 seconds. The only need is for a Smartphone and YouTube Application Shorts camera. And then you are good to go. Note that YouTube Shorts videos get searched and watched by people mainly through their phones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-shorts-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube shorts ratio"                ></p><p>Here also comes the concept of YouTube Shorts Ratio as YouTube Videos primarily follows Vertical format. Following are the requirement for YouTube Shorts Ratio:</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Vertical format standard ratio is 9:16 (That fill up the entire screen vertically)</p><p><strong>Resolution:</strong> To comply with vertical format, the required resolution is 1920X1080 px.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There is also provision for square videos with a 1:1 ratio for YouTube Shorts. But that results in extra white or black padding at the top and bottom areas.</p><p>Other possible YouTube Shorts ratios are 4:5, 2:3, 1:2.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads"><a href="#Part-3-Aspect-Ratios-for-YouTube-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads"></a>Part 3 Aspect Ratios for YouTube Ads</h2><p>If you want to monetize from your video or Shorts, use YouTube Ads to generate additional income. Or, if you are already in some business and want to grow your business, do it with YouTube Ads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-ads-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="youtube-ads-aspect-ratio"                ></p><p>Now, you might be wondering, what would be the possible YouTube Outro size or YouTube Video Aspect Ratio for YouTube Ads?

That is how YouTube works for you. This article is about how YouTube works technically. There are a lot of steps which occur between you clicking ‘upload’ and a viewer clicking ‘play’. Understanding this process can be useful to YouTubers because it can help shed light on where problems may be occurring when you have issues uploading or watching videos. Generally when there is a problem it is on your end and there are multiple simple things you can do to fix it.</p><p>This article will explain what goes on behind the scenes when you upload a video, where that video really goes, and what happens when somebody clicks play.</p><h2 id="How-Does-YouTube-Work"><a href="#How-Does-YouTube-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does YouTube Work"></a>How Does YouTube Work</h2><h4 id="1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload"><a href="#1-What-Happens-When-You-Upload" class="headerlink" title="1. What Happens When You Upload?"></a>1. What Happens When You Upload?</h4><p>When you upload a video your computer or device packages it into IP packets. Packets are fragments of information containing both data from your video and the address you are sending it to, in this case YouTube. The packets are encoded into radio signals which are sent through a wifi or cellular network. Your video travels through switches and routers on the internet until they reach YouTube’s servers. Your video is then reassembled and stored.</p><p>If uploading takes a long time for you it probably has nothing to do with YouTube; there is a lot that needs to happen for your video to even get there. How long the upload process takes depends on a number of factors including how many devices share your internet connection, how strong your wifi signal is, and the age of your router. If your uploads are taking too long consider compressing your videos before you upload them. You can also try uploading from your college campus or public libraries as institutions like these tend to have fast internet speeds.</p><h4 id="2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored"><a href="#2-Where-is-Your-Video-Stored" class="headerlink" title="2. Where is Your Video Stored?"></a>2. Where is Your Video Stored?</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-youtube-works.JPG"                      alt="how youtube works"                ></p><p>As it is owned by Google YouTube uses Google’s ‘Bigtable’, a compressed data storage system which allows it to store the 500+ hours of video uploaded to its servers every minute. Bigtable is software, though, not hardware. YouTube and Google both have massive amounts of data and it needs to be physically housed somewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videos-uploaded-to-youtube.jpg"                      alt="videos uploaded to youtube"                ></p><p>Google has Modular Data Centers all over the world where it keeps its servers. These centers could cost as much as $600 million dollars each and consume huge amounts of electricity. There are six of them in the United States, three in Europe, two in Asia, and one is South America.</p><h4 id="3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video"><a href="#3-What-Happens-When-Someone-Watches-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?"></a>3. What Happens When Someone Watches Your Video?</h4><p>When a viewer clicks on your video their computer sends an encoded request through the internet to YouTube’s servers. After YouTube receives the play request it chooses which format to play the video in based on the viewer’s browser. Your video is again turned into packets, which are again sent as radio signals over the internet to your viewer. Your viewer’s computer or device reforms the packets into your video and their browser plays it.</p><p>If videos take a long time to load for you then there are a few things you can do to speed them up. First, consider changing the channel of your wifi router. Most people stay on the channel their router was set to when they first got it and so there is a good chance you and your neighbors are all on the same channel. This causes your networks to interfere with each other. You can also delete the temporary files on your computer. Besides helping you stream video faster this will free up storage space. Another thing you can do is make sure there are as few devices connected to your network as possible while you are watching videos. Besides mobile phones and laptops you may have appliances, like coffee machines and refrigerators, which are wifi enabled. Disconnect them temporarily and it will help your videos to load faster.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/crafting-engaging-youtube-end-credits-for-2024/"><u>Crafting Engaging YouTube End Credits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-discovering-the-top-10-most-watched-youtubers/"><u>[New] Discovering the Top 10 Most Watched YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/keeping-viewers-hooked-the-ultimate-guide-for-enhanced-audience-loyalty-on-youtube/"><u>Keeping Viewers Hooked  The Ultimate Guide for Enhanced Audience Loyalty on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-viral-videos-on-youtube-a-strategic-plan/"><u>[Updated] Crafting Viral Videos on YouTube  A Strategic Plan</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-channelart-essentials-10-digital-tools-to-design-logos-and-themes/"><u>[New] ChannelArt Essentials  10 Digital Tools to Design Logos & Themes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/scrutinizing-success-identifying-the-top-10-most-subscribed-youtubers/"><u>Scrutinizing Success  Identifying the Top 10 Most-Subscribed YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/discovering-popular-video-threads-for-2024/"><u>Discovering Popular Video Threads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/essential-guide-top-10-youtube-yoga-sessions-for-gains/"><u>Essential Guide  Top 10 YouTube Yoga Sessions for Gains</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/which-is-the-best-fake-gps-joystick-app-on-apple-iphone-xs-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Which is the Best Fake GPS Joystick App On Apple iPhone XS Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-step-by-step-guide-to-pc-based-live-broadcasts-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] In 2024, Step-by-Step Guide to PC-Based Live Broadcasts on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/2024-approved-this-well-written-article-will-share-a-descriptive-method-on-how-to-stream-zoom-to-youtube-quickly-by-doing-so-you-can-share-your-zoom-session/"><u>2024 Approved This Well-Written Article Will Share a Descriptive Method on How to Stream Zoom to YouTube Quickly.
