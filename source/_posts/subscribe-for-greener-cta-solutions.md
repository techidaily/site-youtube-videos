## Methods to add a subscribe button to your video

Viewers are not likely to subscribe to any channel if they are not guided. One best method is to engage a subscribe button to your video and draw the attention of as many as possible.

#### 1 Use Subscribe Green Screen

Put your green screen to work by subscribing to it. Follow these steps to produce eye-catching videos, with a call to action closing point.

**Step 1\. Set screen**
You need to create a background at the Studio – and that's the green screen. Keenly hand it on a frame before you start filming. Also, note that no wrinkles or fold-ups are visible.

![how to make subscribe green screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-2.png)

**Step 2\. Adjust lighting**  
Lighting is important to facilitate high-resolution video output quality. Put appropriate lighting settings to avoid directional shadows and get the best results.

**Step 3\. Set up the subject**  
Give ample space between the subject and the green screen for an effective outcome. If they are too close, there will be a reflection of the green screen on the subject. It isn't professional as it will be hard when it comes to matching to a different background.

![make your own green screen - set up the object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-3.png)

**Step 4\. Start filming**  
Begin to film your video and ensure you take various shots for comparison. It is good to film at different angles to see what works best.

**Step 5\. Polish the rough cut**  
Tune all the footage to perfect video clips. It will save your efforts when keying out green screen footage. Remove the unwanted parts by trimming. You can also do other edits like merge and split where necessary.

**Step 6\. Key out the footage and edit the green screen**  
Your footage is now ready, and you are now free to edit the green screen. It is better to engage reliable editing software to remove the green traces in the shot.

**Step 7\. Paste the new background**  
Any background concept can now fit in. Add your desired background video or image in a new layer below the subject. You can continue to make other necessary adjustments like sharpness and hue for reality.

**Step 8\. Add Call To Action**  
Finally, tell your viewers to subscribe to your YouTube channel while watching the video. You can also introduce your other channels that aren't yet known or those that have not reached 1,000 subscribers.

#### 2 Using YouTube Studio

You can also enable the green screen to subscribe via the YouTube Studio. It is a YouTube application that provides you with the tools you need to create a successful YouTube channel. You can manage your videos, respond to comments and even add adverts to your content for pay. Here are the steps to add subscribe button.

**Step 1**. First, go directly to "studio.youtube.com" or click on your profile picture on the YouTube page to launch YT Studio.

![add subscirbe button using youtube studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-5.png)

**Step 2**. Click on the "Menu" option and choose the "Settings"> "Channel" option.

![add subscirbe button using youtube studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/subscribe-green-screen-6.png)

**Step 3**. Then select the "Choose" image and select which subscribe button image you wish to use as your branding watermark. You can easily get one on the Google images section.

**Step 4**. Next, choose the display time for the branding watermark. It could be a custom start time if you want the branding watermark to start showing at a specific time. You can also choose "End or video" for it to appear at the last 10 to 15 seconds of your video. Likewise, the branding watermark can show throughout the video if you choose the "Entire video" option.

**Step 5**. Finally, save the changes. Voila! Viewers can subscribe to your channel easily, with a single click of a button.

#### 3 Using Subscribe Effects

You can also use the subscribers' effects to add a Call To Action. Remember, your main aim is to increase the audience to your channel. And in most cases, viewers forget to subscribe even though they love your video. Perhaps they don't understand the importance it holds to your channel. You can do this using a reliable video editor software – Filmora.
