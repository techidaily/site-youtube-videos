YouTube is a great platform where almost everyone goes to watches videos. It is not the best platform for every video creator, though. This article will introduce you to some YouTube alternatives.

There are a lot of reasons you might want to learn about other websites like YouTube. You might want a site with less ads, or different ways of monetizing. YouTube can sometimes remove videos unfairly, so you may want a site where copyright claims are handled by people instead of robots. A lot of users simply want a site that is more like YouTube was when it was younger. There are features, like customizable channel pages, which have been discarded over the years.

## YouTube Alternatives: 3 Best Video Sharing Sites

Here is a list of other places where you can upload videos:

#### 1\. Dailymotion

![YouTune Alternatives - Dailymotion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-dailymotion.JPG)

This may be the second most popular free video sharing website, and it is very similar to YouTube in appearance. Like YouTube, Dailymotion recommends videos to users based on what is trending as well as their personal viewing habits. Also like YouTube, there are ads in and around videos and you have the option of monetizing your content to earn ad revenue. There is more than one way to become a Dailymotion partner, though. You can sell a subscription for your channel instead of monetizing ads in your videos.

The main difference between Dailymotion and YouTube is that where YouTube has an abundance of both amateur and professional quality video, Dailymotion skews towards professional. There are personal vlogs and cat videos, but these are less the norm on Dailymotion than on YouTube. You may find less competition in your genre here. However, you should be aware that the expectations of viewers might be higher.

#### 2\. Vimeo

![YouTube Alternatives - Vimeo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternative-vimeo.JPG)

Although Vimeo is also a very popular video site, it is very different from YouTube. Everything from appearance to the types of comments left on videos is vastly different. The front page of this site does not display trending videos, for example. Instead it features high quality creative content that has been reviewed and singled out by Vimeo’s staff as some of the best the site has to offer.

There also are not any ads on Vimeo, whereas YouTube is full of them.

If you create, or are interested in creating, short films then this is where you should be posting. Many festival quality shorts are posted to Vimeo. There are vlogs there too, but they tend to be by serious video creators. The community on Vimeo tends to be a lot friendlier than YouTube so if you are still an amateur, but have dreams of being a pro, then this is probably still the site for you. You should be able to find real constructive criticism here rather than trolls.

Vimeo has a wider variety of privacy settings than YouTube. You can make videos watchable by everyone, just certain people, or require a password.

#### 3\. ZippCast

![YouTune Alternatives - ZippCast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/alternatives-zippcast.JPG)

ZippCast is praised by some for being very similar to pre-Google YouTube. While the expectations for video quality may be slightly higher on DailyMotion than YouTube, and are much higher on Vimeo, they are basically the same on ZippCast. Comedy, gaming, music, animation, and vlogging are the most popular categories and almost all content is posted by average people with average skill levels. One of the ways in which ZippCast is like the ‘old’ YouTube is that you can customize the design of your channel.

One of the things users appreciate most about ZippCast is that identifying and removing copyrighted videos is done by humans rather than an automated system, like on YouTube. This means that if you use copyrighted content that is licensed to you or protected by fair use your video should not be taken down. It is common for YouTubers to have their videos unfairly removed, although disputing the copyright claim will usually result in getting the video restored.

Although it is definitely large enough to be considered an alternative to YouTube, ZippCast has been unreliable in the past (i.e shutting down randomly) and has lost the trust of many users.

## Top 10 Most Watched YouTube Video in 24 Hours

Music videos get the most views in 24 hours YouTube because fans of these artists can repeatedly play the songs. Here are ten YouTube videos that had the most views in a day.

#### 1) Butter - BTS

With 108 million views in one day, Butter by BTS is undoubtedly the video with the most YouTube views in 24 hours. It is also the fastest YouTube video, as it reached 30 million views in 2 hours 20 minutes.

In the video, the superstar septet — Jin, Jimin, V, Jung Kook, J-Hope, Suga, and RM — appear in black-and-white, and they are wearing slick suits before it changes to color. They are rapping, singing, and dancing, with each one taking a turn to groove in an elevator. They also dance in a gymnasium and appear together on stage under pulsating lights.

#### 2) Dynamite - BTS

Released on August 21, 2020, Dynamite by BTS hit 101.1 million views in 24 hours. That makes it the second most watched YouTube video in 24 hours. This upbeat disco-pop track has soul and funk elements inspired by the Seventies and Eighties. And this theme echoes in the vintage-inspired outfits the members are wearing and the nostalgic settings in the music video.

In the background, viewers will see a warmly-lit record store and poster-studded bedroom that has tributes to The Beatles and David Bowie. The choreography includes shoutouts to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley and easy-to-follow freestyle dance moves that correspond well with the music.

#### 3) How You Like That - Blackpink

How You Like That is one of the videos that had the most views in 24 hours YouTube, as it managed to get 86.3 million views in 24 hours. In the beginning scene of the videos, the four artists sit like queens atop steps. They dance in several positions, including the Arctic, a trapezoidal hall, and a jungle.

The quartet is united in a dance break inside a grand domed hall at the end of this colorful music video. Here, the backup dancers surround the South Korean girl group.

#### 4) Ice Cream - Black Wink Ft Selena Gomez

Ice Cream by Blackpink and Selena Gomez is another video with the most YouTube views in 24 hours. It hit 79 million views on YouTube in 24 hours.

The video shows Blackpink and Gomes in several colorful outfits and sets. It starts with the scene of Gomez wearing a candy-striped bikini with a white sailor hat and gold hoop earrings; she is driving an ice cream truck packed with Serendipity Ice Cream. The members of Blackpink then appear and pop up smiling behind cardboard cutouts.

For the second post-chorus, the quartet appears in a pink ice cream parlor, and they are wearing black-and-white outfits and holding ice cream.

#### 5) BTS and Halsey’s Boy With Luv

Boy With Luv had hit 74.6 million views on YouTube within 24 hours of its release. When the music video was released in 2019, it became the fastest-viewed and liked YouTube video, reaching 3 million likes in just 2 hours.

The music video features brightly-hued scenes with retro-feeling looks from the Bangtan Boys. These include fedoras, feathered blazers, and bright pink smoking jackets. It also emphasizes the group's past through signage with phrases like Love and Persona.

#### 6) Lalisa - Lisa

Lalisa by the Thai singer and rapper Lisa reached 73.6 million views on YouTube the day of its release. The visual includes multiple costume changes, including a detailed ensemble inspired by traditional Thai culture. The musician is seen sitting on an elaborately-sculpted throne wearing a tall pointed headdress, a golden beaded dress with a cape, and ear cuffs with golden jasmine.

#### 7) Permission to Dance - BTS

This video had 72.3 million views on YouTube within 24 hours of release and became the 6th most watched YouTube video in 24 hours.

This video was released on November 19, 2020, and it quickly gained 71.6 million views in 24 hours. Life Goes on by BTS became the fifth most watched YouTube video in 24 hours on its release. In the music video, members of the group appear to be lazing around their dorm. V then drives them around, and they later watch films and go to an empty stadium where they perform the song.

#### 9) Nain Bengali - Guru Randhawa

Nain Bengali is the first Indian music video to earn 71.4 million views on YouTube within 24 hours of its release. The music video shows Randhawa in a chick look. The artist experimented with a different look by dying his spike gray. Additionally, his confidence adds more elegance to his appearance. Guru also choreographed his moves in the video.

#### 10) Me! - Taylor Swift and Brendon Urie

When Me! was released on April 26, 2019, it amassed 65.2 million YouTube views in 24 hours and broke the record previously held by Thank U, Next by Ariana Grande. The video also surpassed Taylor's record set in 2017 with the music video Look What You Made Me Do.

The video is set in a chrysalis, and it opens with a scene of a snake slithering on a floor; it explodes into colorful butterflies to show the end of Taylor's previous era. The video pans up to Urie and Taylor engaging in an argument. Taylor is donning a beautiful black and white tule dress that has floral accents.
