 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Shooting a video has never been easier because there are [so many different cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can use to capture the footage for your YouTube video. In the past, professional video equipment has been expensive and difficult to operate, but all of this has changed with the invention of digital cameras.

 On the other hand, buying the most expensive microphones, lighting equipment or cameras doesn't guarantee that your videos will be a major success once you post them on YouTube. Instead, you should look for the equipment that is best suited for the type of videos you want to create. Let's explore the equipment that is necessary for running a successful YouTube channel.

## What Equipment Will You Need to Start Your New YouTube Channel?

 The process of creating a video can be divided into three different stages, the pre-production, production, and post-production. Each stage has its own tools, without which completing a video would be impossible. In this article, we will be covering the equipment that will make the production stage of the process much smoother, and it will also help you to go through post-production much faster.

### Equipment 1: Camera

 You can't shoot a video without a camera, but which camera you're going to use depends on the type of the video you want to produce. Sometimes the camera that offers the most shooting options is not the best choice, and different factors like size or the weight of the camera can be much more important than the sheer quality of the footage.

#### 1. Cellphone Cameras

 If you own a [smartphone]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/mobile-video-editing/best-smartphones-for-recording-video.html), you already have a camera you can use to create a YouTube video. Mobile phone cameras are easy to operate and they are perfect for shooting videos while you are on the go. However, most phones are incredibly light and holding the device in your hand while shooting may produce camera shakes that ruin the video. You'll also need a third-party app in order to control all of the camera settings manually.

 You can also [make YouTube videos with just your phone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), check this video for more details.

#### 2. Action Cameras

 If you are a fan of outdoor activities and you want to shoot your YouTube videos while you're having an adventure action cam may be your best choice. The GoPro and all similar types of cameras are small, lightweight, and they can produce videos in high resolution. Most of these cameras come with mounts and accessories that enable you to shoot perfectly stable footage while you are climbing, running or walking.

 We have composed some useful tips and trick of buying and using action camera, in cast that you want to buy an action camera for shooting videos, do check out this [ultimate action camera guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 3. Camcorders

 YouTubers that often shoot videos on different locations, can hardly go wrong if they decide to capture their videos with a camcorder. The best models on the market enable you to shoot 4K videos, even in less than perfect light conditions and you can also adjust the camera settings manually. Camcorders are a great choice if you want to make sure that your footage always looks great, regardless of the location on which you recorded it.

 If you want to buy a camcorder to shoot your YouTube vlog video, please do check this list of [best 4k camcorders that you can buy.]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/4k/top-best-4k-camcorders.html)

#### 4. Mirrorless Cameras

 Besides offering superb image quality, mirrorless cameras also let you change lenses so you get the best shot in every scene you want to include in your video. These types of cameras are a popular choice for vlogging or capturing footage for all types of YouTube videos because they feature professional video recording options while remaining relatively lightweight and easy to carry around. However, the best mirrorless cameras on the market can be quite expensive, and you must be prepared to invest money in lenses and other equipment.

 If you want to buy a mirrorless camera to shoot your YouTube vlog video, please do check this list of [best 4k mirrorless cameras.]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/4k/best-4k-mirrorless-camera.html)

#### 5. DSLR Cameras

 Seasoned professionals, as well as the newcomers to the world of video production, can benefit from using a DSLR camera for shooting the content for their YouTube channel. These types of cameras allow you to change lenses, pull focus manually, shoot at different frame rates or capture the footage in 4K and Full HD quality. What's more, you can use a DSLR camera even in challenging light conditions, because most models support ISO sensitivity values that enable the camera to produce remarkable image quality even when the amount of light in a shot is far from perfect.

 With a DSLR camera, you can also use it a webcam for recording your face and your desktop screen at the same time, check [how to use a DSLR camera as a webcam]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/webcam-recording/use-dslr-camera-as-webcam.html).

### Equipment 2: Microphones

 Moving images are less effective without sound, which is the reason why you should pay close attention to this aspect of the video making process. All cameras have built-in microphones, but the audio quality they produce is often not good enough to actually use it in a YouTube video. That's why recording sound with an external microphone is a common practice among the most successful YouTubers.

 The location at which you're shooting the video will help you determine which microphone you should use for that project. If you are recording your YouTube video in the exterior an omnidirectional microphone is your best choice because it will eliminate the wind noise. Furthermore, as their name suggests these microphones can pick up sounds from all directions so people in your videos don't have to speak directly into the microphone.

 Shotgun or unidirectional mics are frequently used in studio conditions when you want to eliminate all other sounds except the narrator's voice. Gamers, tutorial makers and all other YouTube content creators that rely heavily on narration in their videos use shotgun mics because they produce great audio quality. Even though it is easy to overlook the importance of sound for the overall quality of the video you're working on, a video with great audio quality may actually help you attract more followers on YouTube.

### Equipment 3: Video Stabilization Equipment

 Holding a camera in your hand while shooting a video is often not the best idea, because even breathing may cause the camera to move and produce camera shakes. That's where [tripods](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), steadicams, [gimbals](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), rigs and other video stabilization equipment comes in. As a matter of fact, you should only shoot handheld videos when you want to achieve this effect, while all another camera movement should be avoided without the use of appropriate equipment.

 Shaky videos are not very pleasant to watch and they can reduce your chances of attracting more followers on YouTube. The video stabilization equipment offers a great solution, and you can get a professional tripod or gimbal at a very reasonable price. However, which video stabilization equipment you are going to use depends on the camera you have and the type of shot you want to get.

### Equipment 4: Lighting Equipment

 Instead of struggling with natural light sources and having to deal with shadows, you can simply use the [lighting equipment](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to equalize the light values in a shot. Of course, whether or not you will use artificial light in your video depends on a number of factors, including the location and the visual style you're trying to achieve.

 Whether you will use an on-camera LED light, ring light or softbox video lights is yet another creative decision you will have to make during the process of shooting your YouTube video. The great majority of video lighting equipment produces the best results in controlled, studio-like conditions, so before you go ahead and buy an on-camera light or a softbox make sure that you know how the equipment will perform on the interior and exterior locations.

**Conclusion**

 Producing YouTube videos on a constant basis requires you to have the right equipment for the job. You don't have to shoot your videos with the most expensive camera out there or have the best microphone on the market in order to create a great YouTube video, but having the equipment capable of delivering a professional level of video and audio quality won't hurt your chances of becoming a successful YouTuber.

 We'd love to hear all about the gear you're using to capture your videos, so leave a comment and let us know.

These types of cameras are a popular choice for vlogging or capturing footage for all types of YouTube videos because they feature professional video recording options while remaining relatively lightweight and easy to carry around. However, the best mirrorless cameras on the market can be quite expensive, and you must be prepared to invest money in lenses and other equipment.

 If you want to buy a mirrorless camera to shoot your YouTube vlog video, please do check this list of [best 4k mirrorless cameras.]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/4k/best-4k-mirrorless-camera.html)

#### 5. DSLR Cameras

 Seasoned professionals, as well as the newcomers to the world of video production, can benefit from using a DSLR camera for shooting the content for their YouTube channel. These types of cameras allow you to change lenses, pull focus manually, shoot at different frame rates or capture the footage in 4K and Full HD quality. What's more, you can use a DSLR camera even in challenging light conditions, because most models support ISO sensitivity values that enable the camera to produce remarkable image quality even when the amount of light in a shot is far from perfect.

 With a DSLR camera, you can also use it a webcam for recording your face and your desktop screen at the same time, check [how to use a DSLR camera as a webcam]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/webcam-recording/use-dslr-camera-as-webcam.html).

### Equipment 2: Microphones

 Moving images are less effective without sound, which is the reason why you should pay close attention to this aspect of the video making process. All cameras have built-in microphones, but the audio quality they produce is often not good enough to actually use it in a YouTube video. That's why recording sound with an external microphone is a common practice among the most successful YouTubers.

 The location at which you're shooting the video will help you determine which microphone you should use for that project. If you are recording your YouTube video in the exterior an omnidirectional microphone is your best choice because it will eliminate the wind noise. Furthermore, as their name suggests these microphones can pick up sounds from all directions so people in your videos don't have to speak directly into the microphone.

 Shotgun or unidirectional mics are frequently used in studio conditions when you want to eliminate all other sounds except the narrator's voice. Gamers, tutorial makers and all other YouTube content creators that rely heavily on narration in their videos use shotgun mics because they produce great audio quality. Even though it is easy to overlook the importance of sound for the overall quality of the video you're working on, a video with great audio quality may actually help you attract more followers on YouTube.

### Equipment 3: Video Stabilization Equipment

 Holding a camera in your hand while shooting a video is often not the best idea, because even breathing may cause the camera to move and produce camera shakes. That's where [tripods](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), steadicams, [gimbals](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), rigs and other video stabilization equipment comes in. As a matter of fact, you should only shoot handheld videos when you want to achieve this effect, while all another camera movement should be avoided without the use of appropriate equipment.

 Shaky videos are not very pleasant to watch and they can reduce your chances of attracting more followers on YouTube. The video stabilization equipment offers a great solution, and you can get a professional tripod or gimbal at a very reasonable price. However, which video stabilization equipment you are going to use depends on the camera you have and the type of shot you want to get.

 Check our list of [best camera stabilizer for YouTubers in 2018]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/vlogger/best-camera-stabilizers-for-youtube.html).

### Equipment 4: Lighting Equipment

 Instead of struggling with natural light sources and having to deal with shadows, you can simply use the [lighting equipment](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to equalize the light values in a shot. Of course, whether or not you will use artificial light in your video depends on a number of factors, including the location and the visual style you're trying to achieve.

 Whether you will use an on-camera LED light, ring light or softbox video lights is yet another creative decision you will have to make during the process of shooting your YouTube video. The great majority of video lighting equipment produces the best results in controlled, studio-like conditions, so before you go ahead and buy an on-camera light or a softbox make sure that you know how the equipment will perform on the interior and exterior locations.

**Conclusion**

 Producing YouTube videos on a constant basis requires you to have the right equipment for the job. You don't have to shoot your videos with the most expensive camera out there or have the best microphone on the market in order to create a great YouTube video, but having the equipment capable of delivering a professional level of video and audio quality won't hurt your chances of becoming a successful YouTuber.

 We'd love to hear all about the gear you're using to capture your videos, so leave a comment and let us know.
