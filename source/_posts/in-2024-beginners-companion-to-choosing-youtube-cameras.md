Get the best pictures with the Sony DSC WX350\. This camera offers both still photos and video recording, using technology that minimizes how much the camera shakes, even if you’re filming on the go.

**Pros:** The image stabilizer makes this one of the best cameras for making YouTube videos out there, alongside of the 20x optical zoom. The battery life is quite long as well, which means you can get a lot of content done without any problems. Lastly, you can film in HD, which makes any YouTube influencer happy.

**Cons:** The LED screen can be quite dim, so it’s hard to see it when you’re out in bright sunlight; be sure you make adjustments before you go outside. There is also not your typical viewfinder installed, so experienced videographers may not like using it.

### 2\. [GoPro HERO8 Action Camera](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Waterproof-Accessory-Batteries-MicroSDHC/dp/B082MQFG76/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?crid=161JHBT1AHB2A&keywords=gopro+hero+8&qid=1583984353&sprefix=gopro%2Caps%2C363&sr=8-3) \- Best Wearable Sports Camera

**Pros:** The rugged, waterproof design of the HERO7 is a great option for anyone who is looking to be on the go with their YouTube. The integrated mount makes it simple for anyone who wants to put it on a selfie stick or something else, and it even has a companion app for easy, on the go editing!

**Cons:** The Wi-Fi capabilities are great, but the video transfer can take a bit of time due to how large the files may be. So, if you’re uploading the transfer, you may want to consider using the USB port instead. Also, the memory card slot is in an awkward place near the mount, so those with larger fingers may have trouble putting a card in there.

### 3\. [Logitech BRIO HD Webcam for Video](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-BRIO-Conferencing-Recording-Streaming/dp/B01N5UOYC4/ref=sr%5F1%5F6?keywords=Logitech+camera&qid=1583984539&sr=8-6) – Best Video Recording and Streaming Camera

**Pros:** The camera is incredibly easy to use and install; it connects to your PC with a USB type C to USB type 3.0 cord (backwards compatible to 2.0). You can easily tinker with all of the settings and such in the included software.

**Cons:** The arm is designed for thick edges; those with flat monitors or borderless monitors may find that it’s difficult to attach it to your monitor. The software is easy to use, but it’s missing a handful of settings that more experienced streamers would want to have available. There is a crop out background feature, but it can be hard to find and use.

### 4\. [PANASONIC Lumix G7 4K Digital Camera](https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Digital-Megapixel-Mirrorless-DMC-G7KK/dp/B00X409PQS/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?keywords=best+mirrorless+camera+for+youtube&qid=1583984713&sr=8-4) \- Best Mirrorless Camera for Professionals

**Cons:** There is a tracking focus, which can be good, but it makes the burst rate (which helps with motion blur) a lot slower. It does have a plastic build, rather than metal, so it’s not as heavy duty as other options. And, you need to purchase it with everything included, instead of just purchasing the body.

### 5\. [Sony CX405 Full HD](https://www.amazon.com/HDRCX405-Recording-Handycam-Camcorder-Battery/dp/B00HZ26X34/ref=sr%5F1%5F17?keywords=cam+recorder+sony&qid=1583985040&sr=8-17) \- Best Camcorder (Only) for Video

The battery life is quite long as well, which means you can get a lot of content done without any problems. Lastly, you can film in HD, which makes any YouTube influencer happy.

**Cons:** The LED screen can be quite dim, so it’s hard to see it when you’re out in bright sunlight; be sure you make adjustments before you go outside. There is also not your typical viewfinder installed, so experienced videographers may not like using it.

### 2\. [GoPro HERO8 Action Camera](https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-Waterproof-Accessory-Batteries-MicroSDHC/dp/B082MQFG76/ref=sr%5F1%5F3?crid=161JHBT1AHB2A&keywords=gopro+hero+8&qid=1583984353&sprefix=gopro%2Caps%2C363&sr=8-3) \- Best Wearable Sports Camera

**Cons:** The Wi-Fi capabilities are great, but the video transfer can take a bit of time due to how large the files may be. So, if you’re uploading the transfer, you may want to consider using the USB port instead. Also, the memory card slot is in an awkward place near the mount, so those with larger fingers may have trouble putting a card in there.

### 3\. [Logitech BRIO HD Webcam for Video](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-BRIO-Conferencing-Recording-Streaming/dp/B01N5UOYC4/ref=sr%5F1%5F6?keywords=Logitech+camera&qid=1583984539&sr=8-6) – Best Video Recording and Streaming Camera

**Cons:** The arm is designed for thick edges; those with flat monitors or borderless monitors may find that it’s difficult to attach it to your monitor. The software is easy to use, but it’s missing a handful of settings that more experienced streamers would want to have available. There is a crop out background feature, but it can be hard to find and use.

### 4\. [PANASONIC Lumix G7 4K Digital Camera](https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Digital-Megapixel-Mirrorless-DMC-G7KK/dp/B00X409PQS/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?keywords=best+mirrorless+camera+for+youtube&qid=1583984713&sr=8-4) \- Best Mirrorless Camera for Professionals

**Cons:** There is a tracking focus, which can be good, but it makes the burst rate (which helps with motion blur) a lot slower. It does have a plastic build, rather than metal, so it’s not as heavy duty as other options. And, you need to purchase it with everything included, instead of just purchasing the body.

### 5\. [Sony CX405 Full HD](https://www.amazon.com/HDRCX405-Recording-Handycam-Camcorder-Battery/dp/B00HZ26X34/ref=sr%5F1%5F17?keywords=cam+recorder+sony&qid=1583985040&sr=8-17) \- Best Camcorder (Only) for Video
