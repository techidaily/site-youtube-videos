Want to make a lasting impression on your YouTube fans? Have a great name! One of the vital decisions you have to take while beginning your vlog channel is selecting a vlog channel name. Believe it or not, your vlog channel name can impact the channel's success, so choosing the ideal one is essential. If you're unsure of how to have the best vlog channel names or are just looking for channel rebranding, you've come to the right place!

Here, we've 50+ lists of the best **YouTube channel names for vloggers**, along with sections discussing how you can select the ideal one plus their importance for the channel's growth.

* [Part 2: What to Consider Before Picking YouTube channel names for Vloggers?](#part2)
* [Part 3: 50+ Vlog Channel Names Ideas in 2021](#part3)
* [Part 4: Top 5 Free Vlog Channel Name Generators in 2021](#part4)
* [Part 5: Versatile YouTube Vlogs Editor](#part5)

## Part 1: Why are Vlog Channel Names Important?

Your Channel Name appears on your channel page, videos, and in YouTube's search results.

Just like a boring title, a generic vlog channel name will not last in the viewer's memory, precisely when there's so much competition vying for their YouTube engagement and attention. However, using attention-grabbing, punchy words can make for an entertaining YouTube channel name for vloggers. Remember, if your YouTube channel becomes successful, this will be the name that everyone knows you.

## Part 2: What to Consider Before Picking YouTube channel names for Vloggers?

Selecting a vlog channel name might not be simple as it seems. There are multiple options out there, so how will you know if you've chosen the right one?

To help you decide better, we've designed a step-by-step guide that shows you exactly how to develop some excellent **vlog channel name ideas**.

**Step 1: Consider the Image You Want to Portray**

Vlog channel names often highlight the brand or person on the other end. While not the case for all, you will notice how many define their overall objective or mission. This can be ideal to begin when thinking of new Youtube channel names for vloggers. Don't pretend to be someone you're not when you select your vlog channel name.

It's pretty vital that you, the channel owner, portray a message or an image that feels natural and provides your audience with an opportunity for best relation and recognition.

**Step 2: Stay Consistent with Your YouTube Niche**

The name you select must also reflect the niche upon which you based your channel. If you have a new channel, it can be hard to compete with more prominent vlog channels that cover important content topics. That's why you should try to be particular and become the best at designing topics for the subject you've selected.

While you may get required exposure with a random name to grow your channel, it's better, to begin with, something focal to the point.

**Step 3: Get a Feel for Your Target Audience**

Your target audience could be a huge factor in selecting the best name for a vlogging channel. Also, consider other vlog channels in the niche you've chosen and read through their video comments. Search out what your audience likes and vice versa. A precise scenario of your audience's interests will allow you to choose the best name for a vlogging channel.

**Step 4: Keep Your Channel Name Short**

A YouTube channel name, or username, is max up to 60 characters, but generally, you get nowhere near that! Long channel names are not essential and can also be confusing to the viewers. They can also be tough to replicate or spell while searching. A concise, short username for your YouTube vlog channel can also give you the image of having more authority.

**Step 5: Make Your Channel Name Memorable**

Remember, if your YouTube vlog channel namebecomes excellent, this will be the name that everyone knows you by. It will be there with your videos, your playlists, and thumbnails. You don't want a bad image that drags you downwards, but add creative writing tools like word plays, abbreviations, sibilance, alliteration, and puns to increase memorability.

If you're unsure of how to have the best vlog channel names or are just looking for channel rebranding, you've come to the right place!

Here, we've 50+ lists of the best **YouTube channel names for vloggers**, along with sections discussing how you can select the ideal one plus their importance for the channel's growth.

* [Part 2: What to Consider Before Picking YouTube channel names for Vloggers?](#part2)
* [Part 3: 50+ Vlog Channel Names Ideas in 2021](#part3)
* [Part 4: Top 5 Free Vlog Channel Name Generators in 2021](#part4)
* [Part 5: Versatile YouTube Vlogs Editor](#part5)

## Part 1: Why are Vlog Channel Names Important?

Your Channel Name appears on your channel page, videos, and in YouTube's search results.

Just like a boring title, a generic vlog channel name will not last in the viewer's memory, precisely when there's so much competition vying for their YouTube engagement and attention. However, using attention-grabbing, punchy words can make for an entertaining YouTube channel name for vloggers. Remember, if your YouTube channel becomes successful, this will be the name that everyone knows you.

## Part 2: What to Consider Before Picking YouTube channel names for Vloggers?

Selecting a vlog channel name might not be simple as it seems. There are multiple options out there, so how will you know if you've chosen the right one?

To help you decide better, we've designed a step-by-step guide that shows you exactly how to develop some excellent **vlog channel name ideas**.

**Step 1: Consider the Image You Want to Portray**

Vlog channel names often highlight the brand or person on the other end. While not the case for all, you will notice how many define their overall objective or mission. This can be ideal to begin when thinking of new Youtube channel names for vloggers. Don't pretend to be someone you're not when you select your vlog channel name.

It's pretty vital that you, the channel owner, portray a message or an image that feels natural and provides your audience with an opportunity for best relation and recognition.

**Step 2: Stay Consistent with Your YouTube Niche**

The name you select must also reflect the niche upon which you based your channel. If you have a new channel, it can be hard to compete with more prominent vlog channels that cover important content topics. That's why you should try to be particular and become the best at designing topics for the subject you've selected.

While you may get required exposure with a random name to grow your channel, it's better, to begin with, something focal to the point.

**Step 3: Get a Feel for Your Target Audience**

Your target audience could be a huge factor in selecting the best name for a vlogging channel. Also, consider other vlog channels in the niche you've chosen and read through their video comments. Search out what your audience likes and vice versa. A precise scenario of your audience's interests will allow you to choose the best name for a vlogging channel.

**Step 4: Keep Your Channel Name Short**

A YouTube channel name, or username, is max up to 60 characters, but generally, you get nowhere near that! Long channel names are not essential and can also be confusing to the viewers. They can also be tough to replicate or spell while searching. A concise, short username for your YouTube vlog channel can also give you the image of having more authority.

**Step 5: Make Your Channel Name Memorable**

Remember, if your YouTube vlog channel namebecomes excellent, this will be the name that everyone knows you by. It will be there with your videos, your playlists, and thumbnails. You don't want a bad image that drags you downwards, but add creative writing tools like word plays, abbreviations, sibilance, alliteration, and puns to increase memorability.

Using a template on Canva is as easy as clicking on the one you want and then dragging and dropping in your own images (if you donâ€™t want to use theirs) and changing what the text says.

Although Canva is free to use, and includes many free options for graphics and stock photos, it does also have some premium images and clip art which cost $1 each to use. Making a free banner is as easy as making sure none of the paid elements are in your design (theyâ€™re watermarked, so youâ€™ll know).

## 3\. [Wondershare PixStudio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/)

Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. It has various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc. You can create a beautiful design by simply dragging and dropping the elements and photos. The online platform is free to use all templates, just One-Click to download your creations and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.

PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.

## 4\. [Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html)

_In the above video, YouTuber BBelleGames walks you through all of the features you can use to build your channel art in Fotor._

Fotor is another free online drag-n-drop program with YouTube channel art templates. You can create your banner with Fotor in 4 steps. First open the Design feature and choose a template. Second, either choose a design or build one from scratch. Third, overlay images and any text you want over your background. Finally, save your banner and choose a format to export it in.

The free version of Fotor will work well enough for most YouTubers, but you can also upgrade to their paid Pro program to unlock more content and features.

## 5\. [Visme](http://blog.visme.co/youtube-banner-template/)

Visme offers 50 YouTube channel art templates which you can customize the text of for free. You just create a free account, choose the template that best suits your channel, insert your own text and edit that textâ€™s font and color.

## 6\. [YourTube](http://yourtubetheme.com/youtube-channel-art-templates/)

YourTube has a ton of really nice looking channel art templates you can download for free. The downloads include both PSD (Photoshop) files and the background images without text. This is great because youâ€™ll have an editable file you can build on in Photoshop, if you have it, and an image file you can use in combination with a free service like Canva if you donâ€™t.

## 7\. [Banner Snack](https://www.bannersnack.com/youtube.html)

Banner Snack is for all kinds of social media graphics from YouTube channel art to Twitter headers. Itâ€™s a high quality service thatâ€™s been used by a lot of major brands, like Lego and Xerox. The only downside of Banner Snack is that their free service is limited and has a watermark. You need to be paying at least $7 per month in order to get rid of the watermark.

Let us know if you know anywhere else to get free YouTube channel art templates!
