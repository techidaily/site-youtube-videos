Step 6\. Edit video  
Filmora lets you add effects and modify your video to your satisfaction. You can trim by dragging the end of a video clip on the right or left side. Likewise, you can apply other visual effects like insert transitions, add music, or even detach the audio and video to put background music of choice. More so, it’s easy to add text like opening titles, end credits, and so on to your video. Engage the available templates by dragging and dropping that of your choice to the timeline. Then add the appropriate text in Filmora’s preview window.

Step 7\. Export and Share  
Finally, you can export your video in any format. Just click on the "Export" button, and you'll be redirected to the "Output Window". Select the video file format in the "Format" menu and optimize your video YouTube.
